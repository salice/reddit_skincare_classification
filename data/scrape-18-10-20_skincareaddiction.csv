1,"Hi Everyone,

I've recently been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Salicylic Acid Acne Fighting Face Wash twice a day. I wash in the morning and I wash at night. So far I've been pleased with the results since most of the cleansers I've used before were benzoyl peroxide-based. However, I did not realize that salicylic acid had an exfoliating effect. The appearance of my acne has gotten a lot better, but at the cost of my skin getting considerably drier. I moisturize with Cetaphil Moisturing Lotion at night and I moisturize with Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion 30 SPF in the morning. I've even noticed that when I sweat while I workout, I have a tingling feeling on my face. Does this mean I should reduce the times I wash my face with the product?

I have oily and acne prone skin and used it during all summer, as a sunscreen, and didn't apply nothing else on my face in the morning. I feel like it moisturizes my skin but I would like to be sure. Since I still don't understand that much about skincare, I'm looking for someone who can help me understand if this also counts as a moisturizer.

I found that this is the only product that doesn't make me break out and actually helps treating any blemishes that I have.

1,"I just received my trial prescription of Curology last week and have been using it daily since Thursday (recommended M-W-F but the low dose made me decide to go all in).

The formula is: Tretinoin .009% / Azelaic Acid 9% / Clindamycin 1%

Previously I was using Skinceuticals .3 Retinol

The only different I've made is the Skinceuticals I would apply fairly soon after the shower (still moist skin). The Curology isn't immediately after washing my face but I'll still apply a small amount of fluid to help glide the product on my skin (usually just the Evian water spray but have used a hydrating toner).

I am 32/F and was looking for Curology as an anti-aging/treating hyperpigmentation. I have a fair complexion with a lot of sun damage. With the Skinceuticals retinol I feel like I was making progress but wanted to try a Tretinoin product over the winter and see how my skin handles it. I've been on the Skinceuticals for 2 months now and still have been dealing with flakiness but since I stopped one and started the other my flakiness went away and I'm just assuming it's a weaker product. Is that possible? I was afraid of trying tretinoin before going on vacation later this week but at this point I'm already planning on packing it and continuing to use it daily.

Has anyone experienced this while trying curology since the starting % is so much lower? I already planned on asking to remove the clindamycin and am thinking to see if they'd either up the tretinoin or just go to the .5 formula in Skinceuticals.",1571610039.0,[Product Question] Can an OTC Retinol be stronger than Curology Tretinoin .009?,1.0

Basically the title, I noticed I have some hyperpigmentation on my sternum where the gore of my bras sit. I think it is from rubbing or just being fitted there.

3,"I’ve been on my skincare journey for a little over a year now. I saw significant improvement about a month after switching up my routine last fall and was very pleased. I maybe got one pimple a month around my period that would heal pretty quickly. 

Old routine:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel
* Rohto Melano CC
* Simple Rich Moisturizer
* Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 50
* Smashbox Camera Ready CC Cream

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel 
* The Ordinary Mandelic Acid/Stridex Red box pads (switch off between nights)
* FAB Ultra Repair Cream
* The Ordinary Argan Oil
* Vaseline (inconsistent use, only when feeling very dry)

Fast forward to spring 2019. I went on really harsh antibiotics for latent tuberculosis and everything was fine right up until I finished my treatment. The last month or so I went to Europe and started using some product samples while I was there and noticed a slight uptick in CCs on my forehead. I returned to my old routine when I got home but things just got worse from there. By August my forehead was a war zone, small CCs everywhere with a couple inflamed ones at any given time. After doing some research I thought this might be FA from the harsh antibiotics so I started doing Nizoral masks and taking probiotics to try to get my own microbiome back full force. My face would look improved in the morning but then progressively worse by the end of the day so I decided I would never know if it was fungal unless I actually changed my whole routine to be FA safe. What a pain that was. It took me about a month and a half to completely change it because I didn’t want to change everything at once to make sure I wasn’t reacting to any particular product, but this is my new routine (bolded are new products): 

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* **Banana Boat Kids Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50**
* **Supergoop!CC Cream Daily Correct**

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* **Simple Foaming Cleanser**
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* Stridex Red box pads (about every other night or so)
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* Vaseline (inconsistent, only when feeling very dry)

Sometimes I’ll do a Nizoral Mask on nights I don’t use the Stridex pads. I’ve been using this entire routine for about 3 weeks now and I honestly just don’t know anymore. I still have a ton of CCs on my forehead. The rest of my face is ok, a couple breakouts here and there but nothing compared to my forehead. It’s really only one half of my forehead too, which I straight up don’t get. I’ll have one day a week where I think, hm maybe it’s actually starting to calm down. Then I wake up the next day to new small CCs and some of the old ones have become inflamed. What’s really irritating is even after coming to a head and healing, the same spot turns right back into a CC that becomes inflamed again a week later. It’s really taken a toll on my confidence and I’m just at a total loss with what to do. Even before I started my routine last fall my face was never this bad. The only conclusion I can draw are the antibiotics but I’ve been off them for nearly 4 months now and been taking probiotics for 2 months and nothing seems to be working.

3,"Hi.  
In the past 3 years, I have been struggling with acne and have tried different things until I found something that was kind of working. Recently I have travelled for +1 month to South Asia and then South-East Asia and because of the humidity and the high temperature, I have based my skincare on washing my face with a cleanser and applying moisturiser. I have been drinking insane amounts of water and a week into my trip, my skin was clear, plump and with a healthy glow. I am back home now, things are looking pretty good, with an odd small spot here and there, but nothing major as before. I am now looking to clear my face of acne scars and smoothen the texture, but I am not sure what to do in relation to my skincare as I am scared of using anything again as right now my skin is at its best, but also I am worried that if I don't use the products that helped me, I will go back to acne.

***AM***  
\- TO Glycolic Acid Toner  
\- The Body Shop Elderflower Eye Gel  
\- ELF Hello Hydration Face Cream  
\- (Altruist 50SPF Suncream - but not as much now. I know! :( )  
\- NYX Honey Dew Me Up (make-up primer)

***PM***  
\- The Body Shop Himalayan Charcoal Soap  
\- TO Glycolic Acid Toner / TO AHA BHA Peeling Solution (every week or so)  
\- TO Niacinamide / TO Hyaluronic Acid (if I do the peel)  
\- ELF Hello Hydration Face Cream  
\- Vichy Mineral 89

I've just been using toner and unscented moisturizer on it for years with okay results. There is still some dryness I feel like might be improved with a more moisturizing, still gentle toner, if I can find it. So far, I've just wasted my money. I have used witch hazel in multiple variations, as well as non-natural brands, and it all does bad things to my skin. This toner is good, but it does create massive shine (not oily just weird) and some dryness, usually on my forehead. 

Even when I did OCM, I seem to have broken the moisture barrier on my skin as it created many crinkly dehydration lines while somehow also leaving my skin feeling weirdly greasy and tight. I guess because it is so thin and sensitive, it can't handle much of anything without reacting negatively and usually those fun dehydration lines that cannot be resolved with moisturizer or oil. For years, I was doing fun experiments with various wipes, toners, cleansers, etc, and it all fucked my skin up worse. Reaching out here in case someone has similar issues and another toner worked better than mine.

23,"Hello Reddit,

I have neurodermatitis on my hands and feet. It’s much worse on my feet tho (see picture), although it really only comes out during winter but usually some cortisone creme fixes it. 

When my girlfriend (of 2+ years) saw my feet today, she completely lost it. 

She is really deep in the whole skincare thing and easily spends thousands on beauty products, cremes and what not. Her daily routine consists of 15 cremes, sprays, oils and anything else that allows you to smear on your body. 

I am fine with all that, I even pay for some of her products, lotion her entire body up every day (which obviously is a mutually beneficial thing since of course I love touching her, so I’m not complaining about that) and to be fair, she does looks damn near flawless. However I don’t use any cremes & stuff. I barely manage to put sunscreen on my face every now and then. 

Anyway, back to topic:
She told me my feet look disgusting and DANGEROUS (she literally said “dangerous”) and that I need a pedicure IMMEDIATELY(!) because according to her it looks like my foot is about to “fall off”. 

I think this is her skincare craze speaking and that she is overreacting. I have had this condition for 28 years and I’m fine, I never died from having dry skin. 

So please be honest: Do I really need a 60€ pedicure and is my life really in danger or should I just put creme on it like I did the past 28 years?

I thought for a while it was sun damage and I've been trying to lighten my skin up and reduce my hyperpigmentation because of that. The thing is that I've always been very diligent about my sunscreen usage and I always cover myself when I'm outside so that doesn't really make sense to me.  I did some digging and I found out that rosacea runs in my family and that both my uncle and grandmother had it pretty badly. I am now suspecting I may have a mild case of it and I'm not really sure what to do about it. I have a dermatologist appointment scheduled but its three months from now. What can I do from now to then to improve this issue?  My skin is constantly uncomfortable and I feel like no matter what I put on my face it seems to flare up and get either irritated or causes me to have pimples.

Retin A .25% every other day (Been using for almost three months)

10,"So it’s exam season and also beginning to get cold here in Canada, which means my skin has started to break out. I usually get a few pimples between my eyebrows, near my hairline and under my bottom lip. I work at a pharmacy, and one of my pharmacists there recommended that I try a gentle cleanser, namely Cetaphil. 

I gave it a go before bed, but about 15 minutes later I noticed my face felt very dry and VERY itchy. Checked in the mirror, and my face was red and covered in hives, and I got a small semi-circle of pimples and super dry skin under my eyes. Stopped using the cleanser, but the dry spots and some of the pimples remain. 

Now, when I use my moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel) or my usual cleanser (Aveeno Ultra-Calming Facial Cleanser) it burns like HELL. I stopped using my toner as well, L’Oreal Witch Hazel Toner, because it just hurts too badly. 

Also to be noted: about 4 weeks ago I was a dummy and decided to try a whole bunch of new products in a new routine without patch testing and also introduced them all at once. Something was making my skin very bumpy and red, so I’ve quit all of them and have only been using the products listed above for 2 weeks now until I tried Cetaphil 4 days ago. 
The products I tried were: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence, Sephora Vitamin C+E Serum, and LaNeige Sleeping Mask. 

[TLDR]: Started using a whole load of products all at once, something was irritating so stopped. Tried Cetaphil facial cleanser, dried up my skin and gave me terrible pimples that won’t go away and now my regular facial wash and moisturizer burns my face.

29, male.

I've been shaving my head daily for over a year with no issues. I started shaving my head as my hair began to thin and I didn't want to cling to it, so I generally have a pretty decent regrowth by the next day. But I don't generally get any irritation or anything of major concern from shaving.

The thing that drives me nuts is the amount of oil that my scalp seems to produce as the day progresses. It's not a huge or ridiculous amount, but it's noticeable. 

On an average day I've shaved by 7am and done my skincare routine, and by after midday it it's like i've visited the [shin-o ball-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVrbq8TtTo0).

* Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream
* Water Drench Cleanser 
* FIRMx Peeling Gel
*  Potent-C Power Eye Cream 

My skin felt moisturized, looked cleaner and had a glow to it. However, it was way out of my budget for the 4 products.

7,"(f, 23) I've been struggling with constant brakeouts for the past few months so I've recently decided to strip back my skincare routine to the basics as I think I irritated my skin using aha/bhas too often.

I was hoping that stripping down to the basics would clear my skin but I have some benzoyl peroxide at home incase it gets to that stage.

Cetaphil gentle cleanser (am&pm)
Simple water boost hydrating gel cream (am&pm)
Avene Cleanance SPF 30 (am)

3,"My skin is very deeply congested my cheeks are very bumpy, skin has a grainy texture.  Lots of whiteheads, microcomedones, almost as if every pore is blocked. Some are squeezable but many are not.

&#x200B;

When I noticed the bumps and blocked pores were not moving I tried to repair my skin barrier with lots of moisturiers recommended here but the bumps remained and got worse even with more clogged pores. I also tried the fungal method and it wasn't that.

How do I unblock my skin, removing the deep clogs and bumps while at the same time protecting my skins barrier function? 

Do I use BHA, do I steam my face, use a mask, oil cleanse? Do I apply a moisturier before or after differin? How long will it take to see an improvement so that I know I'm on the right path?

Also what about vitamins and diet? I think my sebum is very thick and sticky so it gets stuck in the pore rather then coming out to spread over the skin which means my skin is both oily / congested and dry. I have read before about diet and supplements for this problem like taking certain oils to thin out you own sebum a bit or using zinc, vitamin a or B5?

My nose,forehead, and cheeks have large pores that when squeezed produce sebum, and are oily, red and blotchy, and by the end of the day have accumulated a layer of dead skin. They are like this no matter what I do, washing daily, not washing for months, all natural treatments, Accutane, etc. When I was younger they were much worse but have mellowed out a little since I turned twenty. 

Around my mouth is where most of my breakouts occur. Usually painful pustules that aren't just like like a red bump but are also surrounded by inflammation so that even a tiny one will cause a reddened area half an inch in diameter. 

I also have bad dandruff on my scalp and in my facial hair that is impossible to get rid of, nothing works and sometimes it becomes so itchy I bleed. Occasionally it's in my eyebrows and chest hair too. On the back of my scalp I get frequent painful bumps that weep and crust over.

Hi all! I've been lurking SCA for about 6 months now, and am excited to join the community. I am (out of desperation) seriously dedicated to my skin, but it is quite mad at me. I have had two dermatologists (I live in two different states) both of which are at the ""IDK, add more retinol"" stage.

I've been told I have oily skin. I've been told I have dehydrated skin. I've even be told dry skin. Anything my skin could be, I've been told I have that type.

The straw that broke the camel's back was trying to treat for dehydrated skin and SFs. I switched to a LRP Toleraine Milk Cleanser and followed [Fifty Shades of Snail's SF Routine](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/) and this combination brought me 4-7 new pimples in 2  weeks.

- [Cerave in the tub](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) - It does a good job but I don't love it. I feel like it sits on my skin for far too long. And even though it is fragrance free there's an odd smell to it, I guess the blend of ingredients.

My skin is combination but has been more on the drier side past few months. I needed something to brighten my under eyes and area around my mouth. I went to the ordinary store and explained everything, they recommended me Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%. I've been using it for 2 weeks. I haven't noticed any brightening yet. But it's making my skin extremely oily. 

I only use it at night because it doesn't layer well with my makeup in the morning. I've used it different ways; right after cleansing, after cleansing and exfoliating and, after cleansing, exfoliating and toning. Regardless, I wake up every morning with oil piled up on my face. This doesn't bother me as much because I wash my face right away. But it's also breaking down my makeup. Everyday I come back home, my face is very oily and my makeup is gone from the cheek and around the nose area. It even breaks down my eye makeup. At the end of the day my face looks gross and oily. I'm not even using it in the morning. 

This has never happened to me before.  Sometimes in summer my face gets shiny at the end of the day but my makeup stayed intact. Plus it's cold here in Canada rn.

This is the only new thing I've added to my skincare or makeup routine so I can't say something else is making me oily. 

My skincare routine in the morning is cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. At night it's only this serum after cleansing.

46,"I've been a member and lurker of this sub for over 2 years now. One of the first things I learned is the Apricot scrub is a big no no. It gives microscopic tears and it's HORRIBLE for your skin. 

This year, I saw more posts challenging the accepted notion of ""microscopic tears"". I also saw posts encouraging members to share their beloved skincare tricks that go against the grain. St Ives scrub was mentioned on that thread as well. As we all know here, YMMV is an important golden rule. For over 2 years, I've been afraid to try this scrub based on the memes, bad reputation, and shaming. I want better skin, not worse and we all know st ives is a bad idea, right?

So...a few days ago, I decided to try it. I just had to see the effects for myself. I have very oily combo skin. My breakouts usually consist of small cc clusters and then a couple of smaller pimples. I get them on my forehead and cheeks. This sub has helped clear my skin, but I still get break outs if I'm not consistent...or when I sleep in my makeup for a week straight repeatedly (I know! Bad me!). Anyway, I had a breakout and rough texture that was not subsiding no matter what I did. My usual tricks were not helping much. That's when I decided to try the scrub. 

The scrub is fragranced and smells nice. When I used it, I noticed how gritty it was so I used light gentle circular motions. I made sure I wasn't pressing down hard. My skin was already aggravated and I didn't want to make it worse with harsh force.  I really focused on my rough cheeks and then gave the rest of my face attention. It was surprisingly relaxing and fun. Around a minute or two I rinsed it off and omg, WOW! While rinsing, it felt sooo soft! After drying it, I kept touching it. Despite my recent bout of roughness, my face is usually very soft, but this was next level. My face did feel a bit irritated/slight stinging afterwards, but that happens with my Ole Henriksen scrub and power peel as well, so I knew it was fine. My face looked really glowy. The scrub did pop/remove the tops of a few smaller white heads I had. I applied moisturizer, rosehip oil, and then too cool for school's pumpkin sleep pack to my face and went to bed.

I kid you not, in the morning when I woke up, most of my spots were gone! The really inflamed pimples had shrunken down very small. I was shocked and upset I didn't take pictures. I didn't expect it to work. I honestly expected a horrible outcome. I use chemical exfoliation regularly and a couple times a week I use a small silicone face scrubber as a manual exfoliator with my face wash. None of that got me the result I saw with st ives. My luxe ole henriksen scrub doesn't do what I experienced with st. Ives.

I know st ives is considered bad on this sub, but if you haven't tested your own mileage, you might be missing out on something helpful. I'll probably use it once every 1-2 weeks. It works.

Edit: Apparently my sleeping in makeup comment for a week wasn't explained well. I was still doing a morning skincare routine daily/removing it.

I’m about to start Roaccutane to (hopefully) solve my acne problem and I was hoping for some product recommendations. I know that Roaccutane can have some serious effects on the skin so I want to ease these side effects as much as possible as well as enhance the treatment. The last thing I want is to suffer through months of side effects before realising that my routine is the problem!

I (19F) currently have problematic combination skin and I'm on birth control, as far as I know, my ance is not affected by hormones very much. My current routine looks like this:

**AM**

* Drunk Elephant Slaai Cleanser OR Cetaphil cleanser if my skin is feeling more oily 
* TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% 
* Sukin Signature Facial Moisturiser 
* SPF 30

**PM**

* Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes
* Cetaphil Cleanser
* TO Glycolic Acid Toner
* TO Niacinamide + Zinc
* Sukin Signature Moisturiser 

I also have started using the Aztec clay healing mask as I've seen so many good reviews, only been using for two weeks but when I do my nightly routine goes cleanser, mask, moisturiser. 

I know that on Roaccutane it's not great to use harsh chemicals or exfoliators... I've never had overly sensitive skin before so this is new territory for me.

Every little bump or pore you see on my face has these often large hard-ish solid sebums trapped inside.

I used to incorporate Acne.org Benzoyl Peroxide into my routine which helped me achieve 90% clear skin but with consequences of itchy red, dry, and irritated skin. I tried using oils in my moisturizer, or changing my moisturizer completely to the Cerave Tub (which I think is too heavy for me - more clogged pores) but no change. Every time I would stop BP, my acne would come back like clockwork and I felt like a slave to the company so I stopped completely. 

I tried Salicylic Acid (Stridex Red) but no improvements whatsoever, which is very odd.

I tried Urea. It only irritated my skin and made it red.

I thought it was fungal acne so I used Head n Shoulders as a face wash and Ketoconazole as a face mask. Didn't make it worse, didn't make it better. 

I just want to disclose that I hate tacky or greasy things on my face. If something doesn't absorb right away I feel really really **icky** and have to wash it off.

When I was moving a few months ago, I sliced open my knuckle at the end of my pinky and it took a long time to heal.

2. Skincare routine: 

**AM:**

	◦	CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser - Normal To Oily Skin

	◦	TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 in winter when skin is dry

	◦	Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado as needed

	◦	DE Protini 

	◦	Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF if I’m going to be in sun more than 15 min. (I live north)

**PM:**

	◦	Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm if I’ve worn foundation or sunscreen - will go back to Clinique TTDO when this is done, because even though I like the fragrance, it’s a little irritating around my eyes

	◦	CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser

	◦	if I use AHA/BHA or Vit C, CeraVe Moisturizing Cream - perfect for deepest, driest winter, but too heavy for the rest of the year

	◦	if no AHA/BHA or Vit C, DE Protini

**2-3 times/week, at night:**

	◦	COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner -- I figure I should exfoliate sometimes and this is the least irritating chemical exfoliant I’ve found. I'm thinking of switching to AHA only, since I don’t think I really need BHA (blemishes are rare, and always occasion for me to shout out loud, ""OMG, everyone! I've got a pimple!"").

**OR**

	◦	Timeless Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid  (aka hotdog water) -- only added this because the last time I got a facial, the aesthetician’s only suggestion was a Vit C serum (guess I'm hoping it will help keep hyperpigmentation at bay)

3.		Top 3 Products: 

a)  Kiehl's avocado eye cream was a game changer for the eczema around my eyes. It doesn’t migrate, it doesn’t have fragrance, and it soothes the red scaliness that rings my eyes every winter. Usually, when I get moisturizer near my eyes—even frag free—they tear up and it starts the cycle over again. The avocado eye cream does give me milia if I use it twice daily, so I try to use it only when my lids feel dry and sore. 

b) I’m one of those DE Protini junkies who keeps shelling out because it makes my skin plump and smooth.

c) Also a Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence fan. I don’t like the alcohol scent, but it dries to a matte finish, doesn’t pill under makeup, and I forget I’m wearing sunscreen. I do find it drying without a moisturizer underneath, though.

I’ve been a lurker for a while, but I’m posting now because I’m in search of a replacement fragrance-free nighttime moisturizer without peptides or niacinamide, to replace the CeraVe cream. The CeraVe is great in winter, but it’s just too heavy the rest of the year (as is Cetaphil cream). I was using the Protini every evening, but I just started using Deciem’s skincare routine app, and it shows a conflict between both the Vit C (presumably any LAA) and the AHA/BHA and the Protini. I use the app because I'm rubbish at science. The app seems to show a conflict between both actives and any peptides or niacinamide. I have used and liked Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, LRP Toleraiane Sensitive Fluide, and CeraVe PM, but all have niacinamide.

I've been doing reading on tretinoin - my derm wants me on it, but I have been wanting to research more myself first.

It seems the main thing people talk about is how it increases cell turnover and say that is a good thing - which it might be, for short term gains for your skin. But given my cursory understanding of biology, doesn't that mean you need to run through more skin cell divisions, and perhaps over time that would lead to more chances for cancer - since cancer happens when cells have split enough times that there's eventually a mistake in their reproductive cycle. Given this, isn't tretinoin just pushing you towards skin cancer in the far future much faster?

I can't find any studies pointing either way - some saying that it reduces short term cancer risk, and other people claiming it increases cancer risk in the future. I heard that there just haven't been enough people on it long enough to be able to say - but I was hoping someone on this sub would know more about this than I do.

2,"In recent years, I've noticed that we've all become a lot savvier to different skincare ingredients. We are way more eager now to research what's in the products we put on our face (THANK GOD!). By now, you should know what exfoliation means, at least in broad terms. But, with so many new ingredients emerging, we're forced to step up our knowledge of skincare terminology almost every day.

The main ingredients I've noticed that people are eager to include in their regime are AHAs and BHAs. As you're probably aware, Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs) speed up cell turnover and gently exfoliate the skin without being abrasive or stripping, gently resurfacing and improving skin texture. AHAs (such as Glycolic Acid) are water-soluble, while BHAs (like Salicylic Acid) are oil-soluble, making them more effective at clearing out clogged pores.

Recently, a new acid family became increasingly popular, a family that is commonly referred to as LHAs - Lipo Hydroxy Acids (you may also see them listed on the label as capryloyl salicylic acid). The ingredient is increasingly found in creams, cleansers, toners and spot treatments thanks to its gentle exfoliating powers.

## SO WHAT ARE LHAS?

Lipohydroxy acid is a derivative of Salicylic Acid and has skin renewing, exfoliating, and acne-treating properties. Its gentleness comes from its slower cell penetration compared to Salicylic Acid, due to a higher molecular weight. LHAs are also more lipophilic than Salicylic Acid, this resulting in an individual cell-by-cell exfoliation that is associated with excellent tolerability. And while Salicylic Acid has a pH around 3, LHA’s has a PH around 5 which is much closer to the natural pH of the skin. This means it’s less harsh to the skin natural barrier and even suitable for sensitive skin. Lipo Hydroxy Acids are also a great alternative to BHAs for oily skin that is prone to sensitivity or dehydration.

As an anti-aging ingredient, the use of LHAs use has been proved to result in dermal thickening and has been found to be an excellent hyaluronic acid, collagen, and elastin booster.

It also has gentle astringent properties, making it great for those with acne-prone skin, clogged pores, or uneven skin texture. It penetrates the skin less than Salicylic Acid, with proprieties similar to those of Glycolic Acid.

## LHA PRODUCTS I LOVE

\*\*\*Disclaimer: The products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a product, and I thought I could share my experience.

I wanted to source the cleanest ingredient list as possible and to avoid products that contain drying alcohols, fragrance, and essential oils (you can't even imagine how hard it is to do this). It all came to a list of 3 products that I would personally recommend.\*\*\*

LHA was first developed by L’Oreal researchers in the 1980s, and as such, is found exclusively in L’Oreal or L’Oreal-owned skincare products.

1. **La Roche Posay - Effaclar Duo** \- Good Spot Treatment
2. **Skinceuticals - LHA Toner**
3. **Skinceuticals - LHA Cleanser**

These are the only products I found (if you can believe it) without/or with minimal nasty ingredients. I cannot understand why companies use SO MUCH ALCOHOL in products meant for Oily Skin. Overdrying is never a good choice, regardless of your skin type, so be aware. Being patented by L'Oreal, it's very hard for other companies to use LHAs. But these a good start for everyone who has Oily skin, prone to sensitivity or dehydration.

The only problems are that they smell QUITE strong (looked at the ingredients, they add menthol..) and they're pretty expensive. My skin seems to respond pretty well to salicylic acid so I'm looking for some recommendations on what to replace these with!

What has worked for you? And I'd prefer the products to be specifically salicylic acid rather than just a different exfoliant. Having more than once type of exfoliant is fine, as long as salicylic acid is still in there.

14,"Bioderma has reformulated these two sunscreens without **Octocrylene, Avobenzone, and Tinosorb M** (responsible for the white cast) that are common in their other formulas. I had been hoping for exactly this but didn't know it been done until recently.

They have no white cast and they didn't feel heavy to me. They are NOT matte, but the finish ranges from very dewy at best to very shiny at worst, depending on circumstances (skin type, humidity level, how many products you're layering this on). I must say instances where I found it very shiny were very few, and most of the time I found it just very dewy, glass skin like.

Both contain **Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Tinosorb S, Octisalate, and Uvinul T 150**. They're alcohol-free and fragrance-free. The Lait has a slightly longer ingredients list than the Spray and contains vitamin E.

This [retailer page](https://www.easyparapharmacie.co.uk/bioderma-photoderm-max-spray-spf50-400ml.html) lists a PPD rating of 33 for the Spray but no rating is given for the Lait.

[Photoderm MAX Spray SPF 50+ 400ml](https://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/max-spray-spf-50)

**Cost:** I got the big 400ml spray bottle for 16,90€ at a French pharmacy. One spray fills about 90-95% of a 1/4 tsp so I usually just apply one spray of it over the face and neck. A 400ml bottle would give 320 doses of 1.25ml (or a 1/4 tsp). The period-after-opening symbol for the Photoderm sunscreens says 6 months, so a bottle would be enough sunscreen for twice daily applications for the face and neck for 5-6 months. That means spending just 33€ a year per person on sunscreen for just the face ! The official website only shows this new formula for the SPF 50 in the 400ml bottle, not the SPF 30 or SPF 50 in the 200ml bottle yet.

**Application:** I spray it in my hand and apply it. It goes on a bit oily on application but spreads easily and sets quickly without feeling heavy or sticky. Touching your face afterward, it'll feel moist and smooth but not greasy. You can still feel it on your face for about four hours, after which you'd want to renew the application for continued protection. I like to think that how much of it I can still feel on my skin gives me an indication of how it's breaking down over the course of time and whether I'm still being protected or not. I didn't experience pilling and didn't notice any smell. I'm careful with swiping this lightly on my under eye area with my fingertips, and don't have issues with stinging. I haven't sweated with these, so I don't know what happens if it runs down into your eyes.

**Finish:** The finish ranges from very dewy to very shiny. It is very shiny when I use it in the morning after my many steps routine that layers multiple hydrating and moisturizing products. If I reduce my routine a little or when I use it to reapply halfway throughout the day when my face is drier, it sets quickly to a very acceptable level of very dewy. I'm thinking most people with a basic routine might not find it too shiny, unless they have very oily skin maybe or are in a humid climate. The shine is pretty much on par with the Klairs Airy UV Essence. I find the spray bottle and the thin texture makes it very easy to reapply during the day (I kinda had been slacking on that with other sunscreens). It's not something you can carry around, though, but you could buy a smaller spray bottle or an airless pump to put it in your purse.

**Notes:** I had been breaking out prior to this when trying out the Purito Unscented sunscreens, and since switching to using only this Spray since a week ago my skin has cleared up and evened out and the highly dewy finish this gives me makes my skin look just glowy and healthy. It's not quite a saran wrap look, but actually gives a glass skin finish. I look better moisturized and a lot less flaky with this too (from Tretinoin and Granactive Retinoid use). Also after a week I noticed that my face finally matches the lighter skin tone on my neck and the rest of my body. My face was weirdly browner before, with a demarcation line like The Mask. I had been using AB sunscreens mostly.

[Photoderm MAX Family Milk SPF 50+ 250ml](https://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/max-family-milk-spf-50)

**Cost:** The new Lait formula exists only for now in this huge 250ml tube with the blue ""Famille"" label. I ordered it from a French pharmacy website for 12,99€. The 100ml tubes without the blue circle are still the old formula.

**Finish:** It is very similar in finish to the Spray. It is thicker and goes on more like a milk at first, but after you rub it in feels the same as the Spray. I used it to reapply midday yesterday, a whole 1/4 tsp of it, and then some, all over my face and neck. It was very shiny but when I checked in the mirror an hour later the finish had set to a very acceptable level of dewy. I've only had it a day so I haven't used it a lot yet.

The expiry date for the Spray is February 2022 and December 2021 for the Lait, so I'm assuming they're less than a year-old. When I checked other pharmacy websites and eBay resellers, some still listed the old formulas with Octocrylene, Avobenzone and Tinosorb M, so you have to check the ingredients list to make sure what you're getting. This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/devpq2/sun_care_psa_bioderma_photoderm_max_spray_formula/) compares the old and new formula for the spray.

Some info about me: I have medium tan South East Asian skin tone, NC 35. I used to have oily skin but don't anymore since getting into skincare and using a very hydrating routine.

My holy grail sunscreen ideally contains at least Tinosorbs, Uvinuls, and no Octinoxate, Octocrylene, Oxybenzone, alcohol or fragrance, is light and matte and cosmetically elegant. This ticks all the boxes, except for the matteness, but at least it is not horribly shiny, and is more like dewy *most* times. And if you don't mind it, you can always powder on top or use a blotting paper.

Chances are I might not like this during the summer months when it's 38°C and minimum 60% humidity every day, but after a more than a year-long search of the perfect sunscreen (I must have tried like 30 at least, maybe more) I'm ready to settle on these for the rest of the year. I hadn't found anything from the French pharmacy that had the best formula *and* finish, but this new Bioderma Spray version is the best compromise for high reliable European protection, clean formula and daily wear, along with being excellent value (and likely reducing waste) !

This makes a great sunscreen for daily use while keeping higher PPD but alcohol-containing sunscreens like La Roche Posay Shaka Fluid for beach/sport days and hikes. Plus the big bottle vs little bottle thing.

I hope they reformulate their other sunscreens similarly, like the Aquafluid, most particularly the tinted versions. I like to use the Golden one for when I like a little coverage on the days when I may need it.",1571417003.0,[Sun Care] Bioderma Photoderm Max Spray SPF 50+ and Lait Famille SPF 50+ reformulated without white cast,0.84
1,"I am pretty sure that my Onexton (Clindamycin Phosphate + Benzoyl Peroxide) cream has stopped working, as it seems to be doing nothing at preventing new pimples.

I thought the Benzoyl Peroxide was supposed to prevent the bacteria from becoming resistant to the Clindamycin Phosphate. 

I have also been using Tretinoin 0.8/0.1% gel since October as well, which has helped a ton, but the increase I think has made my forehead in particular really dry even with moisturizer.

When I was moving a few months ago, I sliced open my knuckle at the end of my pinky and it took a long time to heal.

It was a pain in the ass and when it finally healed it has left a nasty dark scar. It seems more like a circulation thing as I can “rub away” the redness but the blood pools back into that knuckle.

My skin freaked. I was getting large cystic eruptions all over my cheeks, painful with no end in sight. At this point I was so emotionally done with dealing with acne. I got back from my trip and all I was doing was putting sunscreen on and washing it off at the end of the day. That's it.

I know it's not the tretinoin causing the problem, because I've used much stronger tret prescriptions in the past with no issue. My gut says it's the azaelic acid, because my skin responds poorly to all acids, but everybody says AA is sooooo gentle.

7,"# What is Bakuchiol?

Having a long history in Ancient Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, Bakuchiol has been part of the skincare world for ages. You can find the skin-loving ingredient in the plant Psoralea corylifolia. Its Bachi seeds are packed with antioxidants and are known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Bakuchiol acts as a phytochemical that has demonstrated antiageing effects when applied topically, working similarly as Retinol, without the side effects. 

# What's the difference between Bakuchiol and Retinol?

Bakuchiol and Retinol show similar gene expression in the skin, so they both up-regulate the production of collagen and elastin. They both help with reducing fine lines and wrinkles, fading scars and hyperpigmentation, and boosting cell renewal. Probably the most notable difference between the two is that while Retinol can be irritating and cause redness, dryness, peeling, and sun sensitivity, Bakuchiol is not. Bakuchiol is promising as a more sustainable alternative to Retinol and is generally tolerated better. Moreover, Bakuchiol does not cause photosensitivity, so it's safe to use even during the day. Modern science is backing the ingredient, too. [A study by the British Journal of Dermatology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947134) demonstrates that Bakuchiol is comparable with Retinol in its ability to improve photoaging. Moreover, Bakuchiol and Retinol both significantly decreased wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, with no statistical difference between the two. The only difference is that Retinol users did report more facial skin irritation and stinging.

# Who will benefit the most from Bakuchiol?

Almost all skin types can benefit from the use of Bakuchiol. The ingredient is ideal for anyone who cannot tolerate Retinol, such as those with sensitive skin or rosacea, or anyone who is looking for a non-irritating, natural ingredient with anti-aging benefits. The antioxidant-rich ingredient is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, making it great for those with oily, acne-prone skin, and congested pores.

# Bakuchiol products that I personally love

\*\*\*Disclaimer: The products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a product, and I thought I could share my experience. 

I wanted to source the cleanest ingredient list as possible and to avoid products that contain drying alcohols, fragrance, and essential oils (you can't even imagine how hard it is to do this). It all came to a list of 3 products that I would personally recommend.\*\*\*

1. **Best overall (in my opinion):** *Bybi Beauty 1% Bakuchiol Booster*. First of all, this is 12 British Pounds (\~15-16$ so great price point) and contains only two ingredients: 1% Bakuchiol and 99% Squalane. I assume nobody will have a problem using this, not even the most sensitive skin unless you have a particular allergy to one of these two ingredients. 
2. **Awesome ingredient formula:** *AO Skincare RAW NURTURE PM TREATMENT.* This nighttime treatment is an antioxidant and nutrient-rich that hydrates and stimulates collagen production. It's formulated with peptides, fatty acids, and cell-renewal ingredients. The dynamic active is Bakuchiol, and also contains humectants such as Red Algae, Lactic Acid, and Honey to attract moisture and hydrate the skin. The Harakeke Seed Oil and Totarol are powerful antioxidants that literally ""feed"" your face and protect against environmental damage. The Kiwi Seed Oil improves elasticity and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The treatment also contains Vitamin C and Bearberry Leaf Extract to brighten your complexion and reduce photodamage. The Olive Leaf Extract is an oxygenating agent and is good enough to penetrate even thicker layers of skin to provide long-lasting moisture.
3. **Clean Ingredient List:** *Herbivore Bakuchiol Retinol Alternative Smoothing Serum.* I really like that this contains PHAs which I personally love, and provide a very gentle exfoliation while hydrating. It has Tremella mushroom to boost the skin-refining effects of Bakuchiol and works very well for hydration. 

I know there are some popular Bakuchiol serums such as Glow Cycle™ Retin-ALT Power Serum by Ole Henriksen but I will never go near the thing because FRAGRANCE is listed in the upper part of the ingredient list. Plus it contains other ingredients that I personally find sensitizing. 

The other popular one is the SQUALANE + PHYTO-RETINOL SERUM by Biossance. This one contains Essential Oils, and not just any essential oil but Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Peel Oil. This oil is way too strong to ever touch your face (it's used to treat cellulite so you can imagine how disruptive it is for the skin natural barrier of your face). Many people reported irritation after using this including swollen eyes or strong reactions. 

This small ""article"" was to encourage people to try natural alternatives to Retinol without fear. I know how confusing it is to find good products in today's oversaturated market, but if you have any other questions, I'm here to help.",1571399547.0,[Routine Help] Retinol Vs.

My skin has only recently cleared up after years of problems as I've found something that actually works for my skin which is fantastic.

My friend who has skin that can withstand anything without getting a single spot says I should use antibacterial wipes on my face which doesn’t sound like such a good idea for me as my skin is quite sensitive and very prone to breakouts and this might give me a rash - which I don't really want to risk haha.

So I go to my appointment, she prescribed azelaic acid, tretinoin, and minocycline. I had never been on minocycline, only doxycycline. The derm said to watch out for headaches and dizziness. I said okay and left. 

The headaches were more like migraines with aura for me which was NOT good. I couldn’t focus my eyes, I lost my balance, there was so much pressure on the back of my neck at the base of my skull. I went online and found the list of side effects as well as did some research on Reddit about other users’ experiences. I realized this antibiotic was not for me after 6 days. 

On the 5th day I started getting a little sick. I had a cough and some body aches. Found out that’s a side effect. Day 6 was the last day I took it. I couldn’t focus while driving and I couldn’t look down without pain. Said fuck this I’m not taking it. 

Day 7 was last night. I didn’t take it. I felt some itchiness around my mouth but figured it wasn’t a big deal since I have sensitive skin and was probably breaking out. Before bed I could feel a pimple coming so my anxiety kicked in and I tried to pick at it. It started throbbing like crazy. I put some honey on it and covered it with a bandaid.

My lip was FUCKED this morning when I woke up. Turns out, this little pimple was a massive cold sore outbreak. Mind you, I haven’t had a cold sore in 10 years. The last time I had one it was tiny and in the middle of my lip. I had mono at the time. Never had another one. 

I started freaking out. This antibiotic weakened my immune system enough to make me break out in cold sores. I had to call the derm and tell her what happened and had to pick up these horse pill antivirals and some doxycycline. I am so upset. 

I’m not mad at her, I’m mad at my body. I’m mad that an antibiotic that comes with serious (however supposedly uncommon) is even ALLOWED TO BE PRESCRIBED. All because I wanted my skin to be clear. Well joke’s on me. No more cystic acne, but instead a giant explosion of pain and weeping that will probably scar because my skin is garbage and scars so easily. 

Anyway! My point is, if you have a sensitive system, don’t take minocycline. If you have any underlying illnesses, conditions, autoimmune whatever anything, don’t take this. I have some autoimmune liver thing I now need to check on too. If you need any more info message me!

When I take a shower (I've tried both cold and warm) I sometimes end up getting a strange red pattern accross my forehead, nose and cheek. This becomes pretty intense, and fades after 2-3 hours. I only used to get it on my forehead, but it's been spreading or something over the past few months.

I've also noticed that I sometimes get these pimple like spots in these areas, except they get extremely itchy and become white (not puss) in the centre, and red around the outside - almost like when you bitten by an insect or something. These spots tend to reduce and dissapear by the end of the day.

Male, 20

I've never had a skincare routine. Thank god I have been blessed with good skin genetics but lately I've been having some problems and even without those problems I think it is time to take my grooming more seriously.

My main problem issue right now is dry skin. I do have a small amount of pimples but it's few and they clear themselves relatively quickly.

So, today I went with a dermatologist trying to get into a new routine mainly because I was intimidated at how many steps and products were talked about here in this subreddit. At the end of the appointment I was a bit disappointed. First of all I mentioned how i had dry skin all over my body but it stopped (Except for my face) when I started drinking more water and he basically laughed at me for being naive saying that most probably didn't have any relation. Then he proceeded to watch my face and prescribe the same [face soap](https://www.medicamentosplm.com/Home/productos/alergibon_jab%C3%B3n_hipoalerg%C3%A9nico/60/101/6199/475) and the same [antibiotic](https://www.dokteronline.com/es/dalacin-t) that he gave me back when I was about 15 and my main problem was huge pimples. That seemed weird to me as I wasn't there for the pimples and I told him that I basically stopped washing my face precisely because it just left my skin way too dry to the point of cracking (If i touch my face dry skin falls off), again he just dismissed me and said it was normal. Because i have very few pimples i prefer living with those than a completely dry face. I asked him if he was going to give me something to put on after my face wash but he just said no and told me that having dry skin after washing is normal. I kept asking about the dryness and he basically just said ""yeah don't worry wash your face with the soap and use this antibiotic gel"" (As I mentioned, i have experience with those and while they help with pimples, they just leave me dry as cardboard)

I also mentioned how i had a lot of dry flakes in my hair some months ago. I went on to [r/HaircareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/) trying to get advice on a hairstyle and some people helped me with my scalp issues. They taught me about not washing everyday, using shampoos without sulfate and using a tea tree conditioner (I never used any conditioner). It did not solve it 100% through but it did improve the situation A LOT. I used to leave black shirts really gross full of flakes and now I don't see any unless I actively look for flakes in a magnified mirror. If my problem was a 10, i managed to dial it back to a 3. Well, my dermatologist basically told me that was really stupid and that I should be washing my hair everyday. He recommended a [shampoo](https://www.medihealth.net/producto-pirimed?url=pirimed) which does seem like it is made for seborrheic dermatitis (That I do believe I could have) , the problem is that it has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I told him about how Head and Shoulders destroyed my hair and he just said yeah that's too bad but try this one. I was about to buy it but I don't have much money right now and in the short span that i have followed [r/haircarescience](https://www.reddit.com/r/haircarescience/) advice i I did notice some improvements.

I don't want to judge based on appearances but I did notice that the dermatologist is quite old and he attends mainly older people (Late 60s and up) and his office is in his house. He does have his degree. I really don't like judging based on this but i did notice it.

I know i am basically asking a bunch of unknown people from god knows where to judge a fully trained medical doctor but I really left with the feeling of dissapointment. I don't follow advice blindly, even if people in this subreddit and [r/haircarescience](https://www.reddit.com/r/haircarescience/) are not doctors I always get full explanations as to why I should do what they recommend and how things work, my doctor basically just said ""trust me on this one, no explanation""

23,"Hi there!  I'm a female, early to mid 20s, and I'm having trouble finding a skincare routine that doesn't make my face all red.  It generally is kinda red most of the time (if anyone has any advice to make it less red, please let me know!) but after applying moisturizers it gets even more red!  I've also noticed it's at its most even and calmest right after I wash my face (doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold) and before I moisturize it.  It also looks extremely calm and smooth after I use a yogurt mask (just plain yogurt on my face for 15 minutes) and before I moisturize.


Here's a link to my face: [https://imgur.com/a/zWJl2Fl] (https://imgur.com/a/zWJl2Fl)

And here's the products I've been using in my routine:

SheaMoisture African Black Soap

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Exfoliating Cleanser (once a week)
Yogurt as a mask (once a week)

The Body Shop Vitamin E Moisture Cream

Olay Daily Moisturizer SPF 15


I generally use a moisturizer as well as a moisturizing sunscreen because otherwise my face is really dry and the sunscreen dries it out even more.


Here are the other products I've tried as replacements/supplements to my routine:


Walgreens Hydrating Water Gel (store brand version of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Water Gel) and straight Vitamin E oil mixed together--this is the one I use most often but have recently replaced with the Body Shop moisturizer because I ran out

Thayer's Rose Water Witch Hazel--makes my face very red and sometimes bumpy/irritated

Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer

CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 30 (used with another moisturizer)

Straight vitamin E oil on my face--it makes me break out!  It occasionally doesn't make my face as red, but not by much.  I will often mix it into any of my sunscreens or moisturizers.


All of these have made my face very red, even redder than usual!  I'm not sure why.  I eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and have had this redness whether or not I'm stressed.  I notice it the most whenever I'm out of the house and at work or school, but it's present at home, too.  I have no known allergies except a mild oral reaction to bananas, which I generally avoid.  


And the thing is my face has always been a bit too red.  I used to put foundation all over it to recolor it.  The moisturizers just make it worse.  But I really really wish I could go out in public without having to use foundation!  The pimple scars don't bother me so much, it's just the redness!


Would anyone recommend me a new moisturizer/toner/sunscreen/routine to try to help lessen and not increase the redness on my face?  Also, if anyone has any tips on making it a little smoother and evening the skin tone, to make it not as blotchy, those would be greatly appreciated!

I've never been really prone to acne but in the last couple of months, especially after the summer ended, my skin has just gotten worse. I'm not too comfortable with showing photos so I'll describe to the best of my ability. I have always had relatively large pores (apparently this is genetic) but they've become increasingly more clogged in the past few months. I currently have acne scars and some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. I also have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads on my nose. My skin is naturally oily but is also pretty dry around the nose at the moment.

I need all the suggestions I can get to make my skin at least a little better. I used to have an elaborate skincare routine that worked (my skin was relatively clear) but it suddenly started causing breakouts, so I abandoned that routine.

**My routine as of now:**

AM: Wash face with water

PM: Burt's Bees Natural Cleanser (w/ cotton extract), Garnier Micellar Water for sensitive skin and Vaseline to moisturize before sleeping

**My previous skincare routine:**

PM: Cetaphil gentle cleanser, micellar water, Cetaphil moisturizer

Any tips on moisturizer would be great as well. I hate how my skin feels sticky in the morning and throughout the next day but I haven't been successful in finding a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts.

[routine help] So as the title says, I want to cut down my routine for simplicity, and, although I've got a decent supply of my current products, I will at some point have to order stiff out there. So less is better. 

Current routine is; 

AM. Simple tea tree face wash,
TO Hyaluronic,
TO Niacinamide,
Simple SPF 30.

PM. Simple tea tree face wash,
TO vit c suspension 23%.
        
Wait maybe an hour because I'm not too sure about how these two interact.

TO retinoid 5%.

Then twice a week TO AHA BHA peel.


So I want to know opinions on what to cut as well as if vit c and retinoid can be used together?

And maybe something more portable as a face wash, like a charcoal soap bar or something?

Best sheet mask for hydration

* full product name(s);  Simple® ""Rich moisture sheet mask"" with botanical extracts
* how long you've been using it; Roughly once a week last 6 months
* what's the packaging like; Thin, plastic cover, different green leaf-like shapes
* product  feel and smell; Very soft, slightly sticky with a slight hint of some  fresh smell (can't really put my finger on what exactly)
* what  are the positive and negative effects; POSITIVE: Great hydration, easy/  quick absorption, amazing feeling skin after just one use NEGATIVE:  Face feels sticky afterwards, so it's best to do before bed if you want  your skin to absorb the most possible liquid
* does it do what it should / what you bought it for; Yes, beyond all expectations",1571342729.0,"[Review] Holy Grail item: Simple® ""Rich moisture sheet mask"" with botanical extracts",0.75

My skin is not dehydrated as far as I can tell. No redness, flaking, tightness etc.

AM: 
-Rinse with warm water (mostly to remove vaseline from PM) 
-Garnier Oily skin micellar water (in green bottle)

PM: 
-Vanicream Gentle cleanser (w/ Clarisonic 3x/week)
-Stridex (red box) 
-Sebamed Clear Face Gel
-Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment around eyes/healing pimples etc


I'm just kind of at a loss as to what I should change/add to deal with this oil. I'm currently going through at least 5 blotting sheets per work day. I've pretty much given up on base makeup, so I just blot and powder every hour or so and end up looking super flat/cakey.

**Feeling lost**

so after switching dermatologist for the third time I finally found one that listened to me (or tried) and didn’t put me on Accutane, she sent me Adapalene 0.3 and spiro 100 mg but sha gave me some weird ass advices.

**Skin background**: my hormonal acne problem started since I was 17(25 now) after trying everything people told me dove soap, sulfur soap, lemon, toothpaste ... (yes, I’m sorry for my skin) I decided that was time to see the derm. what I remember from this *first appointment* is that he immediately send me Accutane for a year, sunscreen everyday (local brand) and washing face day and night with Neutrogena salicylic acid cleanser and YES no moisturizer , as expected my skin cleared up but after a few months after I finished the treatment my hormonal acne came back EVEN WORSE. After that I *switched dermatologist for the second time* and yes again Accutane this time 4 months, stopping 1 month and continuing with other 6 months she told me to keep using the same sunscreen and Neutrogena cleanser (no moisturizer) long story short my acne came back like 10 times worse, my combined skin became dry and dehydrated and super sensitive (first perioral dermatitis rushes I’ve ever had).

after that I kind of lost faith and started my skincare journey by myself I found out about **Reddit** and I can’t say how much this community changed things for good, I started to remove make up properly, to use moisturizer and just washing my face at nights my hormonal acne was still there but at least my face was hydrated and looking healthy, after a lot of trial and error I found the triggers of my perioral dermatitis(tea tree oil and sodium lauryl sulfate) and found my worst enemy ***BUTYLENE GLYCOl*** , after almost going crazy wondering why if I was using gentle products why my skin was so itchy and I was getting so much closed comedones I switched products like crazy spent so much money until (thanks do incidecoder.cosdna,skincarisma) I made the connection to butylene glycol. Now I’ve been 3 months BG free (this was so difficult it’s almost in every product) and no more closed comedones and itchiness.

Some model friend recommended a good dermatologist who helped with her hormonal acne. **third dermatologist,** she actually listened to me didn’t put me on Accutane, she actually believed my allergy to BG, send me adapalene .3 and spiro and sent me a list of recommended products for a new routine, on the other hand she told me not to use moisturizer (I don’t know why they want to dry the hell out of my skin when it’s not even oily) I told her that I wanted to use moisturizer so she send 2 recommendations one with butylene glycol (so she didn’t take the time to check the ingredient list of her recommendations) and the other contains lactic acid (I’m pretty sure that if I’m on adapalene using other acids will irritate my skin) she told me to use moisturizer just the nights that I’m **not** using adapalene (3xweek), told me to change my beloved Vanicream gentle cleanser for an expensive avene cleanser that contains fragance ... and to use it twice a day (again ), she recommended Eucerin sun face oil control dry touch spf 50 (contains alcohol denat). I could email her telling all of this and asking for more recommendation but I lost faith again

8,"I guess I'll start with a bit of the story on what lead up to this? 

 I used to be quite into my skincare but I fell off the wagon a bit while living with my (now ex) boyfriend.  I recently met a guy I really like and he was one of the few people to guess my age correctly like, ever.  In the UK there is this law that you can be asked for ID for energy drinks and the age limit is 16-  I have been refused sales of red bull before when I forgot my ID, because I'm small and blonde and look young in general. So when this guy correctly said I'm 23/24 it was a massive kick up my butt to get my shit together again.   I have to admit, my skin has been quite bad lately, with a bunch of hormonal acne spots on my chin and some around my forehead.  My forehead has become oily while my cheeks look bumpy and textured/congested . I've been previously diagnosed with KP as a child and still get it a little bit around my face.  Horrible combination of oily and dry at the same time in different areas. I'm not sure what has caused these to come up all of a sudden but I imagine it's that I haven't been using any products with anything active in them lately. 

My routine has basically consisted of taking off my makeup with bioderma sebium, sometimes I used an Avene gel cleanser in the morning and then any random moisturiser (I've been trying to use up Avene Clearance Expert lotion- not my favourite tbh) for under my  makeup.  Super lazy... I guess I've paid the price for it.  I don't even know what's in the Avene products. 

While my skin was good, I think I used Nip+Fab Teen Skin Pore blaster/Bioderma Sebium, various glycolic acid products alternatively (mostly Alpha H liquid gold and the Nip+Fab pads), as well as Ren Clarimatte as my moisturiser.  Quite simple but was very effective!  I've loved the Ren gel cream for a looong time now, but find it a bit expensive so I tried finding cheaper alternatives many times, unsuccessfully.  My skin was still oily enough for me to use a powder foundation as my base since the natural oils on my skin would melt it very nicely after an hour or so. 

I started watching videos and reading posts on here and found out about The Ordinary. Someone I totally missed the existence of their products 'cause I wasn't keeping up with the beauty community much. I went a bit wild and bought basically everything of theirs to try. 

I started with trying out the Niacinimide+Zinc and Buffet along with the Natural Moisturizing Factors+HA cream. My pores instantly looked better so I kept using them for maybe 3 days. My cheeks magically looked smoothed out and my makeup had honestly never looked better on my cheeks.  

Then one evening I decided to slap on the AHA+BHA Peeling solution cause I felt like I had a lot of dead skin and textured bumps on my cheeks that could do with getting rid off, and while it didn't sting or anything I think my skin wasn't too happy with it. I hadn't used acid for a long time and it may have been a bit much. It was actually fine until I next applied the serums again in the morning, and realised anything I put on my skin would sting, including BB cream, and putting on the niacinamide caused huge red blotches to appear on my skin.  Unfortunately, during these couple of days I also had to bleach my roots and my skin got even angrier from the bleachy water running over my forehead as I washed it out.  I can't remember if I did this before or after the Peeling solution. My forehead hurt like crazy whenever anything touched it at this point.. 

For 2 days my forehead was super angry, dry and tight as if it was sunburnt but without the tan. I got a  couple of new spots on my cheeks that weren't there before. Bottom half of my face just got super dry and flakey. I did my best to get it to chill out my applying the oils I have on hand - Kiehl's midnight recovery and TO Rose Hip Seed Oil. I think this has mostly helped but I still have these weird cheek zits I don't normally get. 

I've kept reapplying the Rose Hip Seed Oil as soon as my face feels dry again and keeping it on overnight as it seems to be healing the irritation really well. Even though my face looks okay now like 3/4 days later, whenever I've tried to put on a bit of either the Niacinide or Buffet serums I experience stinging on my cheeks.  My skin has never been this dry and doesn't even look oily when I put the oil under my makeup as well as BB cream. Madness.  If there's anything else I can do I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice on what products to use. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - I'm looking for help on how to heal my irritated, stinging skin after over-using active ingredients (combined Niacinamide, Buffet and chemical peel in a  short space of time.. got a bit over-excited), and advice on whether I should keep using certain TO products or not!  Should I cut it out completely for a while or keep using them in small amount despite the slight stinging on application?

16,"Just thought I'd share my experience with chronic acne and some things Ive learned along the way. It might help some people figure out what is going on with their skin.  

So starting I am a 23 year old male. I always had acne prone skin but nothing major. I would look back to when I thought my skin was bad and I always thought I only wish I had that skin from x amount of years ago. Everyone freaks about their skin depending on what their baseline is. If they have perfect skin, one pimple can ruin your psyche and confidence but its all relative to the person. In the last few years it started getting really bad. Cystic acne along my neck and jawline and on random areas along my face. It was to the point where I was a shut in and didn't want to be social at a the worst time in my college life. Acne sucks and it can take a lot away from you and only people who suffer or have suffered from it know how much it can effect you. 

I tried so many different routines and antibiotics. My skin would respond well to certain treatments but I always would gain confidence in a routine and stray away. It was exhausting adhering to all these different products and routines. It was also very stressful to always have to think about washing my face properly and being so anal about anything and everything revolving my routine. While I was trying different routines and products, I'd go on extremely restrictive diets for months on end to try to also figure out if that was the core issue. I would worry about every little thing that went into my body and attribute every new break out to a potential slip up in my diet. 

I've seen so many people on this sub swear by outlandish routines and a plethora of products and at the end of the day if that works for you keep doing it. I am not here to try to tell people that this is HOW its done or is the sole reason or way to get your skin under control. At the end of the day good skin is a result of a lot of things and a lot has to do with genetics. 

Anyway here is what I have learned and my thoughts on my years of suffering from chronic acne: 

Almost everyone gets a break out(s) here or there and the reaction is usually irrational. Everyone looks for a quick fix or a product that can save their skin or calm down whatever has popped up. I believe this mentality and response is what starts people down a viscous cycle of ruining their baseline skin. I think my chronic acne was self inflicted. I remember times of clear skin and when I got a break out I would introduce new products and over wash my face to try to stop the storm.  It always seemed like my original problem areas would be where the acne stemmed. 

The main culprit:  
I think your natural skin barrier plays a huge role in the state of your skin. (skin barrier is just the natural barrier of your skin comprised of oils). A healthy permeable intact barrier will help keep the bad stuff out and the good stuff in.  If you are introducing new products with actives and over-washing your face your skin barrier is suffering dearly.

If you ever feel like you hop out of the shower with a super tight and irritated skin thats a tell tale sign there are problems. It may feel good to come out the shower with a ""squeaky"" clean feel because it appears like you are washing the bad stuff off.  I do not think this is an ideal state for your skin. Think about it like this, if you are constantly over drying your skin and adding moisture back in you are confusing your natural ability to maintain and control your oils.

My routine and final thoughts. 

Fixing your skin problems takes time. Be patient if you have disrupted your natural ability to regulate your skin barrier  it will take time to fix itself. Adhere to a simple routine that you can maintain and want to maintain. It will save you money, time and stress keeping it simple. 

The meat and potatoes of your routine or even your entire routine should just be:

Wash your face with a non irritating wash or none at all (I know scary) then apply a gentle non comedogenic basic moisturizer. Once you have stuck to the basics for a substantial amount of time, I promise you your face will be less angry, less broken out and a lot easier to maintain. You will still get breakouts and it will be an uphill battle but stick with it. Consider when you start any new routine, drug or medication for your acne. These will all take just as much time and you will be dependent and stressed out thinking about what is working or not working. Once you have stuck to this routine and created a good baseline for your skin, then you can consider adding actives and other acne fighting products to your routine. 

My routine now:

Morning: Not a damn thing 

Night: 

Wash face with clean hands (just lukewarm water) in the shower. Dry face as soon as possible. 

Why? Transepidermal water loss... This is when water dries on the surface of your skin. In this process the moisture is pulled from the epidermis and evaporates. 

After: Cerave PM, Paulas Choice 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide, Neutrogena Hydro Boost (In this order) 

If you have simplified your routine and adhered to it and you still have major problems, I think this is where you can start considering more aggressive treatments and potential external factors. (Allergies, hormones, Vitamin deficiencies, gut health). One thing simplifying your routine will do is eliminate all your speculations about what works or isn't working. 

End: Hopefully this helps one person fix their issues with their skin. I can say now I can go out in public and enjoy my life again. I still have scaring and hyperpigmentation I am dealing with but it is a relief to be where I am now. Of course I still get breakouts and my skin isn't perfect, but I am happier way less stressed out about everything as a whole.

For  the past year I've noticed I have been getting acne as an adult. When I  was a teenager I had some acne but nothing too crazy. It seemed to go  away in my late teens and every now and then I would get some in my  20's.

A few months before I turned  27 I noticed I was getting acne again and predominantly around my  temples and forehead. Even if I didnt touch the blemish it would still  leave a dark mark on my skin. At first I thought it was my diet so I  started to eliminate certain foods. I eat very healthy, exercise, drink  loads of water, sleep so-so but too be fair over the past year I have  been slightly more stressed due to moving across the world back home and  getting a job in the movie industry (which is known to stressful). I  dont eat any dairy, low sugar, wash my face with sensitive face-wash,  use aloe vera and dont eat too much greasy food.

My  skin also seems to be far more oily and sweating even slightly gets my  skin super shiny and greasy. And a lot of the pimples I do get arent the  'popable' ones just big red bumps that leave a mark.

I saw a doctor to check my hormones and he said they are normal. I've booked in with a dermatologist and I'll see what they say.

Am- cleanse with acne free BP cleanser (love it)

What I need help with: I want to add something that will help with PIH, TO niacinamide had decent results but I'm pretty sure tret did most of the work. Also CeraVe sa cream burns sometimes with TO niacinamide if I don't spread it out enough maybe cause it has some acids like lactic that doesn't want to mix. But I wanna add something like alpha arbutin or azelaic acid (heard this was good) or TO hyaluronic + b5  (heard this was also good) or vitamin c but I heard that shouldn't mix with tret and I don't know how it would fit into my morning routine cuz I don't wanna get rid of niacinamide.

Don't want to get into actives or peels as I'm already using a lot of stuff. I have really oily asian skin especially the T-zone and is not sensetive.

Used water and half the the time used soap; scrubbed pretty hard for almost an hour. 


Good news? The mole seems to be gone. Bad news? I have this rash (not sure if its exactly a rash?) Its been 32 hrs at this point. I applied some petroleum jelly on it (3 times yesterday).

1,"okay, I'm probably going to book a dermatologist appt. this week. and I'm also going to go in extreme depth but I'll give a tl;dr because I'm extremely concerned, this could be a multitude of things.

tl;dr, my face turns red, super hot, and discolored and gets cystic patches of acne for like a week and then completely goes away.

longer in depth version. my skin is sensitive, dry, and acne prone, I found a routine and products that have done absolute wonders and don't irritate it or make it worse, and I've been using these products for about half a year, some longer than that. my acne has basically gone away, the texture is smoother than I thought possible, and the complexion/redness has disappeared. it feels like a miracle. HOWEVER. (and I posted this in a daily questions thread so if it sounds familiar that's why) typically like every month or so, give or take a few weeks, my skin gets a cystic break out (it's also always clustered to one place but I also get smaller pimples all over) and it doesn't correlate at all with my period, trust me, I've looked into it, and there's no connection. along with a cystic breakout, my skin turns extremely red. my neck isn't affected at all, it starts on my chin and above my jawline. and I use the EXACT same products and routine on my neck/chest. it's red as if it's extremely flushed all over, but the worst is my cheeks. and I don't wanna say it gets ""hyperpigmented"" because that tends to stay, but, my skin also gets a few shades darker, it literally looks like I have a tan, and I definitely don't bc I either just don't go outside in the sun and if I have to I wear a hat and sunscreen because I'm transparently pale. it also gets extremely hot to the touch. my whole face feels like I have a fever, not just to the touch but just sitting here it feels super hot. and I think it's just an illusion but the texture of my skin also looks bad.

so basically 4 simultaneous symptoms, redness, discoloration, acne, and heat. it happens every month(ish) or longer, and it always goes away within a week. this episode has been going on for about 3 days so far. and I've ruled so many things out.

it's not my period. it's not the products, because this predates that, I never switch them up, been using them a long time, and also apply them to my neck (my skin also looks totally fine after my skincare routine night & day during these episodes, I can even stay up like 3 or 4 hrs after my night routine and the whole time my face looks totally normal. it only happens during the day and just gets progressively worse.) it's not my pillowcase, the detergent, shampoo, cleaning products, diet, hand soap, blankets, etc. I've ruled all of that out. for a long time I thought I was just too hot, so I kept a fan on and stayed really cooled off, but it didn't make a difference. my mom suggested it might be windburn from the fan but it was happening before that. even if I keep the central AC super low it doesn't help. (but it does get WAYYY worse when the heat is on or I'm hot) I considered the fact that it was blood pressure or high heart rate, but I ruled that out as well considering I can be very relaxed and feel my pulse and it's calm, and my face is beet red. and when this isn't happening I can be extremely anxious with a high heart rate, and look normal. like I said, it's not a sunburn either, despite looking just like one. I don't go in the sun, period. my lymph nodes aren't swollen, nothing is swollen. I have no other symptoms of anything. I do work out every day for about 40 minutes and try to walk a mile every other day, but it has no correlation to that either, it makes no difference besides a very typical slightly red cheeks and sweat that only lasts about 10-15 mins after the workout whether I'm having one of these ""episodes"" or not. I also considered the possibility of it being makeup, which would be a stretch because I go through phases of zero makeup and then just eyeliner, brows, and highlight, (no foundation, no primer) and not only is highlighter the only ""face"" makeup I ever use, but it doesn't correlate at all and I use multiple brands/formulas.

I think I said this in a question thread but the ONLY thing I can think of is that it could be rosacea and these are flair ups. but from the photos I've seen of rosacea, this doesn't look like that. I don't see any blood vessels, it's just red and tan-ish. (also I think my dad had mild rosacea but his never got better or worse) every time this happens I panic and convince myself my skin is ruined and I decide to book a dermatologist apt. but it always goes away within a week and it takes a month or longer to get in with the only good dermatologist here.

the products I use are - cerave hydrating cleanser (2xdaily and this happened long before using that) kiehl's ultra facial toner (night only and I've used it for 2 yrs)  klair's vitamin c serum (every other night only and this long predates using that) cerave AM moisturizer (2xdaily and also predates that) and in the past month I incorporated the ordinary's azelaic acid chemical exfoliater, I've used it 3 or 4 times, (typically once a week and never mixed with the serum) no negative reaction, works super well, and obviously this problem predates that. my mom has also thought it's the products, but not only have I not noticed a correlation, but this predates basically all of them, they've all helped my skin like crazy, and the last few times this happened I stopped using them and slowly reincorporated them back to test for a reaction and it made no difference. it lasted a week and went away regardless.

if you need more info I'm happy to provide, I just desperately want answers or suggestions. I'm probably going to book a dermatologist apt. tomorrow and just bring in photos. also I'll edit this post later and post a photo when I can. please let me know if anyone has any ideas of what this could be or if you've ever experienced it. anything is appreciated.

11,"Hello everyone, I have a lot of trouble with cystic acne on my chin, and I recently tried a routine that actually worked for me! 

I’ve tried so many things in the past, but the only thing that every really worked was just waiting it out. Super frustrating, especially the self-restraint to not even touch it.

Yesterday I noticed another cyst forming, and started preparing myself to deal with a second chin growing out of my face for a week. However, I decided to try something different in hopes of shrinking the bump. When I woke up this morning, the bump was nearly gone!! I am so thrilled, I decided to post here for the first time! Here’s the routine I used, and I hope it’s successful for any of you too:

1. Washed my face with belif aqua bomb jelly cleanser, using my pmd clean Smart Facial Cleansing Device (I’ve had this little scrubber about 3 months, and really noticed a reduction in general congestion)
2. Exfoliated with the pmd Personal Microderm Device (I’ve only used this a couple times because I’m scared of scraping off too much, but I’ll definitely be incorporating it into my routine about once every 2 weeks from now on)
3. Put a few drops of tea tree oil mixed into water on a cotton pad, and rubbed it on the cystic acne
4. Rubbed in a few drops of Sunday Riley UFO Acne Treatment Face Oil (my skin is already oily, so this is what I use as a moisturizer when it’s hot, like it still is in Southern California) using the back side of the pmd Smart Facial Cleansing Device

I've  had regularly occuring pimples on my upper back, butt, and more  recently along the length of my spine. I think I was actually lurking  here looking for face cream reviews or something, and ended up reading a  post about bath routines. I was never particularly loyal to shower  gels, just had always used them for the convenience, and after reading  that post I picked up a bar of tumeric infused soap for $4...

I  felt a pimple on my back yesterday, which was bad news. But I then  realized it was the first one that had shown up in several months, when I  had been used to about a handful a week.

Long story short, my skin was constantly breaking out from 2016-2018, and some of the blemishes were deep and lasted a long time. I had a cystic (I believe) pimple on my chin in 2017 that took ages and ages to heal, then got another one in the same place. It finally healed, and left a small round slightly visible shiny mark- most likely a scar, but it's been there for quite some time now and hasn't faded with any of my acids over time, nothing. It stays there while my skin breaks out on occasion and heals in other areas. It only recently occurred to me that a mark like that could possibly be something worse, even though I know in my rational mind that it was a gnarly cyst and it's most likely scar tissue. The fact that it hasn't changed at all in two years is making me less worried, actually. I was stupid and messed with it the other day, and (I apologize) some clear stuff came out and it's scabby again, but it seems as though the mark itself is still there and isn't raised or red like a normal zit, which again makes me think it's scar tissue, but I tricked myself into worrying about it. Has anyone else had similar marks that never really went away from nasty zits, or should I ask a professional to look at it? Thank you!

**Texture and Smell**: 
Right away there is no strong scent to this product. Texture is pretty easy to describe as that of a light oil. This is not thick or heavy at all and is a bit runnier than some might anticipate and I find that it can easily slip and slide between my fingers as I’m massaging it into my face and it will trickle down the backs of my hands pretty fast. 
Because of this, it is very easy to spread, having a lot of ‘slip’ to it. I love this and find it perfect for extended facial massages that do not feel that I am tugging or pulling the skin in any way.
 
**Performance**: 
I’ve now gotten back into wearing makeup pretty much daily and I wear SPF 99% of the time, no matter what I am doing. Makeup can range from a very light mineral powder to liquid foundation with generous helpings of mascara on the lashes. This oil was the first one I found that actually did a number on the famous Heroine Mascara and while, lately, I have found Heroine winning once again, I can’t deny that this product does do a very good job at cleaning the bulk of it off and thus, cleaning my face well. 
In winter, I do not find I need to second cleanse with this. As I said before, it ensures there are no traces of makeup or spf left on my face and this product emulsifies and rinses off incredibly well. There is no perceptible oily residue on the skin. I say perceptible because while I can’t seem to see or feel it, I notice in Summer I do need to wash with a foaming cleanser or I am prone to a few whiteheads on my chin which could mean there is the tiniest hint of oil being left on my face which summer/high humidity me doesn’t seem to agree with? Very odd. 
I find I can get a lot of grits with this with very little pressure. This is insanely satisfying for me as it really helps me believe that this product is cleaning out my skin as deeply as it possibly can. 
Around the eyes, this is gentle and does not irritate. However, due to its slippy nature it can get between my lids and causes me a bit of blurry vision and stinging on my actual eyeball which I feel is to be expected when this happens. Don’t be like me – close your eyes tight and try not to dig your fingers all up in your lash bed and therefore all up in your eyeball.
 
**Time used**: 
I am now on my .. gosh 7th or 8th bottle of this stuff (inc refill bags as a “bottle). I’d wager the bottle lasts me roughly 3 ish months with daily use? I would also say that I am fairly generous with how much I use – almost if not 3 full pumps whereas I wager a lot of people could get by on 1.5 – 2. I think I can safely say it’s love and long term at that!
 
**Comparison of new vs old formula** 
No difference to me. Absolutely none. Everything I have written above and in my final thoughts below can be applied to both products. The only notable difference, I found on Ratzilla’s summary of it, is inclusion of more hyaluronic acid but again, I do not see anything better or worse comparing the formulas.

**Final Thoughts** 
This is an absolute holy grail product for me and you will see me recommend it often – 10/10, A+, High Distinction whatever grading rubric you prefer. I personally feel that with all the online options we have, it is available as well as being very budget friendly for cost per mL as well as how long the product actually lasts you.

i've never been the one to get forehead acne, at most it would be 1-2 pimples that would go away after several days. and this would rarely ever happen. in my teen years, i had a period of breakouts that would appear on the side of my face and it was pretty bad. my most recent struggles with pimples was about 3 years ago where i had a lot of pimples under my chin, but i think that was due to shaving without shaving cream and not properly disinfecting razors. the side and under my chin acne have all gone away however.

but now ever since June, forehead acne started happening a lot more often, i would get the 1-2 pimples, they would go away after several days, but would come back about a week or two later.

this cycle has been on repeat and is still going on now, but this time currently going through my worst breakout yet as it seems like it is only getting worse.

i have never used any products before as i would just wash my face with water every night and ever morning when i wake up; however, in July, i invested in Neutroena Pore Refining Exfoliating Cleanser because i thought it would help. i have been using this every night by wetting my face, applying it on my fingers and rubbing it in circles all over my face, specifically on my forehead and letting it rest for about 10-20 seconds before i rinse it off, with little to no help.

my current breakout started last sunday on 10/6 with two pimples on my forehead. i noticed them appear the next day on 10/7 after eating In N Out the previous day (though this never was an issue i had before). now not only are the pimples still here, but more have come to my forehead as you can see in the last picture in the link.

Hi!

I’m two weeks into epiduo. I have used this before and stopped completely back in June/July (thought I didn’t need it any longer) and was carrying on with my normal routine of TO lactic acid 5% & azelaic acid suspension PM and vitamin C & alpha arbitun AM, which are my staple. Have seriously transformed my skin! 

During the summer I was trialing TTO as a toner (stopped due to irritation) and TO squalene oil (stopped due to CCs).  

So to cut the long story, I have started using epiduo again & all these tiny bumps are coming to the surfaces, some as whiteheads or tiny blackheads, which I know is good but man if it isn’t rough :(.  Plus I have a wedding to go to next week & I’m not up for it at all. 

I’m really frustrated at myself for stopping the epiduo in the first place, but I thought since I already had an exfoliant I didn’t need it - I guess my skin relies heavily on the cream then I thought. Lesson learnt I suppose ...

## **Looking back: what we've done**

Let's start with a look back. A big project /u/scumteam14 and I undertook was updating the organisation of the sidebar and making the wiki easier to navigate. We realised that even though we have lots of good information, it might not be very easy to find - so we wanted to change that. We also made a change to make the sidebar more visible for mobile users - which is to add an Automod sticky comment on every post with a few helpful links.

Ideally, reddit would give us a better option for presenting information to mobile users, but at the moment we felt that this was the best option.

I'm definitely interested to know how people who frequent the sub often experience that sticky comment. I wonder if you get used to it, like it becomes background noise, or whether you find it intrusive and whether it negatively impacts your experience in ScA.

Another thing we did was add and train a new mod! /u/mastiii has been a very loyal and active ScA'er, being the only person to get a Helpful User badge three years in a row. I'm happy to report they're doing great as a mod :) We're planning to continue adding new mods - the more the merrier!

Let's look at the (near) future! We've had our current banner for…. I think as long as the subreddit exists? At least as long as I've known it, which is fffffive years. Oh god.

Anyway, it could definitely do with an update! Same goes for the snoo (on legacy) and the subreddit icon (on redesign/mobile).

Now, we do have a moderator with great design skills on the team, /u/sunscreenpuppy, but we thought it'd be way more fun if the banner and snoo were created by the community! Because we've already seen that we have some pretty creative skincare addicts - [looking at you](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dhg9dm/misc_i_made_a_skincare_illustration_for_day_13_of/), /u/cornpopsforever!

We'd love to get your feedback on how to organise this contest, because we'd like to make something that works, that's fun for people to participate in and that's doable.

This is our general outline: first, a brainstorming thread where everyone is welcome to share ideas (whether they end up making a design or not) and where we'll include all the details. People are free to use ideas from the brainstorming thread or come up with their own. Then a feedback thread, where people who have started their designs can share them and get feedback (totally optional). Finally a voting thread - we haven't worked out what the best way is to do this yet. And of course we'll announce the winning designs and upload them to the sub!

What I'd love to know:

* What do you think about this general setup for a design contest?
* Is there anything we could do to make it better or more approachable?
* Do you have suggestions on how to do the voting in a fair way?

## **New item: User spotlight!**

We'd like to use this opportunity to celebrate some awesome users!

The first one is looong overdue. I created a form to nominate awesome users - and then promptly forgot all about it, until we re-did the sidebar organisation. Which means I completely missed that not just one, but TWO users had nominated /u/LikesGreenTea earlier this year!

/u/emsgoo and an anonymous user both took the time to fill out the form and tell the mod team how great /u/LikesGreenTea is:

>they are an avid skincareaddiction member and answer questions with good intellect on skincare. they answer so many questions and they are just AWESOME! 

> Every time I search the subreddit for a specific issue, I find a detailed thoughtful well written comment and 90% of the time it is LikesGreenTea.

/u/LikesGreenTea: thank you so much! We're giving you an Awesome User badge :) And thank you anonymous and /u/emsgoo for your nomination!

Secondly, we have two great Sunscreen Review posts that we've added to the wiki:

* [The 10 sunscreens I've tried in my HG search! In depth reviews + swatches](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dcern5/review_the_10_sunscreens_ive_tried_in_my_hg/) by u/Ivorykiki
* [11 Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (Mega Review + Photos!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/d5x4g0/11_sunscreens_for_sensitive_skin_at_low_price/) by u/caffeinatedlackey

We really appreciate the time and effort that went into creating these helpful posts! /u/Ivorykiki and /u/caffeinatedlackey, we'll give you a Content Contributor badge to say thank you :)

Do you see anyone being awesome in the sub? [Send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSkincareAddiction&subject=&message=) and nominate them for the next User Spotlight!

## **Off topic topic: spooky stories**

/u/scumteam14 loves ghost stories, and it's almost Halloween! So share your favourite spooky stories with her in the comments :)

If you're not into ghost stories but you are celebrating Halloween, I'd love to hear how you're going to celebrate it! Are you staying home in your PJs? Sitting on the porch to scare trick-or-treaters? Working in a haunted house? Let us know!

And to get back on topic: Do you have any questions for us mods? Suggestions for the next Fireside Chat thread? Let us know :)

18,"Does anyone else have experience with their hands feeling different after their routine?

After a few weeks of my routine, my hands feel weird. It’s like there’s a dry layer of something on them. There’s a part of my left hand that has started flaking off. I guess it’s my routine? I have to touch my face with my hands to put products on. After I’m done with my sheet mask, I pour the excess liquid into my hands and rub it into my neck, chest, and hands. When I’m done moisturizing, I put the same moisturizer on my hands.

My routine is:

Evening:
1. Kose Softmyo White Cleansing Oil (wiped off right before shower)
2. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser (in shower)
3. Stridex Maximum wipes (used every other day, sometimes every two days)
4. Kikkamasamune Sake Skin Lotion Moist
5. My Beauty Diary Black Pearl Mask
6. Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream

Morning:
1. Wash face with lukewarm water
2. Apply mineral sunscreen.",1571242276.0,[Skin Concern] Does your routine affect how soft your hands are?,0.88
11,"I have a few questions about my current routine that I was hoping y'all would be able to assist with/or share your experience on.  I'm currently working with a dermatologist on my skin, but I'm feeling a little disheartened by the process.  Here's a bit of background/info on my current routine:

**Routine:**

1. I wash face with SkinCeuticals Simply Clean Cleanser, which is *fine,* but I don't think I'll repurchase because it just seems ungodly expensive for something fairly ... simple.  
2. Sometimes use a sulfur face wash prescribed by my dermatologist (\~3 times a week).  I don't have the slightest clue if it does *anything.*
3. Use Tretinoin .05% (sometimes I'll moisturize before and after the Tretinoin)
4. Use a moisturizer, which has been La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 , which I love, but have a few issues with:
   1. I go through it so fucking fast, and it only comes in a tiny tube
   2. Sometimes it like cakes up in areas so that if I touch my face, some like peels off (maybe I'm using too much?)
   3. My dermatologist isn't convinced it's the best moisturizer because it's more of a balm -- she recommended La Roche Posay Lipikar Daily Repair Moisturizing Body Lotion, which I'm convinced breaks me out.  Also, it fucking STINGS when I put it on.  My dermatologist said some stinging is fine, but it just doesn't feel right (tried also, La Roche-Posay Effaclar H Compensating Moisturizer, which I'm not sure I like either)

**So, with all of that, here are my current issues:**

1. My skin chronically peels.  It's strange, because my skin doesn't feel dry, and when it does peel, it's not raw underneath --- it's almost like skin peeling on a old sunburn.  I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn't feel like liquid fire when applied (other than Cicaplast), and that doesn't leave me a peely mess by the end of the day.
2. I'm still struggling with breakouts.  They're like tiny little pimples too - nothing super big or anything, just a lot of little, little pimples.  They're driving me crazy!  I get that Tretinoin takes time, but I'm about 3 months in and I don't see any of that glowing, lovely, ageless skin.  I know it's a process and it doesn't happen over night, but I'm feeling kind of defeated that whenever it seems like for a day or so my skin is looking better, I get like three pimples the next day in the same spots over and over.

**Also, some other details (don't know if they're helpful):**

1. My dermatologist recommended the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic serum, which I unfortunately bought.  I used it for a bit and saw no real difference.  I mainly stopped because I cannot for the life of me get past the smell.  
2. I've tried Neutrogena Hydro Boost and it seemed OK, just not enough moisture, also, it was one of the moisturizers I've tried that burned like I had just tattooed my whole face.

2,"I am a 23F and have got mild-moderate acne. 

At any one time I usually have multiple small red spots. I also have recently (past 6m) have started getting larger spots deeper under the skin that take weeks to go. 

I have tried a range of products, and have used each for at least 6 weeks to see if they work: 
- Duac cream 
- Tea tree collection (Body shop) (Caused lots of clogging and more cystic acne) 
- Soap & water (very drying but no massive spots) 
- Micellar Water and Rinseing (no massive spots but no clear skin) 
- A large selection of acne cleansers etc from the shop

I recently tried using acnecide, as when I was 18 I used this and it successfully cleared my skin for a while. I used La Roche Posay Effaclar H moisturiser afterwards. 

I started using it Saturday, and I have developed lots of small red spots and tiny whiteheads around my chin and cheeks. On my cheek bone area, I have developed very red patches which are very rough/bumpy- these are not spots but the texture is visible and it is sore. 

I’ve since discontinued using, but my skin is in the worst state it has been this year and the new rough texture on my cheek bones is getting me down just as much as all the new spots. 

Does anyone have any tips on healing this rough skin? Or has this happened to anyone else? 

I am going to visit the GP next week to try and tackle this once and for all, but not feeling hopeful as the last time I went I was brushed off. Has anyone managed to deal with a GP who wasn’t interested?",1571239768.0,[Acne] Tiny dots/rough skin after Acnecide and La Roche Posay,1.0
26,"When choosing a moisturizer, the first question you need to ask is: What do I need specifically, an emollient or a humectant?

**Emollients** are used to soften and smooth the scales of the skin, which help reduce rough, flaky skin. Unlike humectants that attract moisture, emollients create a guarding film in order to trap it. Emollients are typically used to protect skin cells and help regulate skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and ichthyosis by preventing scaly patches, itchiness, and flare-ups.

**Humectants** typically draw water to the skin from two different places; they can draw water from a humid environment, and they enhance water absorption from the outer layer of the skin.

**+ Occlusives**: Occlusive ingredients create a physical barrier helping to trap moisture in the skin. Moisture can’t escape very well, nor can it penetrate this barrier. Other occlusive ingredients include wax, dimethicone (or any ingredient ending in “cone”). Occlusives work in tandem with humectants and emollients to help keep the skin hydrated, soft, and glowing by preventing trans-epidermal water loss (aka TEWL.) This is achieved due to an additional barrier against the skin that locks in moisture—but it doesn’t increase it.

If you have a **Dry skin** type and you consider yourself to be hydrated, you should focus on a good emollient to lock-in the moisture in your skin barrier and prevent patches, eczema or itchiness.

If you have **any skin type** but suffer from dehydration you would need the three of them present in your moisturizer.

Some good **humectants** to look out for in a moisturizer are Beta-glucan, Yeast Extract (one-of-the-best), Aloe, Honey, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Red algae, Allantoin.

Good **Emollients** include Lanolin(best, in my opinion), Squalane, Shea butter, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, any oils high in linoleic acids. I would refrain from using emollients such as Mineral oil, Petrolatum or Paraffin as they were reported to be **potentially** damaging to the skin in the long-term. It all depends on your skin reactiveness, some people love mineral oil, and some not. Pay attention to how your skin reacts to these ingredients. 

In terms of **occlusives,** most plant oils are considered emollients, but some oils, particularly those high in oleic acid, also have occlusive properties. Lecithin, and Cocoa Butter work wonders as occlusives. You can find Dimethicone as one of the preferred occlusives in most moisturizers, but some people with sensitive skin have reported reactions to it.

**A good moisturizer for water loss:** Biologique Recherche Hydravit's (excellent humectant quality and formula).

**A good moisturizer for dry skin:** Drunk Elephant Lala Retro (emollient-focused formula).

*****Disclaimer: The two products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a moisturizer and I thought I could share my experience because I have spent some serious money on products that simply didn’t do the job.*****

I have sensitive, combo skin in which my T zone gets oily part way through the day. I have been moderately acne prone since I was a teenager. Back then, I tried all kinds of harsh acne treatments, wore a ton of makeup, and went tanning. Over time, I stopped most of the acne products and quit tanning. I also (within the past year or so) stopped wearing makeup on my skin (only eye makeup). Although it is much better than it was, I do still have some mild skin issues I would like to straighten out.

I have some CCs, OCs, and sometimes get small pustules or papules. I also have uneven texture and some mild pigmentation from acne scars. Up until the past month or two, I generally just took my eye makeup off with micellar water and washed my face with just water (I had previously done OCM, but got lazy). I also didn't use moisturizer or sunscreen (I know).

My current routine is:

AM: Gently wash with water, mist face with rosewater, apply CeraVe Daily Moisturizing lotion, Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Sunscreen 50 SPF (just added to routine this week)

PM: OCM with hemp seed oil, swipe with Garnier micellar water for second cleanse, rinse with plain water after micellar water, swipe with Thayer's Unscented Alcohol Free Witch Hazel, mist face with rosewater, apply Cerave Daily Moisturizing lotion

4,"Hello, SCA!

I would love your help. I read thing a lot but still think I need some help. I have pretty okay skin. I have a small patch of eczema every now and again but I’m overall happy with my skin with one exception: closed comedones and hyperpigmentation. 

I have PIH and use a pretty solid routine that has improved it! My closed comedones, however, remain unchanged. I feel them right under the surface of the skin on my forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw. If I look very close, I can see them. But they aren’t glaringly obvious. 

If I’m so inclined to clear a pore, a squiggly line of pus comes out or a thicker white pus (sorry, TMI). More often or not, they’re stuck and I don’t feel like picking anyway. I think these may also be sebaceous filaments. 

My routine is as follows:

AM:
- rinse face with warm water
- tone (Benton Aloe BHA toner)
- serum (TO alpha arbutin + HA)
- moisturize (Biossance squalane + omega repair cream)
- oil (Biossance vitamin c + rose oil)
- sunscreen (Skin & Lab Fre-Sun Lotion SPF 50+ PA++++)

PM:
- double cleanse (DHC deep cleansing oil)
- cleanse (Dr. Jart dermaclear micro gel cleanser)
- tone (Benton Aloe BHA toner)
- serum (TO alpha arbutin + HA)
- moisturize (Biossance squalane + omega repair cream)
- oil (Biossance vitamin c + rose oil)

I usually use a chemical exfoliant (nip and fab glycolic instant fix extreme 5% glycolic acid) 1-2x a week but I switched for using good genes lactic acid treatment for two days and my skin became very itchy and dry. I haven’t exfoliated since then. 

I feel like my routine could be better and I’m not sure where to make the improvement for my closed comedones. I want to start getting facials, but want can I do preventatively on my own?

I have dry skin other places and originally thought that was the problem, but my face is never flaky like my other skin is so maybe this is something different?

I have been experimenting with my routine but nothing seems to have much effect on the tightness. I tried heavier moisturizer and a sleeping masking but that had no noticeable effect.

2,"I have a habit of doing too little research and buying products that I don't test or give my face time to adapt to. Years ago when I first got into skin care, I decided that I have combination dry skin and bought Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and Cerave Facial Moisturizer. I pretty much only used those two twice a day, AM and PM, and my skin was... fine. Not great, not terrible. I wanted to fix my SF and I got blind pimples once every couple of weeks.

Recently, I decided to do something about it. I have Ponds Anti-Wrinkle Rejuveness Cream, so I started using that a couple of times a week (with sunscreen, of course). At the same time, I started wetshaving because I've been developing ingrown hairs and I needed a new razor anyway. That caused irritation and bumps, probably a combination of bad technique and bad reaction to the shaving soap. To combat that, I bought myself red box Stridex. Why? Because I decided that I actually have combination seasonal skin. So a cheap BHA like that would probably help balance my oil production and heal the razor bumps.

I've since stopped the AHA and switched to a soap that's better for sensitive skin. But now I have PIH and the razor bumps seem to be getting worse. I can't tell if they're healing or not. My routine recently:

AM:
No cleanser. I leave my house, hit the gym, shower, moisturize with Cerave Facial Moisturizer, then head to work. I do this because I don't want to cleanse/moisturize at home, work out, shower, and moisturize again. Or maybe I should do that? 

PM: 
Cerave Hydrating Cleanser
Stridex if I don't shave. If I shave, I use an alum block. 
Wait 25 min
Cerave Facial Moisturizer 

My hunch is to stop shaving and stick with a simple cleanse/moisturize daily until the razor bumps heal. And then after, I can address my PIH and SF concerns. Does that sound about right? Or is there something else I can do to bring my skin back to the ""not great, not terrible"" days?",1571184430.0,[Routine Help] I tried to do too many things at once.

 [This photo was taken 30 mins after showering](https://imgur.com/a/oq8wtXW)

I have been on acne.org  for two years now and it kept my face acne free for 93% of the time. (I guess this is where I got my dehydration from, benzoyl peroxide)

I've been trying to fix my oily skin by cleansing using oily skin cleansers,  applying oils like rosehip, jojoba using a matte moisturizer and such throughout the years but it seems that my skin is a capital of oil production.

Recently I found out that I have dehydrated skin so I began trying to fix that as well. I added in Vita B5 Toner and Cerave Hydrating moisturizer to help restore my moisture barrier on top of my Acne.org Regimen. I started breaking out, and little bumps, especially near my jawline, started coming out of nowhere, I don't know what they are, but they seem like the can grow as an acne/pimple.

So I stopped using vita b5 toner because of the breakout, Went back to my normal routine, acne.org and it cleared it again but it took two weeks or so. 

Fast forward to last week, I swapped my moisturizer to Cerave Hydrating Moisturizer, it was good for 3 days then my breakout and bumps started coming back. 

 [This is my skin now, you can see the little bumps and the breakout.](https://imgur.com/a/qJzN4PA)

Benzoyl peroxide is amazing, It's the only thing that I have tried that has kept me acne clear. However, I don't know if this is 100% correct but it's probably what caused my dehydration. I don't want to stop using it because the moment I do, I start breaking out. When I break out it leaves PIH that stays for a couple of months. Nothing works for my oily skin either, I do use a Matte moisturizer on top of my regular moisturizer but that only lasts an hour or so before the oil penetrates through it. 

I don't know if I should just keep my skin dehydrated so I don't break out or not. 

At this point, I'm convinced that every time I apply hydrating products or whenever my skin is actually hydrated, I break out.

I recently tried out Wow You! Super Serum, and I really think it’s working— using that in combination with COSRX Galactomyces 95 Tone Balancing Essence has legit saved my skin, I’ve broken out hardly even once in the past 2 months.

I’m thinking of checking out more Wow You! products, but the only reviews I can find are a handful of sponsored blogs. Anyone else have experience with this brand? And if so— what do you think?

Kind of a complicated issue.

When I was 16-18 I had acne and self treated it like an idiot. I used way too much benzoyl peroxide and my face was really red and dry. Didn't use a moisturizer at all.

It was fully peeling and very stingy but I suckered through. It was like 6 months if messing up my skin with BP.

I then weaned off it and just did gentle cleansing.
I eventually incorporated cleansing and moisturizing, and have been consistent for 6 years.
However, my skin is still red and looks messed up.

I am wondering if the long period of excessive dryness and irritation depleted a vitamin or collagen or something in my skin.

Is that possible, and is there something that can help beyond having moisturized and used extra gentle products for 6 years?

I ordered niacinamide 10% and will look for Vitamin C as a start.

I've been tweaking my routine for a while and I'm not sure if I'm purging or just haven't found the right product yet and started to break out.

I always had naturally really clear skin, didn't have to worry about it nearly at all. Then last December BOOM break out of closed comedones and clogged pores. Full panic mode.

I had a sample of Clearly Correctiv Brightening & Smoothing Moisture Treatment that worked but I thought it was WAAAAY to expensive, went to Deciem with a product list and they helped me build a routine. This was last feb. It worked beautifully, I used the khiels serum when break outs were getting worse (normally around period). And then BOOM around 2 months ago same break out of clogged pores and closed comedones returned. The're around my chin, jawline, hairline and inner cheekbones and before anyone says, I'm super careful to remove ALL make-up.

I thought it might be over-exfoliation, so I cut down my routine to basics and gave it around 5 weeks and nothing changed, if anything I suddenly got white super-irritated white-heads. Ok cool, slowly added back other aspects of my routine but nothing helped. Used Khiels as the only active and it improved things but not 100%.

It was always normal for some pimples to appear about a week before my period, but it would be just a few of them and they would go away pretty soon until the next period. However, it is much worse now - it's sudden and the pimples hurt and itch a lot.

My only guess would be the change in weather (I live in Finland and winter is coming), but it never really happened before. I use very small amount of dairy, nothing much changed in my diet over the past months, I change my pillow sheets regularly, I am always well hydrated and the only change in my routine was that I started to use toner. I have oily skin type and also history of severe acne during my teenage years.

Does anyone have a clue why this is suddenly happening? Also any tips for better skincare routine would be appreciated!

A month ago, I went to the derm asking for doxycycline (I’ve used it before and it worked wonders). She told me I may also benefit from spiro but I wanted to try the doxycycline first. Well I am a month in and I know sometimes it takes 2-3 months but I’m still breaking out and I’m at the end of my rope and am planning to ask for spiro tomorrow at my appt. My question is: how long did spiro take for you all to see a difference in your skin? I am hoping with the combination of doxycycline, I’m taking it for 3 mos, and spiro that my skin will start improving within the month. But I just wanted to ask I guess if that was realistic?

I typically have hormonal acne on my cheeks, jawline and now chin, which can sometimes (probably more often than not) be cystic. This is something new and I’m not sure if it’s my new routine or my age...ugh. I’m also sensitive to silicones, making moisturizer very difficult to shop for. 

I took the plunge and started revamping my routine, slowly replacing my Proactiv products with other products while still trying to address my skin issues.

I've been struggling with acne for three years now. After seeing a dermatologist last summer, I was on antibiotics and epiduo (adapalene 0.1%, benzoyl peroxide 2.5%): my skin got way better! But now that my treatment ended, my skin got worse and I got a lot of breakouts..

Since I couldn't go see another dermatologist, I've decided to give Dermatica (UK version of Curology) a try! I've been prescribed with adapalene, niacinamide & clindamycin. I'm supposed to receive my order this week but I'm really scared of purging as I heard that it's really common to happen especially when using adapalene.. Given the fact that having a few spots makes me feel so low, I can't imagine how low I'll feel when I'm going to be purging :(((

I've also ordered a few more products that I'll be trying out as I suspect I have fungal acne lol so my skin routine will more or less look like this:

AM:
- Splash my face with water
- Klair Unscented toner
- Benton Aloe Propolis soothing gel
- Purito Centella Green level safe sun

PM:
- Purito Defence Barrier pH cleanser
- Klairs unscented toner
- Dermatica (adapalene, niacinamide, clindamycin) 
- after 20 minutes, Benton Aloe Propolis soothing gel

2,"Never done a product review before, so apologies if this isn't sufficient. But please feel free to ask questions...

So I've been on the lookout for a gel lotion for AM and PM use that can really help rebuild my moisture barrier on my cheeks due to increasing usage of retinol. Researched on this forum and on r/AsianBeauty, but all the products that I wanted to try aren't available in country (or via a legit source without costing an arm/leg on shipping). I purchased this out of impulse since I was really gearing towards a Japanese or Western product.

Atopalm is a Korean skincare brand that uses patented (or will be so?) MLE technology that supposedly mimics or help with your existing moisture barrier. I'm probably not explaining this right, so please do your googling to understand their brand better. Their Soothing Gel Lotion is  baby-friendly, and applicable on face and body. I'm not sure what the ingredients are since everything is in Korean. I read that to amplify the soothing effect, you can store this in the fridge as well. But this isn't a product that *needs* to be stored in a fridge.

**MY SKIN TYPE:** combo skin. Normal T-zone (though currently have and prone to SFs on nose and chin) and dry, sensitive cheeks. A couple of acne whenever hormonal cycle is approaching. Ancient acne blemishes, sun spots and a couple of old (now purple) broken capillaries on cheeks. No scars. Rosacea just under the nose.

**CURRENT SKINCARE ROUTINE:** (sorry, it's more elaborate than I would like as I am trying to finish a lot of products that I had purchased out of greed)

**Morning** \- wash face with water only > Inkey List BHA on nose and chin > Hada Labo Gokuyjun Hyaluronic Acid toner > Hada Labo Hydrating Essence on forehead and cheeks (I don't think it's  really doing anything to my skin, simply trying to use this up) > Sana Namerakahonpo Plumping Eye cream > The Ordinary's Squalane Oil on nose and chin > Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion > Anessa Perfect UV sunscreen mild milk

**Night** \- Shu Uemura Ultim8te cleansing oil, followed by Hada Labo Cleansing foam wash > *insert Pixi Glow Tonic once a week* \> Hada Labo Gokuyjun Hyaluronic Acid toner > Hada Labo Hydrating Essence on forehead and cheeks (I don't think it's  really doing anything to my skin, simply trying to use this up) > Sana Namerakahonpo Plumping Eye cream > *Insert The Ordinary's Retinol 0.5% in Squalane alternating nights and not using Pixi Glow Tonic* \> Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion *(mixed in with The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid on days without Pixi Glow Tonic and TO's retinol)*

**PRODUCT THOUGHTS:** Didn't have any high hopes, but was pleasantly surprised!

**Texture and finish -** like a lotion. Most of it sinks in quite quickly like a gel. I don't use a lot of it - I would say about a US 10 cent coin amount for night time. Day time, slightly less. It has a bit of a sticky finish at first, but my skin feels sufficiently hydrated and protected when it's fully absorbed. It goes under my sunscreen and liquid foundation nicely.

**Scent -** there's a faint pleasant smell. Not overwhelming at all and it goes away rather quickly. No medicinal smell or the kind you get when you buy fragrance-free skincare products. Presumably it has fragrance and/or essential oil in it, though again I cannot confirm as I don't speak Korean.

**How my skin feels after 3 days of usage -** it feels pretty resilient! I've used it as my last step for 1 retinol night routine and 1 Pixi Glow Tonic night routine, as well as with TO's Azelaic Acid mixed into it for another night. Also used it as a morning moisturiser. No breakouts or any clogged pores on areas that I applied (forehead and cheeks). I have started even applying it down my neck/decollete as well, and will be using it as my body moisturizer when I travel. I don't find it soothing in the obvious sense - say, if I was applying an aloe vera gel - but it also could be because I don't have severe damage on my skin and I haven't stored it in the fridge.

Before stumbling upon Atopalm, the most recent moisturizers I tried are:

\- Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Light Cream (pink tub) - nice basic hydrating cream. But my moisture barrier took longer to heal with this product than the Atopalm. It also was too heavy for my nose and chin and caused my pores to clogged up.

\- Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Water gel - did not feel hydrated whatsoever, or that my moisture barrier was improving. Very strong alcohol scent.

I find that  Atopalm is equally, if not more hydrating, than these products. But Atopalm definitely made my skin feel the strongest. I'm still in the process of keeping SFs under control on my nose and chin, but I will be applying Atopalm on those areas once they are.

If you are struggling to find a light moisturizer that you can use in the AM and PM, the ingredient list is acceptable, don't mind waiting more than a few minutes for the product to dry, or looking for a moisturizer for both face and body for travelling, I would highly recommend you give this a go :)

That’s not super long when you consider how it takes 2 months between check-ins for the meds to take effect. 
But my dermatologist seemed somewhat surprised and frustrated that my skin didn’t improve as much as hoped by now and seemed to be running out of ideas...

I recently had to take a break because recent life changes (moving out and getting new jobs) created enough financial strain that I decided to temporarily stop treatment.

25,"So since I've joined this sub Ive seen a crap ton of questions from people with acne. Ive also seen what appears to be a lot of mistakes in their routine.

So heres some advice no one directly asked me for, but I hope it is helpful. I would also encourage others to share their skincare secrets on this post.

1) Stick to up to 3 products for day and up to 3 products for night time. 1 cleanser, 1 acid (if you are into that), 1 serum/ moisturizer. More than that and you will likely clog your pores. I add a tea tree mask when my skin is being fussy

2) Using products that are too harsh for your skin can cause / worsen inflammation / acne.  Sometimes your acne is your skin reacting to you shooting flame throwers (multiple acids) at it. Soothing products like aloe can offer some relief.

3) You are what you eat...and drink. No matter what any derm says, its been my experience that excess sugar and fat can reek havoc on the skin. When this happens to me, I do a soup fast along with only drinking plain water, lemon water, and tea (artificial sweetner) for at least a week. I slowly add foods back after my skin has cleared up. This allows me to identify the trigger food(s) and any commonalities among them. I never really ban anything, but I do limit the triggers.

4) Supplements: Some supplements detox your body and can express in your skin via bumps. Research any supplements/ vitamins that you are taking. If they are known for causing bumps, you may need to lower your dosage for a while OR up your water intake.

5) Try supplements that are purported to improve your skin. May require some trial and error. I'm currently playing around with a supplement that is quite expensive, but so far it actually works pretty well.

6) Exercise. It just makes your body function better. I focus more intensely on exercise during my fast because I am trying to rid myself of toxins and hormonal imbalances.

7) Tea Tree oil. Periodt. Its anti-fungal.

8) If all else fails, take the money youve been spending on cream after cream and try a GOOD dermatologists.",1571109359.0,[ACNE] UNSOLICITED ADVICE BASED ON RECENT POSTS. Hope this helps!,0.25

This has happened twice in my life.

I  had a random bout of acne that lasted MONTHS on my face (my cheeks and  jaw). It never happened before on those areas. It happened right after I  got my face threaded. I tried everything I normally used - AHAs, BHAs,  Vitamin C, masks, etc. Nothing worked. I went to a dermatologist, and  she prescribed me a topical antibiotic with some benzoyl peroxide - my  acne took about 1-2 months to clear up and not come back. Then I used my  regular AHAs to clear away the scars.

My skin was clear for a few more years... and then it happened again.

It  started breaking out on my chin and cheeks. I couldn't figure out how  to get rid of it. Sulfur ointment didn't work (thought it was fungal),  tried my usual BHAs, swapping out all my usual skincare to isolate the  problem, not using anything. I did this for half a year. Then I tried  using benzoyl peroxide, by itself (with moisturizer), for about 1-2  months, and it completely cleared my acne. The spots, the breakouts -  it's all stopped. I think the reason is that when you have a bacterial  infection on your face, it needs to be treated first.

Anyway  - if you're struggling, please give BP a try! Look up short-contact BP  to make it easier on your skin - basically apply a thin layer for 1 min,  rinse it off. I did this once a day for a week or two, then twice a day  for another few weeks, then started leaving the thin layer on during  the night.

Hello everyone,

I'm currently concerned about how much texture I got and specifically on my forehead.

&#x200B;

My skin is oily and acne-prone and I have been changing my skincare routine quite a lot these past weeks.

 I've used Accutane in the past (treatment for acne) for 9 months and stopped using taking it 1.5 years ago which worked wonderfully. Since then, my skin has gotten worse.

It's not like it's the worst, I don't get those big pimples, but I don't like how much texture I got and I'm afraid I over exfoliate my skin or just doing something wrong? Might be using too much products? Every ideas are appreciated.

One issue currently is I do not use a sunscreen at the time, because I ordered Krave The Beet Shield, but it's taking a lot of time to arrive and I don't like using other sunscreens because my skin gets so oily (this might be the problem) :/

6,"Over the years I've tried a bunch of different products and honestly, only a select few made visible and positive improvement to my skin. I guess I'm curious to learn what other products worked well for my fellow skincare addicts lol. Please note, I like products that work really fast! 


The most important change I made to my improve the health of my skin was eliminating diary as much as possible.  No milk or cheese, took care of my cystic acne problem completely.  But on to the products.  


Being someone who is acne prone,  BHA is critical for me and I've tried many that didn't do anything for my skin.  

The most effective product in this category is Paula's Choice 4% BHA. You will see results after the first use, clearer and smoother skin. I've never had a pimple it couldn't destroy after two usage.  It's like magic.  I recently used her 9% BHA and saw great results as well but it's more of a spot treatment.  


Another issue I encountered over the years is dullness.  Dark spots etc and I must say I've tried a few vitamin C products but I didn't see any amazing change until I started using Olehenriksen Truth Serum and C Rush Gel creme. My favourite routine is to layer Truth serum, then PC's 4% BHA and top it off with the C Rush Gel creme.  This combo is guaranteed to produce frighteningly clear and smooth face the following morning.  As a guy, I don't like using this combo too often as it makes my skin looks too smooth and flawless.   


The most challenging category to find a  product capable of visually improving your skin is definitely the moisturizer category. Honestly, they generally don't do anything for my skin. My skin type combination and I get oily quickly, like needing a blotting paper oily.  lol Getting a moisturizer capable of just giving me a normal look was a challenge.  

The most effective moisturizer in terms of making your skin look renewed, younger, and litreally change the texture of your skin is drunk elephant's Protini. In Toronto, this is litreally over $100 after taxes which means,   it's not a product I get to use as often as I would like (like I always go around trying alternatives and they're no good), but whenever I use it, it makes me look 5 years younger after a week or two of consistent use.  I've litreally had a 6'1 tall extremely beautiful young lady randomly approached me inside a club and told me I was ""beautiful"" because of this moisturizer, it just makes you look your best lol. Actually dated her for a little while lol 

Caveat,  it can cause some reaction like white heads, I feel like it's purging with those signal peptides. Use BHA and continue using because after awhile your skin stop reacting.  


Another category I've tried a bunch of products in is the cleanser category. I've used many drying cleansers that just strip my skin and made it tight.  The ordinary oil cleanser has been a revelation for me as it really cleans my face post gym etc but instead of my face feeling tight it's actually moisturized and soft.  Try an oil cleanser, this one is great tho.


Lastly I'd like to discuss Masks, the most effective for having clearer skin for me has been NIOD Myrrh clay. Whenever I want to just to give my skin a deep and immediate clean, I go for this one.  It takes ten years off lol

For reference, I am under 25, have combination (but more oily skin) which is relatively clear from spots, however I do have clogged pores/faint blackheads mainly on my nose but sparsely in other areas too. I also have quite large pores on my nose and cheeks.

4,"So I just ran out of cotton pads and had to do my morning skincare routine without cotton pads. No big deal, right? Wrong.

Let me explain how I use cotton pads. In the mornings I use Niacinamide and peptides. As I'm sure everyone knows, peptides have penetration issues. They have to penetrate to the living skin layers to be effective.

To make sure my peptides are penetrating, I make sure my skin is sufficiently exfoliated at all times. I use high concentration Tretinoin every other day, and a 30% Glycolic Acid peel once a month. I also wash my face in the morning with a foaming cleanser to make sure my skin is completely clean and bare.

In addition to these things, I like to apply my First Treatment Essence on a cotton pad. FTEs themselves are supposed to enhance penetration of the following products. The cotton pad adds just a touch of physical exfoliation immediately preceding peptide application. 

So currently I'm on a hunt for the best cotton pads on the market. I'm pretty picky, I need them to be big, at least 2 inches, thick, soft while still providing some texture/friction to exfoliate slightly.

I am going to a 3-day music festival where I will be camping in a tent with some friends. There will be limited access to running water. I have extremely acne-prone skin and have had acne since I was 11 (23, F), and I am still in the middle of treating a really bad breakout that started around March of this year. My skin type is oily and acne-prone. My current routine is as follows:

AM:

\-Wash face with Cetaphil oily skin cleanser

\-Differin moisturizer with SPF 30

\-BB cream on scars/zits

PM:

\-Wash face with Cetaphil oily skin cleanser

\-Clindamycin  1% cream

\-Tretinoin 0.025% (dilute with moisturizer if skin is feeling extra sensitive/dry)

I am wondering how I should continue to treat my acne while I am camping. It will be difficult for me to follow my normal routine above due to the limited amount of water, but I want to continue treating my skin for those three days, especially since my skin is very oily and will probably get pretty dirty at the festival.

6,"Hey folks! So the past year, I have gone through several different routines (always for several months at a time) trying to deal with a nasty breakout that started summer before last and just. wouldn’t. end.

This sub gave me a lot of great information and I was careful to use gentle products like CeraVe, Eucerin, and argan oil, and when I used benzoyl peroxide I only did short contact therapy every 2-3 days. I saw a massive improvement with the BP, but my skin was still so much worse than it had been two years ago when I had basically no routine.

And then about six weeks ago I just ran out of energy and stopped using most of my products.

My current routine is something like this:

&#x200B;

AM: 

Wash with water

Skinoren 20% azelaic acid

Nivea Sun Sensitive SPF50

&#x200B;

PM:

Wash with water… or don’t wash at all, if I'm feeling particularly lazy.

&#x200B;

My skin is now looking better than it has for the past year. My acne is mostly hormonal, so I know there’s a limit to how much topical treatments will help, and I’m at peace with that. After a year of having at least 5-6 active cystic pimples on my face all month, I can deal with 2-4 small ones for a week around my period. It’s annoying, but I now know how much worse it can be!

I suspect that actually, my skin just doesn’t need all that much help. Not using a cleanser or moisturiser seems to be a good option for me when I’m not wearing makeup.

So I used to have fairly bad hormonal acne a few years ago, mostly due to puberty and lack of a solid routine(aka moisturizer lol, thanks dad). After stumbling upon this sub, I got some Cerave products and TO products and I had clear skin! Hallelujah! I still got the hormonal breakouts on the chin once and a while, but I felt freaking good and so confident! 

Flash forward to this summer, I decided to dabble more into the asian beauty world, specifically sunscreen. I got the popular Biore Watery Essence and the Centella Safe Sun, but unfortunately the Centella ended up breaking me out (pretty sure I’m sensitive to niacinamide or something). I thought the Biore worked, but I highly suspect the high alcohol content could’ve triggered the fungal acne that was just waiting to crop up again (looking back, I’m pretty sure it was rather severe during my high school days). Add to that the humidity of summer, the stress from school starting, bad eating habits and boom, my face was breaking out and itchy. And it literally hasn’t let up since then (the itch is mostly gone though thank goodness!). 

I stopping everything and went back to the basics with my Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and the Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion, but then... it got worse! So I put back the Stridex, and it worked a little. This weekend I think all the spots were starting to clear up, but unfortunately I made the biggest noob mistake. I’d been putting a lot of actives on my face trying to just get rid of all the acne, but as we all know that’s never a good plan. I feel like my skin’s biting back lol, so here I am again with angry skin ready to burst with new breakouts. 

*sigh* I’ll definitely lay off the actives, but jeez I just want this whole acne period to end already, preferably soon since I have an interview on Wednesday🙏🙏 Wouldn’t it be so nice if our skin didn’t always decide to be a jerk the one day we desperately need it to chill?? Lol and as insecure as this sounds, it sucks having had bad skin for so long, then finally getting to clear up, only for the acne to return once again.

I came across this article: [https://www.oumere.com/blogs/news/the-3-reasons-why-vitamin-c-serums-are-bad-for-your-skin](https://www.oumere.com/blogs/news/the-3-reasons-why-vitamin-c-serums-are-bad-for-your-skin) and it's making me panic. The writer seems to imply that our bodies have a finite amount of collagen etc and that using something like a Vitamin C serum to increase the renewal of our skin will actually age us faster, because our bodies will then stop producing collagen a lot faster. There's also a lot about something called the Fenton reaction and that Vitamin C is a 'pro-oxidant' that will react with other chemicals to oxidise on our skin and damage it, but to be honest, I didn't really understand a lot of that.

I also take a collagen supplement, along with using Vitamin C serum as my only 'active' (at the moment), but now I'm freaked out that I'm going to run out of collagen and my skin will age more rapidly and poorly as a result.

I always breakout from stress and PMS which has lead me to have little pimples, red marks from touching them and acne scars from before that I want to get rid of.

I hear AHA/BHA is good for getting rid of those things so I tried the Cosrx BHA blackhead power liquid and it broke me out so I'm reluctant and hesitant to go back.

I’ve had severe closed comedones on my face (forehead, cheeks, and jawline) for a few months, so the doctor recently prescribed me with Finacea 15% gel. I started using it last week and I use it everyday during the morning and evening. I’m not the most knowledgeable about skincare, so was wondering if I could get advice about my routine and the order of using products.

For both morning and evening, this is my routine:
- Cleanse with Cetaphil 
- Apply Paula’s Choice 2% BHA
- Apply Finacea
- Apply moisturizer 
- Apply sunscreen (just for the morning)

I’m confused about the order and wait time between using the above products. Should I use the BHA before or after the Finacea? And when should I use the moisturizer? I’ve noticed that in the one week I’ve used Finacea that the skin around my mouth and nose is red and painful.

Are there any other products I can introduce in my current routine to help with the stubborn closed comedones? I’ve heard a lot about The Ordinary’s products and was wondering if I can use something from their line along with Finacea.

20,"Last I posted here I started to get into a nice routine to combat my eczema. Things have changed.

Last winter I developed Nummular Eczema. It started on my neck and face but it has now spread to my arms, feet and upper lip area. The worst being my hands. Thankfully it does not cover my entire face like it used to. 

It used to flare up for about a week but then go down for 2-3 weeks. It has been in constant flare up mode since July. Some days the redness goes away, but the dryness and flakes are still present. 

Using soaps (unscented or scented) on my hands trigger it, as well as shampoos, body washes, sunscreen, makeup, most lotions etc. I cut out all of these items and it went away almost completely. But I work with animals and i have to wash my hands frequently, I also feel really gross after not using soap and I don’t want to get sick or get other people or my animals sick.

I’ve run out of things to try and combat this. I’ve visited the dermatologist & a normal doctor and all they can give me is steroid creams for temporary use. It’s been mostly just a band-aid solution. I would love some advice from some other eczema sufferers here. I’d love to find someone else with Nummular eczema I could talk to.

Things I’ve tried...
- Vanicream (the only thing that semi helps dryness)
- Oatmeal soaks, oatmeal masks
- Coconut oil, Shea butter, olive oil
- Facial oil
- Sleeping in a ski mask (lol)
- Going vegan
- Taking fish oil and other vitamins
- Probiotics
- Moist wound dressings
- Eucerin (made me flare up), CeraVe (a bit better but still makes me flare up on occasion), Ponds (flare up) Aveeno
- Aloe Vera (worst flare up of all time)
- Apple cider vinegar
- Essential oils (flare up city!!)
- Drinking loads more water
- Vaseline or Aquaphor (flare up)
- Allergy meds 
- Most eczema marketed products at drug stores

I've gone on 2 dates where 1 girl has asked me ""Do you get out into the sun?"", and another ""You look like you have the kind of skin that will tan easily."" She's right. I can go out in the sun for 1 hour and come back looking Peurto Rican. 

I hate how pale and sick my skin looks. I've always had a tan my whole life. I worked on cruise ships for years and used to lay out in the sun. I look much, much better with a bit of a tan.  On the other hand I'm terrified of aggravating my melasma again. My natural skin tone is weird. It's not pale, but it's not tan either. It tends to take on the light of wherever I am.

I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Maybe it's better to have some melasma and a tan, than to look pale and have some mild melasma. I realize tanning ages you, but dudes...I'm 38 and single after being married for 8 years. When I'm 60, no one is going to want to sleep with me anyways. So I'll have some more wrinkles.

I've asked my dermatologists about this and of course they can only see you as a medical condition. They can't ethically tell you ""go get a tan"", even if in their heart they think I would look better with one.

Is anyone else in this position? Sometimes I think about going and tanning but absolutely smothering the melasma-prone areas of my skin with sunscreen. I started to use all that fancy skin-nerd stuff, Retin-A, niacinamide, vitamin-C serum. I suppose I have to stop all that stuff.

2,"Hello everyone!

So this past February, I had a change in my living situation and moved from one town to another.

Since I made the move, my skin has not been in its best condition to say the least.

Note:  I used to have pretty bad acne when I was younger - up until 21 when I started taking antibiotics.

Here's what has changed in my living situation:

1. I moved from a clean town (at least, no big pollution sources) to a town in which I live like 10 minutes from an oil refinery.
2. I had to move in with my grandmother to take care of her.  She is a HEAVY chain smoke and smokes in the house.  I work from home.. thus resulting in me being around second hand smoke all day everyday. 
3. She's also not the cleanest person in the world either.  (I'll clean the house spotless and give it two days, voila we're back to a mess).

Since I made the move, my skin has been in crap condition and it seemingly started when these factors had changed.  I now have more acne than I've had in years, my skin is EXTREMELY blotchy, red and now super dry in some areas, which was never an issue before I moved.

I've tried to weed out external factors such as diet, etc but I'll be honest.. my diet has always included dairy, gluten and I used to eat a lot of sugar.  However, I've since removed soda from my diet entirely, drink my fair share of water in a day, and I rarely consume sugar except for the occasional indulgence. 

Can these factors have an effect on the skin?  I'm going to be moving into my own place within the month so I'm sure I'll get my answer then but I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion to weigh in on or if anyone experienced similar.

1,"Hey SCA❤ I've learned so much from this sub and stayed silent for so long. Here goes my first post!


I'm a 27 yo female from Phoenix, AZ and I had perfect skin up to 21 yo :(. Around this time I started wearing a lot of makeup and didnt have a good understanding of skincare...like none at all lol. I didnt care, unfortunately. Atm as of this month I feel like I'm more dry due to the Obagi but im combo for sure. My tzone gets oily throughout the day.


Fast forward some years after the acne started and I'm dealing with cystic, hormonal acne now. Around the age of 24 i went to see a dermatologist and after spending less than 5 minutes in the office they prescribed something that was $400 after insurance...I didnt feel confident the items would help or that the derm even listened to my concerns...I went in for advice, not to have products thrown at me expecting to know what to do with them - it's been so long that idr what the doctor prescribed me. 


I found r/SkincareAddition and you guys opened my eyes to Paula's Choice. The basic BHA and AHA creams changed my skin so much but I wasn't able to really fight the hormonal stuff well so I'd go on for years trying out other products...spending more than the original $400 I didnt want to spend lol but it's been fun learning about my skin and the science behind everything. 


That being said, I still have so much to learn and want to see if you guys have any advice for what I currently so and how I can implement a new vitamin c and aha product from Tatcha. The Violet-C Serum and mask both sounded amazing and I did like the reviews I've read about the hydration and cell turnover it can help with. I felt this was gentle enough and would help with the Obagi products I'm currently using for the acne I have - which, HOLY COW the ClenziDerm line has really change my skin so much. I saw a difference in just one night.


Should I completely eliminate the CosRX BHA blackhead power liquid while I'm going through the Obagi ClenziDerm products to clear my acne up? It's making a huge difference so I dont plan on quitting the Obagi products. 


I use the Obagi products because I only use a Clenser at night for obvious drying issues that come with Arizona plus the amount of makeup I wear require a double cleanse...well its basically a triple cleanse with their toner, it feels. 


I tried to find all the pH levels and typically go from thinnest to thickest, except the last step in my PM routine. Where ever I apple the benzoyl peroxide tend to get dry fast and flake overnight. To combat this, I tap the DE b-hydra to add more hydration back into those areas. Is this smart or is there something better I might try instead?



Would it be okay to keep the CosRX BHA before the Tatcha violet-c serum or should I replace the CosRX for the Tatcha?

Tatcha Violet-C Brightening Serum 20% Vitamin-C and 10% AHA: pH 4.5-5



Here's my current routine:

AM

	• IsnTree Hyaluronic Acid Toner: pH ??

	• Evian facial mist: pH 7.2

	• Secret key Starting treatment essence rose edition: pH 5-6?

	• CosRX BHA: pH 4.0

	• Tatcha Water Cream: pH ??

	• Murad City Skin Age Defense SPF 50 PA++++: pH ??



PM

	• Banila CO clean it zero clensing balm: pH 6.1

	• Obagi ClenziDerm Clenser Salicylic Acid 2%: pH ??

	• Onagi ClenziDerm Toner Salicylic Acid 2%: pH ??

	• Tatcha Water Cream: pH ??

	• Bragi ClenziDerm Benzoyl Peroxide 5%: pH ??

	• DE B-hydra: pH 5.7


As a somewhat unrelated note, I plan to get on the Obagi Nu-Derm line but only the Step 3 and 5 (Clear and Blender).  Also, not for another 3 months at the minimum because of how much this will cost. This will be in preparation for a VI-Peel. If you're not familiar with the Obagi products, this just means I am serious about my skin and if the product works then I will shell out the money.

2,"Hey guys so for the past few years I every so often get a single bump on my scalp that itches and is painful.  There's usually just one in one section at a time but there may be multiple ones in different areas at one time.  They feel similar to a bruise and the pain radiates outwards from the spot.  Touching it makes it feel worse and sometimes I don't even notice it till I touch my scalp.

My scalp also gets smelly and oily after only about 10 hours of not washing my hair.  I try to wash my hair once every two days.  I feel like the oil and smell could be related but I'm not sure how to address these issues because I wash my hair as frequently as I want to without drying it out.  Maybe a pH issue?

I've been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis but I don't think this is related.  Or maybe it is.  For the seb derm, I'm currently using 2% ketoconazole and it helps but it's also very drying on my scalp.

Some pics of the itchy bump are attached.  Anyone have any idea what this is?

The products I currently use on my hair are:

2% prescription ketoconazole

Free and Clear Shampoo

Nature's Zero Matte Clay to style

I sometimes use:  
T-Gel Extra Strength Shampoo

T-Sal Shampoo

I usually wash my hair once with the free and clear and then once with the ketoconazole shampoo, every two days.  I no longer use conditioner because I thought it could be making my scalp greasy.  I feel like I'm doing better without it actually.

hey all! so i started differin two weeks ago, because ive mainly been trying to combat these tiny tiny bumps all over my face? im not sure if this is my skin just being super clogged (that the differin will take care of) or something else! a few look like closed comedones, but you cant really notice a lot of them unless its in direct lighting (and theres a good hundred of these tiny bumps). they had calmed down this past week, but now are popping up more prominently around my mouth area. i do feel like my moisturizer could be causing the bumps. here is my routine:

morning:
- wash with vanicream gentle cleanser
- apply cosrx honey ceramide full moisture cream
- apply supergoop unseen sunscreen


night:
- use off-brand target sensitive skin makeup wipes (if needed)
- wash with vanicream gentle cleanser
- apply cosrx honey ceramide full moisture cream
- apply differin
- apply a bit more cosrx honey ceramide full moisture cream
- apply vaseline to areas prone to dryness

like i said, it might be my moisturizer. so i was thinking of switching over to cerave’s moisturizing lotion and the cerave skin renewing night cream. im not even sure if this is solely due to differin, or if this is even an acne-related issue. i have had these bumps for a few months now. i just want to make sure that this is a purge and that differin will be able to work for my skin.",1570982848.0,[Skin Concerns] Tiny flesh colored bumps all over face,0.83

I just discovered this sub, so I wanted to ask a question.

Years ago, about maybe 6 or 7, Vichy used to sell a cream that I don't know what kind of black magic had in the composition, but after applying it immediately brightened my face, removed every single line imperfection, and killed all the oil from my face. 

I have a super mega oily head, I mean to the point that 4 or 5 hours after waking up, I can pass a kleenex on my bald head and ends like the simpsons oily paper episode.

 It was like a miracle, even minutes after applying, there wasn't a single hint that I've used anything, even if you touched the skin you couldn't feel watery or oil, nothing, and the effect lasted around 3 or 4 hours, perfect for meetings and social events.

It was the Vichy Homme Normactiv Cg: http://www.expresschemist.co.uk/pics/products/46132/0/v-normactiv-cg.jpg

Later, this brand, for whatever reason, decided to throw away the product and bring to the market a new whole line, but my cream was no more, not even under another name and the new ones are totally shit

For years I've been searching to some other cosmetic that can have the same effects on my skin, but after trying like 20, none of them worked even remotely similar and I ended accepting my fate.

It’s a really warm and tingly sensation, like I’m having an allergic reaction. I’ve seen a dermatologist and she told me that it’s rosacea. I hadn’t changed anything in my diet or skincare routine when this started. I haven’t done anything out of the ordinary in the time leading up to this. I’ve noticed it also happens when I drink alcohol, even when it’s just one drink. But it was never this bad, and always just on my neck...not ever my face. It’s possibly that my awareness of it and stress are making it worse...and anxiety is another thing I’m trying to get a handle on. My dermatologist prescribed me Spironolactone and Minocycline to take orally, along with 2 topicals but so far, they haven’t done anything. If they do help, I figured they won’t start working for a few weeks/months but I don’t have high hopes. Here’s my skincare routine:

MORNING: Rinse with water, apply the Mirvaso that my derm prescribed me, and then moisturize with Neutrogena Hydroboost. 

NIGHT: Wash with CeraVe hydrating cleanser, apply the Metronidazole gel my derm prescribed me, and then moisturize with Hydroboost. 

My skin type is dry and...pimply, I guess. I’m sure I’m doing something wrong, or plenty of things wrong so feel free to give me ANY advice. I’m feeling so hopeless. I’m so sorry for this information dump, I’m just so desperate. I don’t wanna go out, or even go to work because of this. I’ll include a picture, it’s not great cause I snapped it real quick. That’s not even the full fledged flare up...it gets much more red and covers my forehead as well. I’m in Ohio, if that helps. I just wanna know if anybody has had similar experiences and if you’ve found a solution. Thank you soooo much to anybody still reading!

I started doing a bare minimum skin care routine (oil cleanser, foam cleanser, toner and then light moisturizer) a little bit ago and liked the change in my skin. With winter coming up, I decided to add a serum to my routine to make sure I stay properly moisturized.  

I used a serum a friend recommended that contained vitamin c, a retinoid and hyaluronic acid. I've used products like this before and had no issues or reactions.

About 5 days into using this product it started to BURN. Not a tingle, but it felt like my face are on fire. I was crying from the pain. I removed what I could from my face but my under eye areas were swollen and beet red. Its been over 24 hours and both of my under eyes are still pink and still sting (though they are better than before?)

The skin in a couple areas seems almost burned in texture too.

What can I do for my poor eyes? Does anyone know what caused this/how do I stop this from happening again?

Question regarding Home IPL and Facial Bleaching while following a skincare routine

Hi I was wondering where in my current skincare routine can I fit in home ipl and facial bleaching. 

For the last couple of years I have been using the lumea precision plus on my legs, underarms and bikini line with great success. I am Indian with dark hair, oily skin which is dry when I wash it but gets oily after an hour or so and  I have acne, acne scars and marks, uneven skin, just really bad skin. The acne has reduced greatly but I still have scars and huge pores. I also have a decent amount of dark facial hair which in the past I have used facial bleach FEM to lighten. To help the issue my current routine is 

AM
1. Wash face with cerave foaming facial cleanser

2. Cerave AM moisturizer

PM
1. Remove makeup with whatever I have on hand which has ranged from Nivea double effect to micelles cleaning gel wash to Banila Co Clean it zero, basically anything to take the makeup off

2. Cerave foaming facial cleanser

3. Sometimes I’ll use a toner as step three but not always

4. Few months ago I started using TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% every single evening and it’s helped heaps! Two weeks ago I bought TO Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% and I alternate the two as my last step. 

I don’t moisturize after as I’ve noticed my skin doesn’t feel tight after using either one of the TO products and after a couple of hours it gets oily. 

Seeing how I’m using acids where in my routine can I fit in facial bleaching and IPL? Would not using the TO products for two days on either side of facial bleaching be ok? Also how long a gap if I were to not use facial bleach and only use IPL?

I have been on tretinoin cream for 5 years and doxycycline (25mg per day) for 2 years and in combination with getting older, has reduced 90% of my acne. Unfortunately, my skin has now become discoloured and with large dots/pores on my face and dents that are noticeable in certain lighting.

My questions: 

1. What are the the dots? Large pores? I did not have this prior to having bad acne. Can they be reduced to normal?

2. Can my skin be returned to a normal “soft” state? 

3. What sort of work would likely be needed to be done? I am up for anything that isn’t heavy plastic surgery. I am aware I will likely need fillers for the dents from cysts. 

4. Is there a specific type of DOCTOR that specialise in this sort of thing and would be able to look at my face and know what to do? I am not wanting to just go to a beauty therapy place as I want the top level for my face.

First picture is from this morning under natural lighting, second picture was last night right after washing and moisturizing under indoor lighting.

Hello! This is my first post and if I messed up on any rules, let me know and I’ll be happy to fix it. I have a few questions near the end (I’ve bonded the entire paragraph), if you don’t feel like reading all this.


After my severe acne finally went away, I was left with red marks that never seemed to fade. I couldn’t figure out what it was and gave up looking for a way to get rid of it because the only answers I could find were that it would go away with time. I started looking into skin care again 2 years ago and have since stuck to a (basic) routine to at least keep my face clean while still looking for a way to get rid of the leftover red marks. 

I learned about Vbeam vascular laser treatment and how it can get rid of redness. I went to a derm and found out the reason my redness wasn’t fading, even after years of waiting, was because I had postinflammatory erythema (PIE). I had a test session in May 2017 where only a few spots were treated. Within a couple weeks, those same spots lost their redness and were the same color as my normal skin. 

I had my second treatment (first full treatment) in September 2017, where every red spot on my cheeks were treated. Again, I saw some improvement in about 1 month post treatment. My next appointment wasn’t until a year later, around October 2018. I don’t remember the energy settings from that appointment but they were slightly stronger than my first full treatment. During my second treatment, my derm used the double stacking to see if it would increase improvement. I had every red spot on my cheeks zapped twice. The healing did take a little longer and the swelling was much worse this time. I had a bunch of whiteheads appear within a couple days that covered almost the entire treated areas. It took about 2 weeks for the swelling to go away. I did notice there was much more improvement after this session.

My most recent appointment was 8 days ago and there was no change in energy settings from my appointment last year and I only had a single pass over my red spots. So far, I haven’t noticed any improvement and I actually had 2 pustules pop up within a few days post treatment. In the pictures, they are the more inflamed red spots, one near the top of my cheek, about eye level and one to the right out that and a little lower. The one that’s more inflamed popped prematurely while I was washing my face and the other one was already near the end of its lifespan when it broke while I was washing my face. I’ll be getting a double stack treatment at my next appointment. 

I’m not sure if it’s all that obvious from the pictures but the texture of my skin is very smooth. Running a finger over my cheeks, the red spots feel just the same as any other spot on my face without any. There aren’t any indentations and my skin there is also flat. 

I’ve been hesitant about adding any new products to my routine while undergoing treatment. I don’t want new pustules or acne to appear right before an appointment so I want to wait until after at least 2 or 3 more appointments before I decide. 

Has anyone else gone through multiple treatments of vbeam and had their PIE completely removed? I’m curious about how many treatments it took for you. It’s $350 per session for me so I’m hoping it won’t take another 5 sessions before I don’t need to go anymore. Also, I believe I just have PIE now but if any other issues I might have with my skin, I would love to hear. If anyone has also gotten results for PIE with other products, I’d love to hear that too.

And if anyone’s interested, here’s my super basic routine. I don’t really use anything like BHAs, niacinamide, vit c, retinoids, etc right now. I’m mostly focusing on just keeping my skin clean while waiting for my vbeam treatments. I do the same thing for both morning and night.

- Wash face with Neutrogen hydro boost hydrating gel cleanser
- Exfoliate with Neutrogena exfoliating cleanser every 4th day
- Moisturize with Neutrogena hydro boost water gel
- If I’m going outside, I put on Neutrogena hydro boost water gel lotion spf 50

I found that neutrogena’s hydro boost products don’t irritate my skin at all and don’t clog up my pores that much. The gel cream moisturizer is thicker than the water gel so I use water gel in the summer and gel cream in the winter. I think I have combo oily/dry skin type because my forehead can get really oily throughout the day but my cheeks and chin will get dry if I don’t moisturize enough. 

Hoping to hear some feedback from this great community

6,"TLDR: I’m unhappy with my fairly large purchase from Frank Body. I’m curious if it’s just me/if I’m crazy, and what is the skincare community’s general consensus on Frank Body? 

[Pictured here! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/MvCf0HQ) — everything but the lip tints. 

A few months ago I discovered that Frank Body offers payments via Afterpay. I thought that was really cool because I had been following their Instagram for a while now but hesitating on making a purchase and afterpay works great with my pay schedule. 

I bought: Anti Makeup Cleansing Oil, Send Nudes Lip Tint and Cherry Bomb Lip Tint, Express-o Body Scrub, Body Balm, Shimmer Lip Scrub, as well as the regular/best selling Coffee Scrub. All of this equalled [almost $100.](https://i.imgur.com/kvTPtUE.png)

I spent a lot of money on products I thought were fine tuned, marketed well, and “natural” but I haven’t been impressed with any of these products enough to repurchase or recommend. 

The makeup cleansing oil is kinda slippery and slimy and doesn’t fully removed eye makeup, the lip tints are VERY sticky with almost no pigment. 

The express-o body scrub is extremely gritty and smells weird, the shimmer lip scrub is an extremely small pot of scrub with “shimmer” but I still don’t understand the  selling point because yeah, it shimmers when the scrub is on your lips but there isn’t anything shimmery after rinsing. 

The body balm is suuuuper oily and turns to a slimy liquid since it’s coconut oil based and last but not least, the best selling Coffee Scrub is *fine, I guess* but there isn’t anything super special about it and i don’t really notice a whole lot of improvement to my skin. I’ve made body scrubs in the past for personal use and gifts and it (frankbody) just seems like a very simple formula. 

I also didn’t realize that while there are different scrubs advertised on their site, you could pick one and just stick with it for a body scrub/light face exfoliator/AND a lip scrub. Buying all three I realize now, was kind of silly. 

I guess I just came here to see if anyone else has experienced disappointment with these very overpriced products?
