[Personal] 2019: The year my skin went cray,"In early 2019, I had the best skin of my life. My face looked fair, with no PIE. I was not having any breakouts. And my skin was not flaking (I have very dry skin). I attribute it to a couple factors. 1. I was working out almost every day (sweating out that dirt). 2. I started and maintained a simple and consistent skincare regimen. And 3. I was on birth control. I was feeling so confident in my skin, that I was even going out (yes! In public!) without any makeup on.   

My regimen was:  

AM  
- TO Buffet
- Origins Ginzing Moisturizer
- Origins Depuff Eye Cream
- Supergoop Sunscreen 40spf

PM
- Fresh Soy Face Cleanser
- TO Buffet
- Fresh Lotus Night Cream
- TO Rose Hip Seed Oil (2-3x week)

Shower only
- Origins White Tea Cleanser

Then in the spring, my doctor took me off BC due to some medical issues I was having at the time. I was freaking out. I had been taking BC for over 8 years, and was terrified about how my body would react to the change. The first month went by and I didn’t notice any changes (other than my boobs getting smaller ☹️). But then in month 2, I got my first period after quitting BC and all hell broke loose. I started getting acne all over my face, mainly concentrating on my chin and around my mouth.  

This continued throughout the summer. I decided to add some new skincare products to my regimen and see if that would help. Not gonna lie, seeing all the products mentioned on here was tempting me to try new things even more. 

Over the summer, I added some items to my PM routine:
- Drunk Elephant 1% Retinol Cream (2x week)
- Skin & Co Truffle Therapy Face Toner
- Caudalie Instant Foam Cleanser  

After I added these to my routine, I noticed my acne started to change from whiteheads in my chin/mouth area to deep, painful cysts around my jaw and temple. I never have had acne like this before. I didn’t even think getting acne on my neck was possible! 

In September, my doctor gave me the green light to go back on BC and I jumped on the chance. I thought this would fix all my skin problems. I decided to remove the Caudalie cleanser and Skin & Co toner - I thought they were possibly drying my skin out more and causing some of the acne. I wanted to go back to my original routine, and keep the DE Retinol Cream (cause I was enjoying that). 

It’s been almost two months since I went back on BC and my skin has not improved. I’ve gotten a string of cysts along my jawline. Some have disappeared but they have left horrible PIE. I also have not been able to get rid of the acne on my temple, and I’ve been getting breakouts on my forehead (another area I never really had acne issues with before).  

I feel so helpless and ugly. I absolutely hate that I have acne this bad as an adult. And it doesn’t help that I have a bad habit of picking at my skin already... so the PIE is even worse. Some days I just want to hide in bed away from everyone.  

So SCA, just keep being and doing you. Following this sub has been a light for me on some of my darkest days this year. I hope others who may have similar problems as me know that you’re not alone. I’ll be here and (hopefully) have an update for you all when my skin stops acting like a brat.",1571972734.0,1.0,1
[Sun care] does anybody wear zinc oxide sunscreen in the public?,"I was wondering if anyone wears zinc oxide sunscreen in the public without worrying about their appearance. I wear zinc oxide sunscreen in public and people look at me all the time. I had someone say behind my back ""look at that man with the white-face."" Last weekend I had a guy ask me ""why are you wearing makeup"", I simply just told him it's not makeup. It's a struggle being a man and wearing zinc oxide sunscreen. I honestly don't care but I just wondered if anybody else goes on wearing zinc oxide sunscreen in the public and receives the same reaction.",1571972411.0,1.0,3
"[Skin Concerns] Losing confidence in routine, I keep getting new cystic acne?","I have combo skin (oily t zone, dry sides) and messed up my barrier with years of Angels on Bare Skin. Further messed up my skin with a month of bad OCM decisions; I started getting a lot of tiny bumps on the sides of my chin. 

I stopped using all oils and Angels on Bare Skin until I could calm my skin down and figure out what was going on. 

The bumps kinda grew into pimples / cystic painful bumps.

I've now been using Vanicream Gentle Cleanser & Lite Lotion for a few weeks.

My skin is looking better, I think. It feels more moisturized, even tho it feels a tad tight after I finish using the Cleanser. But sometimes I lose confidence that it's even working. It seems every day I'm getting new cystic / deep / painful bumps on the sides of my face. They eventually grow into pimples, which I'm trying hard not to touch or pop. I don't know. It doesn't look too much worse, but they're still cropping up (at more or less a constant rate?). How long should I wait until it seems more under control?

I'm just kinda feeling bad for even trying the OCM because it seemed it messed up my face more than Angels on Bare Skin. Angels kept me dry, but at least I didn't get cystic bumps :( I wonder if it's ever gonna clear up and get to like it was before.",1571971768.0,1.0,1

His brothers never had an issue with dry skin apparently but he’s only 14 so it’s probable that due to hormonal fluctuations or something of the sort (I’m no dermatologist) has caused him to be more prone to dry skin.

[Routine Help] Do you tailor your routine to your hormonal cycle?,"I've read a few articles/blogposts about tailoring your skincare routine to where you are in your hormonal cycle. 

However, I also know lots of skincare products/prescriptions are accompanied by the caveat that you may not see a result for weeks or even months. Could micro-managing with respect to the days of your cycle really have that much of an effect?

[Routine Help] Need Help w/ Incorporating TO's Products,"Age: 16
Sex: Male
Race: African-American
Skin Type: Oily
Acne Type: Mild, but somewhat stubborn

So my routine has changed a LOT since 2016/2017, and my skin has seen it all. I've been through Clean & Clear (hate them, their products are the only ones that my skin hates), salicylic acid (used at 2% for a scrub), benzoyl peroxide (used at 10% in a cleanser), glycolic acid, sea kelp extract, vitamin c, clay, ACV, etc. My skin is really resilient and can surprisingly handle a lot of ingredients well.

My routine is the following:

AM

0. Pre-wash with warm water to remove surface dirt and allow for soap to glide better.

1. Wash with liquid black soap for about a minute, and wash off. Pat face dry.

2. (Before yesterday) Massage Thrive Face Balm onto face and neck.

PM

0. Pre-wash with warm water to remove surface dirt and allow for soap to glide better.

1. Wash with liquid black soap for about a minute, and wash off. Pat face dry.

2. Press Andalou Naturals Turmeric + C Enlighten Serum into face and neck.

3. (Before yesterday) Massage Thrive Face Balm onto face and neck.

On Sunday nights, I use my Andalou Naturals Pumpkin Honey Glycolic Mask after my serum. 

On Wednesday nights, I use my Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask after my serum, use my serum again, and then use my Andalou Naturals Pumpkin Honey Glycolic Mask .

On Friday Nights, I just use my Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask after my serum, and then use my serum again.

Key Things:

1. I'm out of a moisturizer, but I do have cold pressed argan oil. It's not a moisturizer, but it's the closest I have to it. I haven't moisturized though in 2 days.

2. I'm going to get hate for this, but I don't use sunscreen. During the week, I get driven to and picked up from school, so I'm only in the sun for about a minute every day (plus there's a large tree by the entrance with shade). However, I should work on using it when I'm outside for long periods of time, as I get way too lazy.

My question is should I add The Ordinary's Niacinamide + Zinc and the Glycolic Toning Solution to my routine? I've read some horror stories about the niacinamide regarding ""niacin flush"", acne flare ups, and scars that they've had trouble fixing. I've also read reviews where people say they've had bad reactions to it, but I also see people love it a lot. Seeing as I really don't react much to new ingredients, should I take a gamble?

Also, since I use my glycolic mask twice a week and I don't have a good toner, should I use the toning solution? If so, when in my routine, and how often? I'd really love your feedback.",1571967740.0,1.0,1

"[Acne] Deep small bump around chin turned into a pimple with a hardened head, how should I proceed?","So I had a cluster of small, under the skin bumps around my chin since my last period which I had always thought were just deep hormonal pimples and figured they would either go away on their own time or I’d eventually get my hands on a chemical exfoliator to gently exfoliate them out. One of the bumps recently developed into a somewhat deep pimple that came to a head and hardened. I left it on my face because I had just ordered cosrx pimple patches and didn’t want to pop it until I had my bandages to put over it. I just popped it (I lanced it carefully, squeezed out some of the gunk and then placed a hydrocolliod over it) but I was wondering if there’s something else I should be doing. I’ve had experiences in the past where I’ve used a hydrocolloid bandage on a deep pimple and it’s ripped out all of the gunk and left a hole so I’m not sure what’s the gentlest method for me to go about taking care of this. Should I just use Vaseline? Should I use Vaseline and then put a bandage over it?",1571967307.0,1.0,1

Most of my life I’ve been able to get by with just a lite moisturizer which I like because I have acne prone skin but not this year.

I’ve read that depending on the formulation of hyaluronic acid it can be bad to use at high elevation or dry climate because if there is more oxygen in your skin rather than the air it will pull moisture from you skin instead.

[Personal] My 6 month skincare journey. From hopeless to hopeful - thanks to this community.,"I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit, but felt compelled to share my journey after gaining so much from all of you. I also hope I now have some knowledge to share after finally being happy with my skin in so long.

&nbsp;

*Back story:* For the last 2-3 years, my skin has been incredibly dry, irritated, sensitive, red and prone to cystic acne. It was also dull and starting to get a lot of fine lines and hyperpigmentation (but I assumed this was just ageing and pretty much irreversible.) Basically every single skin concern you can have, all over my face. 

&nbsp;

I got unhealthily obsessed with skincare and must have spent 1000€+ on products within a year (Avene, LRP, TO, Cerave, etc etc). I saw a dermatologist, without much success and everything I put on my skin just seemed to make it worse - even the most delicate products designed for highly sensitive skin. 

&nbsp;

I came across a post on this community about damaging you skin barrier that really resonated with me and I ended up throwing everything I owned away (I actually now regret that as I've ended up repurchasing a lot of things) But it helped in the long run.

&nbsp;

After years of exfoliation, the skin barrier article made complete sense to me. I had done so much damage to my skin that it was completely ruined to the point that even things like the LRP cicalplast balm irritated me.  I decided to go back to basics... I was strict with only a Cerave moisturising cleanser, a treatment cream recommended by my dermo and LRP shaka fluid sunscreen. The first weeks where really rough. My dry skin was so bad and flaky, I felt compelled to exfoliate and did a few times with a Konjac sponge, but for the rest I kept it simple. 

&nbsp;

Fast forward to 6 months later and my skin has never looked better. I have a glow, no dryness, limited redness, tighter skin and minimal breakouts - infact now I have the opposite problem, my skin has become slightly oily - I thought my dry skin must be genetic because i've had it for so many years, but in actual fact it was just very damaged. Now i actually have come to like the glow of a bit of oil.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I wanted this post to help people who like me, keep spending hundreds of dollars on skincare products and who are not seeing results and feeling more and more hopeless, you start to believe that skin is ""just like that"" and always will be. The truth could be that all the money you are spending on 'helpful' products are just doing more harm than good. Take a break, let your skin really heal and it will be worth it.

&nbsp;

After 6 months, I have finally reintroduced actives, and for the first time they are working well with no irritation. I thought my skin just 'hated' retinols and acids, but really I just had a damaged skin barrier that needed time to repair itself.

&nbsp;

**A few other things that helped improve things:**

- Double Cleansing (LRP Micellar water and Cerave moisturising cleanser)
- Cleansing for 60 seconds (reduced my breakouts by 50%)
- Changing pillowcases every few days
- Improving diet as much as I can (I definitely could still eat better though) 
- Getting enough sleep (listen to the podcast ""Why we sleep"" to learn why it's important
- Not eating salt before bed and sleeping with a slightly raised pillow (reduced eye puffiness by 80%)

[trigger warning] Question about using silicones to fade scars,"
I used to self harm and have a range of scars that are for the most part flat or slightly sunken in. Some have redness and “fuzziness” (undefined borders?) around them. I’ve been through some old threads and found many people seeing good results with silicones.

Now the question: what types of silicones and what products that have them should I look at? I’ve been planning on getting TO’s vitamin C in dimethicone because I find that it is a silicone that doesn’t break me out or cause irritation. I also figured the vitamin C would help with fading the discolored tissue and reduce some of the redness. Plus the price was good considering the surface area I need to use this over. Is this an ok assumption? Should I consider something else?",1571953493.0,0.5,2

I, like many others, was ecstatic to try out Purito's new unscented sunscreen. It is the ONLY sunscreen I have tried that doesn't dry out my dehydration-prone skin. 

I can't use anything with alcohol, so for a loooooong time Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk has been my HG, but although it always kept my skin protected (even on 100+ degree beach days), it dries out my skin horribly. 

The release of Purito's Unscented initially seemed like a GODSEND, especially after reading [LabMuffin's review](https://labmuffin.com/purito-sunscreen-review-safe-sun-unscented-sun-comfy-water-sun-block/) (who is really the only skincare blogger I feel I can trust). However, due to conflicting information about the actual UVA protection of the sunscreen that I continuously keep on stumbling across, I can't help but feel skeptical about the legitimacy of Purito's PPD test. (Sorry Purito!!!!!! I hope so badly I'm just being paranoid!!!)

[This is their product's page.](https://puritoen.com/product/purito-centella-green-level-unscented-sun/54/category/71/display/1/) They provide a chart stating that the PPD is 22.59. In their Q&A section at the bottom of the page, they state the UV filter's percentages (3% of Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate and 2% of Ethylhexyl Triazone).

Anyways, what are everyone's thoughts on all of this info? I know I'm not the only one who's been speculating. Does anyone have personal experience after wearing this sunscreen? I'm far from a chemist, so if the filter %s are accurate are they enough to provide legitimate protection? etc... etc.... etc....",1571952484.0,1.0,5

[Routine Help] I need your advice/knowledge/recommendations from Arbonne skin care lines!,"Hi everyone. I’m looking for some advice before I jump on the next bandwagon of trendy skincare. The topical ointments/antibiotics prescribed to me for my hormonal acne are not effective for my skin, and have major side effects like excessive drying, peeling, cold sores, and break outs. I am taking Doxycycline Monohydrate, and applying Tretinoin 0.05% cream at nights. Keep in mind that I have been trying them for a few months now, not just a week:). I have a dermatologist appointment in 2 weeks, and want to discuss some research and changes that I have looked into. I would prefer not to have to use more steroids/antibiotics/medications for my face. 

This being said- has anyone heard of or worked with Arbonne? I’ve been chatting with one of their consultants about some of their skincare products lately. The company seems to be very eco friendly. They don’t test on animals, and the products are vegan and paraben free, which makes my sensitive skin so absolutely happy at the possibility of healing it! 

The products recommended to me are the RE9 Prepwork line, as well as the Clear Future line with Renewal Serum (most likely the one I will go with). They are both reasonably priced, and are  kind of enticing to buy, as the preferred client fee is waived this month.

I’m currently on the hunt for a new skincare brand and regimen. I have been a Lush fan for the longest time, but I am becoming skeptical about some of their ingredients. I’d love to find a brand that is “clean”, cheap, and cruelty free (if such a thing exists). I’m a 29 year old female with combination skin. I prefer my skin to feel hydrated. I usually don’t struggle with acne, but I can get a nasty cyst or two on my cheeks or chin during that time of the month. After said break out, I can get a stubborn scar or dark spot that takes its sweet time disappearing. I also find that my skin tends to misbehave more in the winter than it does the summer. There are definitely some fine lines becoming more noticeable on my forehead. I love the sun and facial expressions. Lol. Side note: I am getting married this summer, so I’d like my skin to be in the best shape possible!

I’ve heard some good things about Drunk Elephant, Ghost Democracy, The Ordinary, Olehenriksen, Glossier, Farmacy, and Youth to the People. But again, it’s hard to find the three Cs.

I'm wondering if I'm applying it wrongly or too often? I have pretty oily skin so I apply a thin layer over my face post-cleanse a few times a week and make sure I moisturise extra, but usually I just apply it directly to a pimple at night.

I just got off my period so maybe it's hormonal but it's a LOT worse than usual. I'm wary of going to my gp since I feel like it's trivial compared to other issues I have.....but it's really affecting my self-esteem and feeding into my depression so. Idk.

I'm really not sure if I'm sensitive, overusing it or perhaps my skin is just purging. Has this happened to anyone else?

-A day later flat painless small spots around mouth and on lower cheeks - coming and going.
-maybe small bumps like closed comedomas on my forehead (but i sometimes had them myself)

I am trying not to panic. I started to take zink supplements. As it is impossible to get to dermatologist before something really serious, I found some vaginal cream Econazole, applying it on my forehead and other spots. I wash my head with Nizoral shampoo, just in case.

[Skin Concerns] How can I relieve this irritation around my eyes?,"Hi there, I'll also post this to the eczema subreddit when i get the chance, just wondering if you guys had any advice? My apologies if this belongs in the advice thread.

I have these patches of dry, scaly skin around my eyes, most notably on my right. It doesn't seem to have been triggered by anything, I have not changed my routine in months and we're long past hayfever season here (though this first appeared August-time). I *do* have diagnosed eczema, though it is usually on my hands and very obviously caused by irritants like clothing, extreme weather/moisture, and responds to steroid creams just fine. The patches near my eyes are similar in texture but are obviously different in that they itch and burn like hell. I cannot describe to you how much this sucks. Looking at screen in a dark room (ie. a lecture theatre) seems to make it worse. 

My routine looks like this:

* AM: Wash Simple moisturising facial wash (""soap free foam"")
   * Simple soothing facial toner (the one with niacinamide in it, though i dont put this anywhere near my eyes, just my cheeks)
   * Moisturise with Nivea Creme
* PM: Simple purifying cleansing lotion (sometimes) (again not near eyes)
   * Moisturise with Nivea creme

I will of course book a GP appointment ASAP, however waiting times are very long here, I have spoken to a pharmacist and he said not to put steroid creams on it as the skin is so thin, and to use a mild/fragrance free moisturiser. Notably some moisturisers do make my skin burn, particularly around my eyes (E45 in the big bottle and simple rich lotion do this).

I was wondering if any of you knew of any short-term ways of soothing it while I wait for a doctor? Scratching brings sweet sweet relief for about 5 seconds and I have used the cool metal of my water bottle in a pinch. pls help",1571946844.0,1.0,4

[Skin Concerns] Do I need to do extractions or do I just wait for skin to unclog itself?,"I have skin that is both dry and oily and as a result I am prone to very bumpy, congested skin consisting of open and closed comedones and some keratin bumps. This is all over my face including the forehead, temples, cheeks and nose!

I have recently started a new regime and it seems to be helping with the Cerave Smoothing SA Cleanser and  Smoothing Cream which contain Salycilic Acid and Urea (in the cream). These products are helping after just a few days and my skin seems a bit smoother.

Usually my comedones etc are quite stubborn and hard to extract but I am noticing that some are getting easier to squeeze which seems like a good sign.

My question is do I need to do extractions or if I just wait will the products do most of the work and my various bumps and blackheads will just go over the next few weeks?

My plan was to do what I could at home and then after a few weeks go to a beauty therapist to have any stubborn bumps etc extracted I just don't know what I should be doing?

Should I just wait, follow my regime for a few weeks more or should I be steaming my face, extracting or using a clay mask (does that even work it remove bumps?)

So should I extract or should I just wait and if I should extract how best to help unblock the bumps?

[Routine Help] Trying to lighten PIH/PIE,"I was pretty horrible to myself in my teens. Never used sunscreen (although I was rarely ever outdoors) and always had a terrible skin picking habit. My skin now is clear for the most part, but there's some pigmentation I'd like to get rid of in the form of freckles/sunspots and redness. I've been trying to work on a routine to lighten these and wondering if I could improve it.

AM:

* Rinse with water
* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Hyaluronic Serum

[Acne] I have some questions about my acne and the things I have been prescribed. Your help will be appreciated!,"I scrubbed my face with sugar 5 months ago and my forehead broke out after 2 days. I have never had acne like this ever. The pimples I normally have, hurt and itch and go away with time. But the acne on my forehead doesn't hurt or itch, I don't feel anything. It has almost been 5 months now and the acne I have on my forehead, has persisted for 5 months and not showing any signs of going away, which is the only problem I have. I'm not breaking out or anything, just this stubborn acne isn't going away. [This is what it looks like](https://i.imgur.com/dcjQUkV.jpg)

I had consulted with the best dermatologist in my city, 10 days ago, and these are the things he prescribed:
**•Isotretinoin 20 mg on alternative nights(80mg per week) for 2 months.**
**•Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion 1%.**
**•Fusidin(Fusidic Acid cream).**
**•Cefuroxime(antibacterial) 250mg for 20 days** 

The reason I'm posting here is that, the clindamycin lotion doesn't seem to be working well, because my pimples are getting more inflamed since the day I have started applying that. It looked better before I started using that. I would have thought that it was because of Isotretinoin's initial effects, but it had started getting inflamed after the first time I applied it, before taking my first isotretinoin pill. I'm not saying that it should work in just 10 days, but it's making my acne more inflamed. It has been 10 days, I have taken 5 isotretinoin pills, and I'm applying everything regularly but I haven't seen any improvement yet, it became more inflamed instead.

The question is, should I stop using clindamycin or should I wait for everything to eventually work? it doesn't seem to be working, to me though.

Also, if that doesn't work, do you think isotretinoin will treat my stubborn acne? The dose is low, that too on alternative days and I'm not sure if it will work or not. I haven't started experiencing any of the side effects yet, my skin is still oily, lips are fine, and everything is normal.",1571942205.0,1.0,2

3. Timeless Matrixyl Synthe’6

4. Isomers Matrixyl-4 (although I havent seen any reviews on it, but the premise sounds good)

5. Skin Medica TNS (uses EGF, perhaps the most reputable brand for it)

6. Survival by NIOD (full of antioxidants, blue light protection, etc) . (Or Literally any product from NIOD, I’m surprised it isn’t talked about more on here.)

7. Adapalene 0.1% or Retinaldehyde  — I’m actually unsure which is most appropriate to put around the eyes and which has more anti-aging benefits.

9. Acid Peels. For around the eyes, it looks like TCA 7% is recommended, but I wont be purchasing that for her because I don’t want her to burn herself. Makeup Artists’s Choice and Platinum Skincare seem like good brands with efficient pH’s.

My skin starts flaking again by early afternoon. I’ve read the skincare science guide on dehydrated skin, and as far as I know, I’m doing the right things…hyaluronic acid, creams, occlusives. I feel like none of it is working. My skin was the best it has ever been through the summer, but now with the changing seasons, I’m struggling to keep up from the dryness.  I have a prescription for tretinoin (for acne) and have used it successfully in the past but have had to stop since my skin has gotten so dry. 

I get the feeling that my sunscreens are making things worse, as they both feel so drying,(generally dislike them both) but I’m really not sure about any of it at this point. I’m considering trying Elta MD physical sunscreen…would this be a reasonable choice for my skin?

As far as the rest of my routine, I’m a broke graduate student – so I’m not going to repurchase the Dermalogica when I run out. I’m also phasing out the Honest Beauty Hydrogel for since I’ve gone though it SO fast and have to repurchase it every 3 weeks. I ADORE it though and would love to find something similar at a more affordable price point (for how often I'm repurchasing.)  If I can’t, I might just end up back with it again.

•La Roche Posay Dermo cleanser 

•Pyunkang yul essence toner (new product)*

•Elf beauty shield vitamin c serum (new product)*

•Cerave eye cream 

•Glow recipe watermelon moisturiser

Chest spots help [Acne],"So ever since may when I went to the beach with my chest exposed without sunscreen I have had these bumps on my chest that I can’t seem to get rid of. The breakout started out awful and a walk in doctor made me apply betaderm because he thought it was a sun reaction. It helped a little but no where near enough. My doctor gave me doxycycline after I couldn’t get rid of residual bumps and kept having little breakouts. I took it and my skin cleared after 2 weeks. When I stopped, within 3 days I broke out massively. I was going away so I got another dose to hold me over. My skin cleared again within 2 weeks. I got back home, saw the dermatologist after the doxy ran out and she started me on itraconazole and a topical cream with antibiotics, an antifungal and hydrocortisone. My skin cleared completely and was clear for about a week after stopping itraconazole. She then told me to keep up with the cream and to take fluconazole once a week to fully get rid of it. Now I have little bumps that seem to just come up as soon as others heal. They are so small and not super red or anything but I’m so frustrated and done. I’m not sure what to do. Anyone had an experience like this?

For reference my routine is:

Am: rinse with water, apply cream 
Pm: wash with cetaphil cleanser and apply cream",1571940144.0,1.0,1

[Product Question] Similar Moisturiser to Curology?,"I use Curology solely for the tretinoin but I also got sent a sample bottle of their [moisturiser](https://curology.com/static/moisturizers1-723e49395fdee16a01dfd40d91f76d9d.jpg) and it's been such a pleasant experience.

I want to keep this kinda short. I’m in my mid-twenties I have persistent hormonal acne. I’ve had it since I got off the pill a couple years ago due to unrelated health concerns. The past year or so it got significantly worse while battling bouts of depression. 

And now my father passed away suddenly 3.5 months ago (who I still lived with, took care of, took care of me, and was the person I told everything to) so for obvious reasons my stress levels, hormones, and depression have been like a ride on a roller coaster. I miss him. And I’m aware I need to go to the doctor, but I’m currently paying all the bills and took over the house for my mom and dinner every night adds up and I just can’t afford health insurance right now. 

I used to be lactose intolerant as a child, I’d eat something with dairy and get terrible stomach pains, I had acid reflux, and I drank what I used to call “fake milk”. I had stomach ulcers and had to have surgery at age 8. But By the time I turned 12/13 I started drinking milk and cookies again and telling my parents I could handle it. My stomach hurt less and less and I convinced myself I wasn’t lactose intolerant anymore. I went on drinking all the milk and eating all the cheeses.

My question is, is it at all possible that maybe I am still lactose intolerant. Because I just read an article stating you don’t really outgrow being lactose intolerant. People can apparently outgrow milk allergies but no being L.I.

I went out a couple days ago and bought cashew milk for cereal, snacks, cooking with, smoothies, etc. 
....
Am I lactose intolerant and just don’t get the crazy stomach pains? Am I crazy and this is all unrelated? 

Has anyone thought they outgrew being lactose intolerant and then realized it was the dairy (that your technically intolerant to) causing their hormones to rage and cysts to persist? I don’t know, I feel like I’m on to something. Thanks SCA 🙏🏼",1571938618.0,1.0,4

[Acne] Closed Comedones from Hell,"&#x200B;

[my chin seems to be peeling hmm... ignore my new peel beard](https://i.redd.it/k6sl6nndwiu31.jpg)

Hi guys! I just wanted to start off with saying I've been a long time reader and have learned so much from this amazing community! I've been dealing with texture issues for about a year and I'm going insane. Growing up I never had any zits and now it feels like i'm going through puberty! Usually when people say ""i have a texture problem"" the solution seems to be chemical exfoliation, but unfortunately I've already tried that!

I went to the doctor last December and he gave me a benzoyl peroxide wash that I don’t use because it dries the hell out of my skin and retin-a. I'm about 5 weeks into retin-a and honestly don't see that much of a change. Regardless of what I've told my doctor, seeing a dermatologist feels impossible unless it’s a more “severe” case. 

Previously, I was having issues with cystic acne but switching from cosrx’s BHA and AHA to Paula’s choice got rid of cystic issues. But I’m still getting these darn closed comedowns on my cheeks that refuse to go away unless I get a facial and they’re extracted. What's the point of extracting these if they're just gonna come back. My biggest issue was always having dry skin, and I've experienced over-exfoliation in the past. Stratia helped me replenish my moisture barrier and it feels the best it ever has been. Living in Los Angeles makes it even more difficult with the dry climate. And... I do change my pillow case every. other. day. I don't wear make up and never have, but now I'm starting to feel really self-conscious about my skin and feel the urge to cover things up.

Can one of you amazing people tell me if I’m doing something extremely wrong with my routine? I'm really tired of trying new items and spending so much money.

* Paula’s choice SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant

Climbazole an anti-fungal active, also used as a preservative, is a Cytochrome P450 enzyme modulator. This latter is involved in Retinoic acid degradatation, which is the active form of Retinoids also known as Tretinoin. 

So as studied, limiting the degradation of Retinoic acid could make your Retinol, Retinaldehyde, Retinoid Ester more effective.

Its anti-fungal activity is also great to deal with fungal acne, seborrheic dermititis and dandruff.

I got 6 cm x 7cm sheets, that I cut in to about 12 pieces.

They don't absorb gunk out of your pimples, but they're breathable and let the wound breathe, while keeping bacteria and makeup out. They also help to keep the spot ""moist"" so it doesn't get dry and scabby, which would really tempt me to pick. Because they are so thin, they are much less noticeable, and adhere to the skin pretty well.  They say that they can be worn on the skin for up to 7 days, which I just don't think is realistic on your face, but I have worn one for about 24 hours, so it lasted through 3 skincare applications, and makeup, just fine.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense: SPF 50 Tinted sunscreen|B+ for performance, F for lack of skin tone inclusivity|$34 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Good for sensitive skin, and did not sting mine.                  -- Covers up slight redness and evens out skin tone, if it matches yours. Seems to last all day if not rubbed or touched.                      --Cosmetically elegant formula that goes well under makeup once it dries.|\-- Only offers one shade that works for Caucasian skin tones. Surprise!           -- Clings to dry patches, so you must beware of this while using.|
|Skinceuticals Sheer Physical UV Defense: SPF 50 Transparent|D due to performance|$34 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Spreads very well and provides impressive coverage... if you are as white as a vampire.|\-- Intense white cast. STAY AWAY unless you are already extremely pale and want to look even paler. This is not a realistic sunscreen.   --Clings to dry patches horribly- you must exfoliate before using.  Creates white ""creases"" under eyes and in eyelids.|
|Elta MD UV Daily Broad Spectrum SPF 40|C+ due to clogged pores. Great otherwise, would be A++ if not for this :(|$28.50 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Highly moisturizing and does not highlight dry patches.  --Dries quickly and goes very well under makeup  --Niacinamide free! For people who react to this.                         --If you are someone whose skin is not prone to clogged pores, this would be good for you.              -- No white cast once dry                                        --Doesn't pill during reapplication.|\-- Contains isopropyl palmitate which DID clog my pores. Ugh. This is the only reason I can no longer use this sunscreen.|
|Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46|A+ for non sensitive skin.                                                 (Niacinamide-sensitive folks like me can't use this unfortunately.)|$35 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Moisturizing and does not cling to dry skin whatsoever            -- No white cast              -Not greasy                        --Goes well under makeup.                                --You can reapply without washing it off.

[Routine Help] Skincare and biking to work,"Hi everyone.

I had my routine on lock for a couple years now.

AM: Nothing, sometimes wash with water. Neutrogena sunscreen.

PM: Paula's Choice Pore Normalizing Cleanser, Gokujyun hyaluronic acid toner, and marula oil (various brands, all of which agreed with my skin). Occasionally The Ordinary Azelaic acid, various brands of vitamin c, and aztec clay mask.

I recently started biking to work, 30 minutes each way and I feel it's thrown things out of wack for me. I also moved to NYC a few months ago. My skin doesn't respond to marula oil, in fact it triggers acne. Aztec clay mask doesn't refresh my face like it once did. Whatever is wrong with my skin, acid is not helping and makes things worse. I applied just the HA toner on my face, but that doesn't help or makes things worse.

I'm getting acne where I usually don't (my forehead). My face looks dull, uneven, and kind of red. I'm really frustrated because things have been going so well and now I can really figure out the problem. Is it cleanser, hydration, moisturizing? I don't know.

So my question/request is two fold.

Any ideas of what might be going wrong?

[Acne] Major Acne on my chin and jawline area (Male 27),"Hey guys. I'm a 27 year old male that's dealing with major acne around the chin area.

I used to have a lot of acne on my forehead and cheek but it's gotten a lot better after cleaning my diet by getting rid of dairy and sugar.

But recently, acne started popping up around my jawline and it's been really frustrating. I've been doing the following:

1. No dairy and sugar. Eat a lot of whole foods and green vegetables. Also avoid greasy and fried foods.
2. Take multi-vitamins, Omega 3 Fat supplements, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin B12.
3. Do face wash ONCE a day.
4. After facewash, apply moisturizer on my face.
5. Wear sunscreen everytime I step outside.
6. Never touch my face.
7. After powerlifting, take a shower immediately.

After doing all these things, I still face major acne on my chin and it itches sometimes. My forehead and my cheeks are fine, but it's just my chin... I've read on reddit that this is hormonal acne and that I have too much of an imbalance on my hormones. If this is true, how can I solve my acne issue as a male?

I'm pretty young (23) so I'm not overly concerned about aging. I have noticed, however, that my skin doesn't have the same 'plumpness' anymore.

I'm putting this down mostly to weight loss and bone structure. I'm potentially too thin, rn.

I have noticed, however, that plenty of thin people still have that plump fresh face look.

I'm working on optimizing my diet, taking a ton of vitamin C, drinking more water, getting more sleep and quitting the nicotine (picked up vaping as a nasty habit when I was stressed in college, yikes!).

My skin care routine rn is probably not great (and overpriced):

* Micellar water to cleanse
* Emma Hardie balm cleanser
* Good Genes by Sunday Riley (3-4 times a week, and only at night)
* CEO moisturizer by Sunday Riley
* Tatcha eye cream
* Emma Hardie sunscreen

Sometimes I also cover my face in vaseline at night just because I feel like it does something?

I've always kind of had ""thin"" skin, if that makes sense. It's like it's stretchy and a bit loose. Not just on my face,  all over. I'm also very double jointed in some areas, so I'm wondering if I might just naturally make less collagen? My skin is otherwise combination but pretty dry.

Sunday morning I had washed and moisturized and wore a thin layer of powder foundation to help counteract my redness.

[Routine Help] Using Azelaic Acid for Closed Comedones,"Hi Everyone,

I also have red acne on my cheeksI started using it two weeks ago and I use it everyday during the morning and evening. I’m not the most knowledgeable about skincare, so was wondering if I could get advice about my routine and the order of using products.

AM:

* Cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
* Wait 5 minutes and apply Finacea (15% Azelaic Acid)
* Wait 5 minutes and apply Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Face Cream with Hyaluronic Acid for Extra Dry Skin
* Wait 2 minutes and apply SPF

* Cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
* Wait 5 minutes and apply COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid OR Paula's Choice BHA (I alternate between these 2 everyday)
* Wait 20 minutes minutes and apply Finacea (15% Azelaic Acid)

Masks:

* Sulfur De la Cruz mask twice a week for 10 minutes

I’m confused about the order and wait time between using the above products. Should I use the AHA/BHA before or after the Finacea? And when should I use the moisturizer?

1. I've been reading about Hyaluronic Acid and was wondering if I need to use a different moisturizer on top of the Nuetrogena Hydroboost or will this alone be enough?
2. Is there room to incorporate TO Niacinamide in my current routine? If so, in where in my routine do I add this and how often do I use it?

I'm looking to switch to one of the two OTC retinoid products that Dr Sam Bunting recommends: LRP Redermic R or Avene Physiolift Night Balm.

From what I can see from the ingredients (their EU repective websites), Redermic has retinol while the Avene one uses retinal. It is often said that retinalhyde is better than  retinol. However, the Avene one includes a red dye (which the LRP doesn't) and fragrance and the dye are both higher up the ingredient list than the retinal while this isn't the case for the LRP.

Let me know what you think.  What would you prioritize? Did you try any of these products and what was your experience?

[Routine Help] Looking for advice for a skincare beginner with rosacea,"This is my first post here, and I'm a total beginner when it comes to trying to do a good skincare routine.

I have rosacea, which makes me have a permanently red t-zone which I cover with makeup on most days. I am acne prone, although I am 36 and it is mostly under control lately compared to when I was younger, unless I eat too many sweets/drink too much coffee which is rare for me these days. My concern right now is to be taking care of my skin enough to age as well as I can. Looking for any advice of what I could add/remove from my routine - especially exfoliation, as I don't do that right now but my skin feels dull and I think I need to. I live in Germany so it's easier for me to find products here, but I will consider ordering online for any exfoliation/peeling products that people recommend for skin with rosacea. I'm also curious if I should be adding anything to my morning routine, I've always been hesitant to layer moisturizer and sunscreen since I don't want the efficacy of my sunscreen to be affected. Thank you :)

My daily routine:

AM:

Wash face with warm water (in winter), with Dr. Bronner's tea tree oil soap (in summer).

Apply MAC prep & prime SPF 50 (I'm thinking of switching to a La Roche Posay face sunscreen soon.)

PM:

Do an oil cleansing using olive oil

Wash off oil/makeup with Dr. Bronner's tea tree soap

Tone (to remove any extra dirt leftover) using Hej Organic face tonic

Early 30s with occasional cysts and a really terrible work schedule so I'm trying to find a somewhat simple routine that can miraculously help with acne, fade some scars, and get the jump on anti-aging . Easy, right? 

I'm pretty dry around the chin (with pimples here) and somewhat oily on my forehead. Used accutane years ago which got rid of 99% of the cysts but I tend to get 1-2 a month, usually on my chin or cheekbones near my ears. Scars are on my chin.

Currently here is what I do:

AM: splash face with water, then use some TO caffeine serum under my eyes and hyaluronic acid overall. Put on SPF 50 and light makeup on top

PM: wash the TO squalene cleanser, use glycolic acid pad 2-3x per week, use sephora brand under eye cream and then DE marula oil overall.

Once a week: DE retinoid mixed with Dr Jart ceraminide lotion (otherwise I get really irritated). On a different night I use DE babyfacial or TO aha bha mask. I use hydrocolloid patches as needed overnight for breakouts. 

I have some DE vitamin C serum that I don't really know how to incorporate and I worry it'll make me break out more. I'm also not sure if the glycolic acid pads are really doing much except making my zits dry and flakey on my chin. I'd love to increase my retinoid usage but am scared by lots of peeling at work.

"[Routine Help] Looking for suggestions pertaining to facial cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens!","Good evening pals,

I am in desperate need of structure and cleanliness. Really looking to improve my hygiene overall. My morning and nightly routine are the first steps towards that!

First off:
I am looking for a few good products to kick off the start of my routine. I would like product recommendations under $10. My skin is fair in color and somewhat of a combination, leaning more towards dry. There are some places I get more oily where my hair touches, i.e. my forehead and the ""contour"" area of my cheeks right in front of my ears. The rest of my skin is usually dry.

Cleanser:
I am looking for a cleanser that doesn't irritate the skin, but gets it *clean*. I typically wear makeup and plan on wearing moisturizers and sunscreen. I also run in the mornings before my shower and need something that will leave me feeling fresh after being drenched in sweat. Something I can use AM/PM. Back when I lived with my parents, I remember using my mother's battery operated facial cleaning brush and always feeling very clean afterwards. Is this something I should invest in and how often can I use it? Daily?

Moisturizer:
I would like something hydrating for my dry skin, but not too heavy. I have had bad luck with lotions/moisturizers in the past feeling ""thick"", too oily, or drying out too quickly. I have seen good reviews for Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, though the product is expensive for the amount. Would I run into trouble if I used the Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream on my face?

Sunscreen:
Really at a loss of what to ask for here. Nothing too thick, but with a good SPF and protection for my fair skin. I don't want it to end up feeling oily and would like something that has staying power through sweat as I live in a high humidity year round area.

Makeup wipes:
I have the worst luck with makeup removing wipes. The ones I have tried feel as though they have almost no moisture in them and feel grainy/rough against my skin. Wipes are a must for me to remove a full face of makeup at the end of the day. I use to use cold cream which removes makeup like a dream, but I hated washing it off of my face/wiping it off with tissue. Same with liquid makeup removers. Wipes are a plus for me because it's all in one; I don't have to rub my fingers all over the product and my face of makeup (which usually ends in having to scrub my hands) I just use the wipe and never touch the icky stuff on my face!

Also, semi unrelated as I am talking about facial products, but I would *love* recommendations for:

Body wash with a good smell and *actually* cleans everything.
All over body lotion. 
& last but not least, good hand sanitizer?? I actually love hand sanitizer. I recently went to Bath & Body Works and they had scented hand sanitizers with scents like Georgia Peach and Japanese Cherry Blossom (my absolute favorite scent). However I don't need it to be scented, just quality to get my hands clean in between being able to wash.",1571889765.0,0.33,3

[Review] The answer to my dry dry dry tret skin prayers: Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream. (No more slug life!!),"Hi all, so I've been using tret (0.025%) for almost a year I think? Anyways, I already had dry + dehydration-prone skin prior to starting it. I had to ease into it, starting with Differin, suuuuuper slowly. 

I've tried **everything** to moisturize my skin. But holy crap, whenever I put makeup on, it looked so, so, so dry, cracking, flakey mess. I tried the slug life for YEARS using various occlusives - Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe healing ointment, Eucerin original healing cream, even 100% lanolin (broke me out :T). I'm into asian skincare so I already use like 23432 hydrating steps and lots of moisturizers underneath. 

But NOTHING was actually eliminating it?????? I couldn't stand one more day in lizard face. 

I have NO idea why, but for SOME REASON, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream gets rid of this problem. It just gets along with my skin so well???? I don't even NEED to slug life anymore! I just put that on as my last step and I wake up with mochi-hydrated skin!! I can't believe it tbh. I tried SO many moisturizers.. 

Well, I should say that the **combination** of using **tret every OTHER day plus using the Aveeno** as a sleeping mask has really saved my skin. No more nasty, cracking makeup!! 

I freakin' HATE the feeling of super stickiness that slugging gave me. I hate my skin sticking to things. Aveeno cream isn't perfect, but it's like 100000% less sticky than the other stuff I've tried. 

&#x200B;

Cons:

\- It can **pill. Horribly.** But only if you pair it with the wrong stuff. Some lotions/creams work well with it, and some don't (Clinique moisture surge cream & LRP lipikar AP+ baume do NOT play well with it, for example, but Triderma Eczema cream & Gold Bond Diabetics lotion are a-ok). This isn't a big problem for me though because I really only need *this* cream on top of my hydrating toners/serums to make my skin happy. 

\- This one is obvious but, please do not use if anything in this cream breaks you out. 

&#x200B;

I'm sure there are probably a lot of more expensive stuff out there that works just as well, but if you're strapped for money like I am, and aren't super acne-prone, this is a good option. If it doesn't work out for your face, you can always use it on your body/hands! 

(My Illiyoon ato ceramide cream just came in the mail today, so hopefully, it works well with it! So excited to try this!)

[Skin Concern] - What are these sudden bumps and how can I get rid of them?," https://imgur.com/hKJFI36 

Ok all, I need help. Typically I have clear skin and have never really had problems. Except these pesky bumps literally appeared overnight and I need to know how to get rid of them! My hunch is that I was using a drying routine. I've also been going through hormonal changes (switching BC). Before switching up my routine I'd use a direct acid and not moisturize, or just use Daily CeraVe. I have the same bumps around my chin that appeared around this time last year, when I started BC. If this is hormonal related, can I still treat it topically?

Here's my routine now:

Day:

Wash with water or with cream carrot cleanser from Yes to Carrots

Vitamin C powder TO + marine haularounics TO

Blue Lizard Face Sunscreen

Night: 

Wash with Yes to Carrots cream cleanser

TO Glycolic Acid

TO Squalane oil

CeraVe in the tub moisturizer

I've heard CeraVe in the tub can cause these, but I don't think its the issue since using it alone has never caused the bumps to appear.

[Routine Help] I think I'm double cleansing wrong... HELP!,"So I'll start off by saying that I have combo (dry/ oily) skin that is acne prone and tends to get pretty congested. However, I've been hitting a good stride with clearing up my skin and so I've been a little more comfortable experimenting with new products.

I recently purchased my first cleaning oil since YouTubers like Susan Yara and Liah Yoo seem to swear by a double cleanse. I picked up **THE FACE SHOP - Rice Water Bright Light Cleansing Oil** and have been using it for a few days in conjunction with my bar of **African Black Soap** (which gets very foamy). I must say that so far I am seriously disappointed with the results.

My makeup removing and cleansing process goes as following:

1. I use one pump of the cleansing oil on my dry skin and rub it around to dissolve my makeup
2. I dampen my hands with a little water and continue rubbing so the oil creates a bit of a creamy lather
3. I wash my face and try to get as much oil off as I can with just water
4. I then wash my face a second time with the African Black Soap bar
5. I pat dry my face and move on to other skincare steps

Now here are my issues- I expect that the double cleanse should take off all my heavy makeup (foundation, setting powder, bronzer, blush and highlighter) but when I tone after doing the steps listed above I'm still seeing makeup on the cotton pad. I also feel like my skin still has an oily residue ( which makes me scared that my pores are going to clog and I'm going to breakout like crazy)

This was not happening with the makeup removing balm I used and now I'm wondering if maybe the double cleanse is just not for me or maybe I'm doing something wrong. Can someone please weigh in?",1571882458.0,1.0,9

Looking for a nightly moisturizer [product question] [routine],"Hi everyone,  

Just looking for some recommendations for a nightly moisturizer. I think I have more oily/combination skin. My main “problems” are some closed comedones on my chin, I get the occasional pimple elsewhere, dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, forehead wrinkles,  and I’m prone to mosquito bites (idk if that matters). Here is my routine:

AM:
Wash face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser OR Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser

Apply Korres Wild Rose Vitamin C eye cream under eyes, wait a bit

Apply glossier bubble wrap under eyes, wait a bit

Mix a little Korres wild rose vitamin c serum with glossier priming moisturizer and apply to face, wait a bit

Apply biore UV water essence spf 50+, wait like 10-20 min and apply makeup (not a whole lot but I use skin tint and a little bronzer over my whole face)

PM:
Remove mascara with up&up oil free eye makeup remover when I use waterproof mascara (which is often)

Wash face with cetaphil daily facial cleanser OR gentle skin cleanser OR glossier milky jelly cleanser 

Sometimes (it goes from 0x/week to 3ish x/week) either Paula’s choice skin perfecting 8% AHA gel, or sometimes I alternate with Stridex maximum strength salicylic acid pads (I don’t use these as often, maybe a couple times a month)


Sometimes apply Korres vitamin c eye cream or another under eye cream I got in Greece 

For PM moisturizer I’ve been using Korres Greek  Yogurt 48hr moisture Pro advanced sleeping facial but am almost out. 


Before that, I used fresh lotus youth preserve dream night cream, and I have used exuviance age reverse hydrafirm several different times. I liked these but they are a bit pricey for me so I’m looking for something a bit cheaper. I usually don’t mind fragrance as you can tell, as long as it’s light (of the 3 night moisturizers I listed, I really really loved the fresh lotus the best.) I’m looking for something that can keep my skin well-moisturized overnight and will help with forehead wrinkles. I have some minor wrinkles elsewhere, but I am constantly scrunching and furrowing my eyebrows throughout the day (and night I’m sure) and have been for years. It’s an awful habit and I don’t notice I do it but my husband tries to remind me and I always have headaches because of it. Anyway, I’m trying to stop doing it but would like a nightly moisturizer to help me out if possible. From what I remember, exuviance was the best on my wrinkles, fresh lotus wasn’t so bad, and the korres greek yogurt helped some days but not most. I’d really appreciate some recommendations and also feedback on my routine if you guys wouldn’t mind. Thanks so much!",1571877680.0,0.25,2

Do you guys have any drugstore alternatives?","Last month, I finally decided to purchase an oil cleanser since I'd heard that it was good for oily skin. I pretty much picked one at random, because the one I was looking for was not sold at my local Walmart. I ended up getting Burt's Bees Cleansing Coconut + Argan Oil. I tried using it both standalone as well as to double cleanse. After about a week, my face began to look much more normal. I honestly haven't felt that confident in myself since I hit puberty, so it was a great feeling. Unfortunately, I also quickly realized that my acne was beginning to come back (at that point, I hadn't had a pimple in about 3 months). Using that oil cleanser was the only change that I made, so I stopped using it immediately. Last week, I was feeling really down and decided to use it once again, in case that breakout had been a fluke. It was the exact same result, although I only used long enough to get the breakout but not enough for it to help my oily skin. I'm now 20 dollars down the drain, although it seems that I've finally found a solution to my longstanding problem (I've dealth with extremely oily skin for about 2 years now).

[Routine Help] I need some help with double cleansing (oil cleansing),"So I've been trying multiple oil cleansers on my skin to remove makeup, such as the DHC one, Hada Labo and Kose Softymo Speedy.

I’m 24F in New England, USA, with pale, combo-dry, sensitive skin. 

My main concerns are: 
- Post Inflammatory Erythema and Hyperpigmentation 
- Closed Comedones (1-2, nothing crazy but annoying nonetheless)
- Some texture but it’s getting better! (Thank goodness.)
- Hormonal breakouts (I’m on Spironolactone (50 mg) and birth control (Yasmin) for this reason. So far so good, but I’m only on month 3 of taking each medication) 

**MORNING:**
1. Clean (I only splash water on my face)
2. The Ordinary “Buffet”
3. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% 
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA
5. Sun Protection

**EVENING:** (I am thinking of doing this 2x a week: Monday’s and Friday’s) 
1. Clean (Vanicream Gentle) 
2. The Ordinary “Buffet”
3. The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion (previously Advanced Retinoid 2%)
4. The Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane
5. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if needed)

**EVENING #2:** (My plan with this is 1x a month; Wednesday’s)
1. Clean
2. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution
3. The Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if needed)

**EVENING #3:** (Again, my ideal plan is 1-2x per month: Sunday’s)
1. Clean
2. The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution
3. The Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if needed)

And as most of you guys know, TO suggest alternating between the ‪three PM‬ routines throughout the week.

Here is my CURRENT routine: 

**AM:**
- I take a paper towel dampened with tepid water and gently wash off the Aquaphor from the night before. Then, take another sheet and pat my skin gently to wake myself up. 
- **SunBum Face Lotion SPF 50**

I am a very minimalistic type of girl. Especially in the morning. Less is better for my skin and mental health (anxiety, OCD and depression). 

**PM:**
- If I wear makeup, I use **DHC Deep Oil Cleanser** for 60 seconds, and, then, my **Vanicream cleanser**. But if I don’t, I repeat the tepid water compress on my face but with a microfiber towel for 10 minutes. This has really helped keep my skin clear. I have no idea why! It’s truly a mystery y’all, but I’m so relieved it does such a miracle. I’ve been doing this for about two months. 
- I then mist my face with DISTILLED water, and pat on **CosRx Snail Mucin Essence**
- **TO Buffet** is then applied 
- As of two days ago, I implemented **Stratia Liquid Gold** for the purpose of dehydration and some leftover moisture barrier issues. 
- **Vanicream Lite Lotion** or my **Aveeno Eczema Baby Lotion** 
> I bought the **CeraVe Baby Cream** today. Thinking of using that soon. I’m kinda skeptical because of an experience with other CeraVe products, but I heard this is different. So, I’ll definitely patch test to lower my anxiety. Has anyone used this moisturizer? Love to know your thoughts on it. Especially if you also have sensitive skin, too. 
- **Aquaphor** around the lower part of my face, chin and neck 

Now. **My 2 questions:**

- Is my plan for when to use the retinoid, the glycolic 7% toner, and the AHA BHA mask appropriate? I know that it would be way too much to use an acid with an acid. Moreover, a retinoid and a glycolic product. 

My intention with both is to get rid of texture, stop any breakouts, fade my PIE and PIH and smooth out my skin. 

- What would the Niacinamide + Zinc help with, exactly? I’m wary about using it due to horror stories on here from people saying they broke out with using it. So, I’m thinking of not putting it in my routine at all. Unless, y’all tell me otherwise!

[Skin Concerns] Does collagen improve or worsen scars??,"
Hi friends,

I really need help confirming whether or not collagen intake/production:synthesis helps wounds heal with LESS scar tissue or if it makes them heal with MORE scar tissue.

I’ve been doing a lot of reading and can’t seem to find the answer... I’ve read information supporting both sides... 

I get that collagen is crucial to healing and regeneration of tissues but given that scar tissue also consists of collagen, from what I’m reading it sounds like it can actually cause MORE scar tissue to form as the wound heals..

Is there a Goldilocks zone/happy medium to obtain? Should I supplement with collagen to decrease my chances of scarring or should I not bother because too much collagen really will just accumulate at the injury site and leave me with an even worse scar that I would’ve had normally?",1571863324.0,1.0,2

[Product Question] 15% Niacinamide + Zinc serum offered by Revolution Skincare... thoughts?,"I'm not familiar with this brand at all, but it looks like they have a couple of The Ordinary-like products available at Ulta.

[Skin concerns] Welding and skincare,"Hiya, SCA!

(I'm hoping I'm in the right place with this post, apologies if no)

Been welding for the better part of 2 years, my skin never seemed to react to it. I've always wore sunscreen and the proper gear/protective wear. *I dont think the problems I have with my flesh are relative, I mean. 

However, I recently started working with strictly MIG welding. Its dirty, smoky, hot work in a completely different position than before (I'm doing a lot of overhead and general looking up, covering less of my neck and lower face, I can see my reflection under my hood)


**told you that story to tell you this story**


As of a week ago I started to break out around my mouth. Strange, quasi itchy zits that have a lot of pressure. I, being the dumbass I am, squeezed them. Was able to extract most. Despite the immediate relief, there is hyperpigmentation that I'm sure I'm worsening every time I weld.

(Note¹ I wash my face at lunch •The Ordinary squalane cleanser, apply toner, moisturizer, SPF 30 or 40)

I'm not wearing a respirator, nothing is making direct contact with my mouth. I work in an air conditioned facility, so I don't find myself overtly sweaty at any point. Yes, I get dirty, but moreso on other areas of my face. I touch my skin as little as possible and cleanse during and after work. 

I dont expect a definite answer as far as to my problem but was maybe looking for possible insight, maybe something I'm over looking.

[Routine Help] Not sure if I'm doing something wrong,"Link to pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/4wVATcu](https://imgur.com/a/4wVATcu) (tried to make an Image/Link post but the buttons are greyed out for some reason :0 )

Hello!

My (21, F) skin’s been acting up for a couple of years, but about half a year ago it suddenly got a lot worse and it's been bothering me ever since. I started using my mom’s skincare products (didn’t have a routine at all before that) and they definitely seemed to help a bit, but it seems that no matter how much I moisturize, cleanse or take care not to touch my face, it will always find a new way or reason to break out. A few weeks ago I felt like I’d almost gotten my acne under control with the help of benzoylperoxide but then my face suddenly got super flaky and painful. It just started peeling off around the bottom of my jaw, edges of my face and all around my eyes. I assumed dehydrated skin as a result of overuse of products was the issue, so I completely stopped cleansing for a couple of days. I used ludicrous amounts of vitamin e cream to relieve the stinging and itchiness.... which eventually helped! My skin slowly got back to normal, but then I started getting weird red rashes with tiny red bumps going down from the corners of my mouth to the bottom of my chin. They would appear after finishing my routine, so I stopped using the cream and swapped out my mom’s skincare products for a milk cleanser + cleansing lotion combination that’s supposedly better suited for sensitive skin. I started using those but despite all that I’m now once again stuck with this stubborn ring of Gross around my mouth (as seen in the pictures :\^) ). Yesterday a massive cyst *also* decided to pop up on my chin and I just don’t know what to try next, so I was hoping someone on here might be able to offer some advice. Am I missing something? I listed my current routine below, thanks for taking a look!

Morning:

\- Take off benzoylperoxide from night before with cleanser, avoiding other skin as it gets irritated if I cleanse twice a day

\- Moisturize with “De Tuinen” Aloe Vera Day and Night cream

Evening:

\- Cleanse with “De Tuinen” Dead Sea Cleansing Milk

\- Repeat with “De Tuinen” Dead Sea Cleanising Lotion

\- Moisturize with “De Tuinen” Aloe Vera Day and Night cream

\- Put “Teva” Benzoylperoxide 10% on any pimples

\- I’ve been slapping hydrolloid bandages on the cyst on my chin but it doesn’t seem to have done much. I read they work better when it’s come to a head so today I pressed a warm compress to my chin a bunch of times to coax it out but that hasn’t done much apart from making it less painful, which is nice, but not what I want :(

Skin concerns: Acne around chin and mouth. Occasionally nose and forehead as well, but I can mostly avoid those by not touching my face and keeping my hair clean. Perpetual redness with slight bumps that sometimes turn into tiny gross whiteheads around nose. Weird purple blotches all over my face in general. Cysts on chin (although I haven’t had as many since I started using BP) and very rarely on nose wings. Greasy white bumps on chin that never go away but are generally only visible when the skin is pulled taut like in the bottom left picture.

Extra information: I already swapped out my old toothpaste (as well as shampoo) for one without lauryl sulfate and I think it helped a little! I drink lots of water and have been on birth control for years. When I forget my bc I feel like I’m much more prone to breakouts. I’m pretty sure I have combination skin cause my nose is a lot more shiny than the rest of my face.",1571851390.0,1.0,5

*Evening -* Micellar water, Drunk Elephant c-firma eye cream, Drunk Elephant framboos, Kate Sommerville wrinkle warrior, currently trying DE protini (on day 2- takes about 7 days to see if it will give me acne/milia)

[Anti-Aging] thinking about tretinoin for anti aging,"I'm 30 and have clear skin with a few little scars/discoloration from acne or sun.

This has been working really well for a few years and I don't want to mess with it, but I'm also starting to wonder if I should be doing more for anti aging now that I'm 30.

I read about tretinoin, would this be a good option for me? If so what exactly do I ask for, is there a percentage or something? I'm planning to just ask my regular Dr to prescribe it, he's pretty chill, and I read that you should say it's for acne scarring not for anti aging.

I had milky plump eyelids and now the inner corner is sunken, this cross hatch wrinkle pattern appeared on my inner and middle eyelids and the proper eyelid (above lashes) is so thin I can see the veins (which makes the skin look brownish). In the year that this happened the following things changed in my life:

* I changed jobs (air conditioned office, windows don't open)
* I lost maybe 5 kilo (which I am now gaining back hoping this will help)
* I had pneumonia
* I drank way less milk (now trying to go back to old dietary habits in case this had something to do with collagen)

Could any of those things have such a rapid effect on the eyelid skin? (I also have hypothyroidism) 

When I do the collagen test (pinch skin to see if the ""skin tent"" appears) the skin on my eyelids does form the tent for a while (my hands on the other hand not at all).

My skincare routine before this was Nivea soft and sunscreen and water (no makeup). I now got into topical vitamin A but can't say I'm seeing any results. I am willing to try some collagen procedures/treatments but what can be done for the whole eyelid (from eyelash line to brow)? I want my plump eyes back:(",1571828353.0,0.63,19

"[Routine Help] Help introducing Retinol into my routine. And general advice for young, pimply, menopausal skin.","So I have this lovely thing called menopause at the age of 25! 

h o o r a h 😑

This has wrecked havoc on my skin. It lost it's natural glow and aged quite rapidly in 2 years, due to lack of natural hormones, AND I have PERMANENT hormonal acne all over my chin. Massive, bulbous, scabby spots, that take 3 months to heal- by which time there's already been 8 new big old spots around it. 

Just a note, I'm not looking for advice on HRT management, I'm looking into that constantly with my gynaecologist. I'm looking for external skin care advice 💗

Current routine: 
https://imgur.com/a/sl2fpx9

It works well enough, I know there is no solving a big problem like hormonal acne like my case with just over the counter treatments, it's all tied into my HRT etc. So I'm happy enough. I use a spot treatment on any pimples that are MAJOR, but a lot of them make me break out in a rash.

Onto introducing Retinol. I've tried twice to introduce it into my routine, first a couple years ago with the Neutrogena retinol range. My skin burned, flaked, screamed out to stop, even with the lightest amount on every third night. So I binned it, it all seemed too much. 

Flash forward to now. 
I started on the ""Paula's Choice Barrier Repair Moisturiser with Retinol"", because I thought it would be a good, kid gloves start. I had no reaction in my skin but I assume that's because the dose of retinol is piss weak and basically like not using it at all. 

Three nights ago I used the ""Paula's choice CLINICAL 1% Retinol Treatment"" instead of the moisturiser. AND IT BURNS. I thought it would be a super low amount. My skin is peeling, red and it burns especially on my neck, under my eyes and around my nose. Is this something I just have to fight and get through??? Plz halp. Is there an easier way to ""get into"" retinol. 

Any help and general advice for my skin would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to look through my regime.",1571817062.0,0.9,18

[PSA] Please remember that aging and having wrinkles will NOT make you worth less than someone that’s young or without wrinkles,"I just read a post on here that said they stopped making big smiles because they noticed wrinkles around their mouth. Smiling is your right! 

Why is it that most of us sacrifice the joys in our lives to look younger? We will all age, get wrinkles, and die anyways theres nothing stopping the natural order of life. There are so many stressors in life as we get older and cutting off simple things like smiling and not being in the sun is just burning your mental even more.

After I discovered this subredit I get uncomfortable in the sun. I used to just walk to school with my face in the sun and it felt nice. Walking to school was a really nice relaxing time for me in the mornings. I used to not think about being in the sun, but these days my first thought is “sun BAD” and I am inside quick. Knowledge is really the devil. I’m trying to be less harsh on myself for being outside if I forget sunscreen. 

Another comment I saw said that they trained themselves to stop showing facial emotion at 18.....what??? Imagine spending the majority of your young and healthy life as an emotionless robot just to have 2 less wrinkles when you’re 40.

[Skin concerns] closed comedones or hypertrophic acne scars?,"https://imgur.com/a/PCoYu3h

I have these raised, flesh colored bumps that are only on my chin (and predominantly on one side). They aren't really rough but I can feel that they are raised. They have been there for years without going away. After researching I thought they might be closed comedones but now I am thinking papular acne scars. I never had issues with acne growing up until 2013 when I had an acneiform due to a clinical trial drug I was on for 2 years. I didn't get treated until I was off the drug but my face was pretty rough. I could have used this sub then! I know I have some other scars from that time.

Right now my routine:

AM- 
splash face with water
Retinol serum (tree of life)
The Ordinary Azaleic acid (not always each day) 
CosRx hyaluronic acid
Cosrx snail mucin
Ceravae moisturizer PM
Ceravae moisturizer AM w/SPF
 I'm probably weird for using both am and PM but my skin gets really dry, and the cerave pm is the only product of theirs so far I don't like. It gets gloppy on me. I need to find a new spf when I'm out.

PM-
Wash with gentle hydrating cleanser Cerave
Retinol
Hyaluronic acid
The Ordinary Lactic acid
azaleic acid
Snail mucin
Cerave pm

I just started regularly putting in azaleic acid, though I have had it for some time. I'm also missing my vitamin C which is a holy grail product of mine.

So really, I am just not sure how to go about this. I know it is hard to tell. I'm not even sure if it's worth it to see a dermatologist since it's not so bad. Any suggestions?",1571806418.0,1.0,2

I did have to dilute it a bit as using it at full strength made my skin sting like hell, is this okay?

Now my skin broke out recently and got irritated (not sure why) and I'm wondering if I should keep using duac even if my acne is gone, or if using the ordinary product will help, and also, what other products like this should I buy to combat my rosacea? (not diagnosed but suspected)

"[Skin Concerns] Favorite products to combat redness, scaring, and acne?","Throwaway because I'm pretty embarrassed by my skin. I applaud everyone who posts photos!

I need help with my routine, specifically what actives I should add to help get some redness, acne and old scarring under control. Mid 30s female and I feel like I can't get my skin to settle down. I went a bit overboard initially with trying loads of products and couldn't tell what was doing what so I scaled back significantly. I've been on a steady simple routine for the past few months without much improvement.

Skin type: dry, eczema prone, dealing with redness and acne scarring around nose, closed comedones and whiteheads on nose and chin with occasional deep dark painful pimples, dark under eye circles and some hyper-pigmentation.

AM- Rinse water or wash with Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser depending on how my face feels- Thayer's Alcohol Free Toner- Cerave Daily w/SPF 30- Etude House SPF 50 (if I am going to be spending time outside or if it's summer - I live in the PNW and work in an office, so usually I feel like the Cerave is enough)

PM- Banila Cleanse it Zero (love this for melting off eye makeup) or Garnier pink Micellar water if I am not wearing much makeup- Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser- Cerave tub

I've tried adding a few things into this routine:- Stridex Red every other day - Did this for weeks and no change- Pixi Glow Tonic every other day - I didn't use this very long but didn't see much change either- Ordinary Granactive Retinoid in Squalene - Have used once a week for 6 weeks with not much change, going to start twice a week

I've been toying with the idea of trying a different toner or adding different actives, specifically the Ordinary Azealic acid or Ordinary Niacinamide. Or is it time to see a dermatologist?

[Miscellaneous] A bunch of silly questions from a confused lurker.,"1. What exactly is a toner?  
  

2. How do you apply multiple layers of moisturizer without your face becoming an oil well?  
  
  
  
3. Why does every moisturizer I use give my face a shine or oily appearance. When I pass under a light it looks like I just ran a marathon.



4. How can people do ""contact treatment"" of their skin by leaving their cleanser on? I was told to leave it on for like 10 seconds at most, and if I leave it on for 60 seconds it sucks all the oil and moisture out of my skin and leaves it dry.

5. How am I supposed to use BP? Everytime I apply it it just dries the hell out of the skin in that area, and leaves a residue from the white cream. I'll use it as a spot treatment once and have peeling skin/residue in that area for a week.

6. When I apply a product to my face, am I spreading the acne germs around? Like if I pass a cotton pad with moisturizer over a pimple and then onto an area of my skin that is acne free, am I spreading the acne to that area?

7. Is it always a bad thing if a product burns, even just slightly? For instance a moisturizer with salicylic acid seems to me like it should burn slightly since it is an acid and it is supposed to enlarge pores. 

8. Why is it so difficult to find a good moisturizer? I have tried Cerave regular (made my skin tingle and slightly itch, made my skin oily at the end of the day), Nivea classic (way too heavy, made my skin so shiny), Clean & Cleanser moisturizer with salicylic acid (probably the best yet but made my skin slightly burn and sometimes tingle and itch slightly). 

9. When people say that their skin feels hydrated do they just mean shiny? Because sure if I apply like a ton of vaseline then my skin will be 100% hydrated but I will also look like a lunatic. 

10. Why is my face constantly itching (like tiny pricks of a needle, sometimes hurtful that last for like 10 naghing seconds) even though I applied a moisturizer? 

11. When ppl say they get acne on their jawline, do they mean like only on the 1 inch strip of skin along their jawline, or also like lower cheek/sideburns/chin.

12. Is it possible to get hormonal acne as a guy?

13. Can having shiny skin after applying a moisturizer clog my pores and cause acne?

[Skin Concerns] Am I Overtreating?,"I’ve been using Differin for 6-8 months now and rarely experience irritation.

It’s 2% hydroquinone plus glycolic acid, which I’m using every other morning. 

My skin doesn’t feel dry or dehydrated but at night my skin stings just slightly when I use Thayers alcohol free toner. The weird thing is, I use that same toner in the morning in lieu of face wash and it doesn’t sting then.

[Routine Help] How do I incorporate Pixi Glow Tonic and other questions. 27/F Pale ginger with light freckles.,"I bought a sample bottle of Glow Tonic and have been using it for the last 3 evenings.

My main concern is the small blackheads on either side of my nose and flakiness in the creases of my nose which is why I thought an AHA would be useful.

[Acne] Intense chin breakout,"Photos taken exactly a week apart. My chin has always been slightly problematic-rough texture, slight scarring, and the occasional cystic zit. Basically photo 1.

Then suddenly, with no change in diet, routine, lifestyle, etc., the below happens. I use a sulfate and fluoride free toothpaste (Jasons). No picking or popping. I am extremely committed to my routine even when drunk. Yet, fate is cruel.

Is this perioral dermatitis? Hormones? Slow-moving azelaic acid purge (started 1 month ago)? Do people even purge this badly from azelaic acid? Do I become a hydrocolloid bandage soaked in spearmint tea?

I hope to resolve this with topical meds but am open-minded to oral alternatives. I sadly have to wear makeup for work as I regularly see clients (just a light cc cream and lipstick).

[Skin Concerns] Skin Irritation/Burn,"Last evening before leaving work, I got a small chemical burn above my forehead. From the moment I saw it to now (almost 24hrs later) its still leaking clear water looking substance from there even though there is no real redness or burning.

I’ve talked to poison control twice, pharmacist, who sent me to ER Dr, Family Dr and 811 and non can figure out why its leaking water from it.

 They all say just keep washing it, don’t put poly etc on it. Dr said try milk or baking soda but I’m worried that will cause and infection. Tried poly now because I got tired of nothing happening, makes it burn more



Just texture change which is hard to notice and constant very little burning and water “weeping” from it (exactly like water not even plasma looking). Gets worst when exposed to air compared to kept dry under gauze/ band aid.

I don’t get how it could be the paint thinner/reducer/hardener as I’ve been working with these products for years and have had them splash on me before. They burn and cause redness and irritation that you won’t ignore. However this was so subtle when it was burning at work I didn’t think much of it.

Only other things that it could be is fibre glass (material or glue). Also I had pimples there, maybe some of it went inside that area? Especially after having gone to a RMT after shower and leaving the lotion on for the rest of the day, could whatever was there have created something and once I went to work on Monday it flaired up?",1571787715.0,1.0,2

[Acne] Seeking Advice for Chronic Acne,"I've had acne since I was 12, and have been going to the dermatologist since. I've tried everything-- every Rx topical treatment, every over-the-counter acne treatment, antibiotics, different types of birth control, I even went on Accutane for two months. Currently, my skin is worse than it has ever been. My skin is extremely sensitive after taking Accutane so my skin can no longer handle harsh acne treatments with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, but with a completely gentle routine, there's nothing to get my acne to calm down. I'm not sure if this is a hormonal issue, I feel like I've tried everything and at a loss for what to do. I only use clean towels on my face, I change my pillowcases regularly, I don't touch or pick at my face, I never pop pimples, I drink a lot of water, I avoid dairy, I wear sunscreen every day and am religious about my skincare routine. 

Right now my skincare routine is:

AM: Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser, Mario Badescu Rose Water and Aloe Spray, Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Moisturizer, Glossier Bubblewrap Eye Cream, and It Cosmetics Bye-Bye Foundation Full Coverage Moisturizer with SPF 50

PM: Bioderma Micellar Water, Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser, (every other night) Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA chemical exfoliant, Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief serum,  Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Moisturize, and Glossier Bubblewrap Eye Cream.

I used to use washes with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, use clindamycin, tretinoin, and spot treatments, but my skin was so inflamed, irritated, and worse than it is now. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I get new breakouts every day, but my skin is also very red and I have a lot of flat red marks where acne used to be which makes my skin look worse. I also have a lot of hyperpigmentation from my years of acne.

[Skin Concerns] Can you get blackheads from bruising your face?,"I honestly feel kind of crazy for asking this because it seems kind of ridiculous that bruising could lead to blackheads but I honestly have no clue what to make of my current predicament...  


Over a week ago I got hit by a ball right in the middle of my glasses on the bridge of my nose. I did a good job icing it and it was sore for a few days and was definitely swollen and a bit bruised in the days after.  


Fast forward to now, about a week and a half later. There really isn't much swelling (if any at all) but where my bruises were on the top of the bridge of my nose and the right side of my nose (where the bruises were) there are what appear to be blackheads.   


I am in my 20s and have never had a single blackhead in my entire life so I don't think they naturally appeared there. I didn't change my skincare routine or anything in the time after I got hurt so I am genuinely freaked out and don't know what to do about this. These things that appear to be blackheads in the spots where I previously had bruising have been visible for a few days now.

[acne] Has anyone taken their IUD out because of acne? Closed comedones galore (29/F),"I had been taking oral contraceptives for years before getting a Mirena. I broke out on my forehead (closed comedones) but was given tret/clindamycin and it died down afterwards. I chalked it up to transitioning from oral cont to Mirena.

A few years later, the acne has now returned. I have closed comedones all over my forehead and, during specific times of the month, the comedones become inflamed and painful. I also get cysts on my chin. It feels like braille on my forehead. None of it is terrible (according to my husband, but I suppose he has to say that), but I have never experienced this acne in my life (teens included) and it really hits my confidence hard during these times of the month and the discoloration from the acne has started building up.

I eat well, drink plenty of water, and take care of my skin. I've tried dietary changes (quitting dairy, etc.), hundreds of dollars worth of skincare, facials... some of helped but ultimately I've realized my acne is hormonal. I have great weeks where my skin is happy and then, along with bloating and the other lady-time-of-the-month things, my acne comes back.

**Has anyone experienced this acne with Mirena? Has anyone gone BACK to oral contraceptives?** I was a happy camper for a few years with Mirena but it really seems to be the culprit the last few years. I've asked my doctor to go back to oral contraceptives and she's put me on Junel to take for a few months along with keeping my IUD. If my acne improves I'll take my IUD out.

My current regime:

AM

Clinique Moisture Surge 72-Hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator  
Eucerin Sunscreen

PM

DOUBLE CLEANSE  
Acure Micellar Water  
Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Cloud Cream Cleanser  
Curology (just started, not sure how it's working so far? It is niacinimide, azelaic acid, and clindamycin)  
Clinique Moisture Surge 72-Hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator

Past things I've used:  
The Ordinary AHA/BHA Peel (the vampire blood colored one): I think I used it too much and it made my skin freak out  
Witch Hazel  
Cetaphil cleanser  
Cetaphil moisturizer (I used to use this all the time but have since stopped)  
Tret/clidamycin - I've stopped using tret, and I think it really ruined my skin barrier.  
I've been seeing a esthetician who is wonderful, although I really think this is hormonal and there's only been minor improvements.

"Why do dermatologists ""prescribe"" such expensive skincare products (or have expensive skincare lines that they recommend to their patients)?

The total price for the 3 serums  + derma roller that she recommended came to almost **$800.00.** 

However, I felt like this was a huge mark up. The derma roller she recommended was almost $150.00 (when I have seen them for way cheaper on Amazon). And this is something I have noticed at most dermatology clinics where they have ridiculously expensive skincare products. He also never prescribed me anything like Retin-A, tretinoin,

Used it for 6 days or a week

Product is thick and viscous and smell isnt very pleasant tbh so just add a drop or two of tea tree oil lol


Positives:
Never told my family i was using it and two different people in my family said how dark thick and longer my eyelashes and eyebrows were. Whoever is selling the idea that castor oil doesnt work for hair growth is bullshitting (but presumably to sell another non-castor hair growth product)
Can also be used for other things apparently such as stretch marks or dry skin if used in small quantities with a lotion

Negatives: Smell, thickness, use tea tree oil for relief from smell 

It does do what it said it would do. I advise you to get cold pressed castor oil which is pure instead of ones with other ingredients added.

The one step I always include is to clean my face with micellar water, but other than that I have no fixed order of things (which I am sure would make things easier and more efficient). Also I usually save the Vitamin C serum only for days when I’ve been tanning as I know it doesn’t help with the absorption of some of these products apparently. Aware of the Cleansers > Actives > Everything else order but a lot of the products I am unsure about fall in the middle so would appreciate any help. 

On a good day, my skin looks pretty alright except for visible pores around the nose area and blackheads on the nose itself once you look closer (wish the photo quality wasn’t this good):

&#x200B;

\^this is something I want to prioritise because I’ve had them since I remember. I was thinking of starting with the BHA liquid + clay mask? how long should I wait for before applying the mask tho?

Also, in the days leading up to my period I always get minor breakouts around the chin area which is super annoying, but for the first time ever breakouts like this on my forehead appeared overnight (which prompted me to go on a skincare purchasing spree):

[Skin Concerns] My skin is sooo dry and nothing is helping,"I live in a very arid climate and it's even dryer this fall. My skin feels tight and is flaking off.

Routine: 
PM: Wash with TO Squalane cleanser, then Micellar Water, then put Argan oil on my skin while it is still damp. Wait for it to soak in, then Cereve in the tub, then Vasaline on top to keep all the moisture in.

AM: Put water on face, more argan oil, then Cerave in the tub,  then SPF. 

Sometimes if my skin is really flaky I'll make a homemade scrub with sugar and Argan oil. I'm afraid of most exfoliators at this point because of dry skin.

After all this my skin is STILL dry and flakey. It's  hot, dry,  and windy where I live and it's just sucking the moisture out of my skin. Help please! I ordered TO Hyraulaunic Acid but I'm not sure if that helps in a dry climate.",1571770516.0,1.0,9
Timeline for negative reactions to new products? [Routine Help],"Hi Everybody! I was wondering if there is a typical timeline for when skin will react badly to new products?

This week I am having the worst break out that I've had since changing birth control. I am wondering if the moisturizer might be the culprit, but I have been using it for a month without issues... is this a typical timeline?

[Routine Help] Alternating Differin and Azelaic Acid?,"Looking for advice! 26F with sensitive, combination skin.

**Background of my skin:**

* Mid-20's Chinese, Male, Acne-prone + oily skin  


**Process + Results:**

*  For the first 2.5 weeks: I used only these products — oil cleanser, foam cleanser, physical exfoliator, essence, niacinamide, eye cream, benzoyl peroxide, brightening cream moisturizer, salicylic oil, spf, masks (clay/sheet), retinol( my skin purged for these 2.5 weeks, I also had to stop using AHA/BHA & Benzoyl Peroxide for a week because my skin was VERY sensitive) — my acne scars did fade out a little bit though.
*  2.5 weeks - 1 month: I incorporated the Vitamin C Serum into my regimen, at the 1 month mark, I did notice that my acne scars faded out more
*  1 month - Now(October 22, 2019): I incorporated the products — Gentle Brightening AHA/BHA Toner,  Pore Control Serum.  


**Some FYIs:**

* My eye isn't really all that great when it comes to seeing if my  overall skin texture is more even/smooth,brighter (this is kinda ironic and sad at the same time). Though I can see noticeable acne scars fading.
* My problems area regarding my pores is around my T-zone, nose and cheeks. I haven't seen much improvement in the appearance of my pores. (I know that you can't physically decrease the pore size). I did however see a little bit of improvement right under my lacrimal papilla near the top of my nose for both left and right.   


**The downs(problems?):** 

* After incorporating the Clarin's Pore Control Serum, I noticed when I nudge my palms together, (dead skin?) starts forming, this happens on my face when I nudge a spot as well. Is this normal? Currently, there isn't as much (skin?) that forms when I nudge a spot on my face now.
* After applying niacinmaide in my regimen for both day/night. I feel that my face is burning a little bit, this never happened before when I use niacinmaide.
*  I notice that the area under my eye (not really my eye area) is red . I can confirm that this is not eczema as it's not itchy.
*  Applying Benzoyl Peroxide after moisturizer burns a little bit. Then the pain goes away after 15-secs\~. This is probably normal right??

&#x200B;

**My question for you:**

*  Should I change anything in my day/night routine? 
* How long does pore-minimizing products have an effect on pores? 1 month? 2 months? 5 months?
*  I assume the skin below is my eye is a little bit compromised cause it's red. Should I stop my regimen for a week(basically just removing the actives\[AHA/BHA/Vitamin C/Retinol\]) until my skin is better?

  
I purposely didn't disclose most of the products I used. But if there is enough people who wants to know, I'll update this post with the product names.

[Sun Care] Will using chemical sunscreen over moisturizer ever work?,"Hey folks, I'm not a huge skincare addict but I've had a decent little routine for a couple of years that works for me. I've been consistently using the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50 sunscreen once in the morning at the end of my routine (hyaluronic acid, vitamin C 12%, TO natural moisturizing factors). I try and wait half an hour before going out but I don't always have time so it's 50/50 really. I was instructed by a friend who is super into this stuff to use it like this, but just learnt that it's a chemical sunscreen and is supposed to be applied before moisturizer. Will it have ever been effective being applied beforehand?

My second question on this theme is how often should I reapply? I live in a VERY sunny place (Denver), with bright sunshine most days all year round, although I spend most of my days in an office far away from the windows (it's not as bleak as it sounds). I reapply sometimes if I'm out all day over the top of whatever is on my skin, but obviously it is not practical to do this in future if it means taking off and reapplying all my makeup in the middle of the day.",1571762519.0,0.4,4

[Routine Help] Need advice about my skincare routine!,"I  have been visiting a dermatologist for over a year now, they had  initially prescribed me Tretinoin for my acne to use on a nightly basis.  I used it almost nightly (though I recently started to switch to \~2-3  times a week now due to it drying up my eye areas). My dermatologist  also recently told me to add on Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide in the  mornings. I was told to use it was a spot treatment rather than applying  it all over my face.

My main  question regarding this is, having used Tretinoin for nearly a year, and  adding on Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide, how long should I be on  these creams, is this essentially a life-time kind of commitment? In  terms of moisturizing to combat the dryness, I have used Cerave PM (in  the mornings) and some generic Nivea cream, but I am also open to other  cheapish alternatives!

And  finally, I don't necessarily have dry hands, but during the winter  months it does get flakey and sometimes cracks develop near the nails. I  have used Cerave in the tub to moisturize my hands, and while I do  think it is okay, is there other alternative options that work best for  hands moisturizing? Or would using Cerave be good enough? I have seen  folks in the past use Lubriderm, Aveeno and so forth.

- some nights I use the khiels cannabis sativa seed oil herbal concentrate. I got as a free sample and I’m liking it so far. It claims to help with redness, hydration, and helping the skin’s barrier protect itself
- I tried The Ordinary’s niacinamide + zinc and it made me break out. Did some research and it’s rare but some people can be allergic to it
- I used to use witch hazel toner and this is what I believe caused the redness in my skin
- I always remove makeup before exercising 
- I drink plenty of water and eat healthy for the most part 
- change my pillowcases every 3-4 days 
- I take birth control which has helped over the years with acne - I used to get a lot of cystic acne

[Miscellaneous] A Very Comprehensive Guide to Vetting Products Before Purchase!,"With ~~Drunk Elephant~~ (whoa little Freudian slip there), er ***Sunday Riley*** recently being [gently scolded by the FTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dl7ca6/miscellaneous_the_ftc_said_sunday_riley_faked/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for fake reviews on Sephora’s website, I’ve seen a lot of confusion and doubt about how to actually find legitimate reviews for products online. I consider myself to be a Jedi Knight in the fine art of Googling and whatever the Jedi equivalent of a Black Belt is in cutting through bullshit, and have honed and crafted my vetting process over many moons of… Googling and cutting through bullshit. Man sometimes a sentence just doesn’t end with that bang you imagined.

I thought I’d share my steps here so you can grab and pick out what you will, and hopefully feel a little less overwhelmed by the fact that everything you read is probably a lie!

**Overview** of the steps I'll cover below in far more detail-

1. Look at what it's supposed to do and throw ingredients list into Cosdna
2. Look only at negative reviews; filter from lowest to highest rated. Ignore 4/5 star reviews
3. Use Google to search for reviews from many different sources (i.e. Google ""{{Product Name}} Reviews"")
4. Get sample if possible; Buy smallest size possible

&#x200B;

**Phase One: Basic Recon** *Oh that product has piqued my interest! What fine retailers might I purchase it at?*

Sometimes I’ll come across a product that has a *je ne sais quoi* about it. Let’s take a real life example from those naughty little review fakers at Sunday Riley and use their Good Genes as our product to research. Few products have been as mega-hyped as Good Genes because *Oprah* loved it and she’s still a thing (maybe? Didn't OWN flop?) and it took off from there. So you'd start with knowing a few things about yourself and what you're looking for.

1. Skin Type (I'm Oily-to-normal)
2. Main Concern you're looking to address with this product (I'm looking to combat acne and large pores + even out my skin tone)
3. What you're comfortable spending (I'm Mid-range to High-end: Not super concerned about a price tag if it’s gonna work. But like not Barbara Sturm $300 for freaking Hyaluronic Acid expensive. We'll call that ""stupid expensive"".)

So let's say I’m all starry-eyed over Good Genes because I got a little short changed on legit good genes and if *The Secret* taught me anything it’s that I bring into my life what I desire. I want good genes so maybe this is the Universe being like- “Hey, I dropped some shit off at Sephora for you.” I first will go to the product's page at Sephora and take a look at two things: the product’s claims and its ingredients.

[Good Gene's Sephora Page](https://www.sephora.com/product/good-genes-all-in-one-lactic-acid-treatment-P309308?skuId=1418581&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939500_pla-419039569134_1418581_257731947995_9029600_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsfGr0eOu5QIVdB-tBh1d3QRzEAQYASABEgJZH_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

So for Good Genes we have the following on it's ""About Me"" section:

""**What it is:** An all-in-one AHA treatment, powered by lactic acid, that clarifies, smooths, and retexturizes the appearance of skin.

**Skin Type:** Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily

**Skincare Concerns:** Fine lines and wrinkles, Pores, Dark spots""

Ok, all of that sounds great and just what I’m looking for- so far so good. If that doesn't sound like what you want from a product just bail at this point. Also, please never put any stock in the “Clinical Results” section of the page that a lot of websites have. Go ahead and read the results for Good Genes and you'll see what I mean.

Now I move on to the ingredients. I usually do a spot check on how far down any of their key ingredients are depending on the product (i.e. if it’s a serum or a moisturizer), but the most important part here for me is to throw the ingredients into Cosdna and see what pops out. I don’t put *huge* stock in comedogenic ratings, but I still want to know if there are any potentially acne-causing ingredients right up top. Likewise with irritants. **Note on Cosdna**: DO NOT TRUST THE PRODUCTS ALREADY IN COSDNA! Ever notice there are like 15 versions of popular products in the Cosdna database and all are like, 1-5 ingredient different from each other? Do **NOT** trust people to copy + paste properly. Not to mention companies change their formulations preeeetty frequently. No, take the time to copy the ingredients from the store's website (bonus points for hitting both the company’s website *and* the retailers, because if there is a formulation change it’ll always be live for the company first- retailers can be slow to update) and paste them into Cosdna’s “analyze ingredients” section. [http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php)

So for Good Genes there is nothing I’m super jazzed about, and there are quite a few possibly comedogenic ingredients + a lot of fancy schmancy extracts (*Lady’s Slipper Orchid Extract?! Give me a f-ing break)* that I’m sure are like only grown on the Isle of Man and harvested by nubile young women after a milk bath or something bizarre. Given that there are a lot of potential acne triggers I’m going to be on the lookout for this in reviews. And feel free to tag in for my example of ""acne"" whatever your particular bête noire is. If you have dry skin and a product has ingredients like alcohol and you’re like 'oh hey that’s drying' then you’ll be watching for that in reviews.

&#x200B;

**Phase Two: The Reviews** *Reading how much people hate things and getting a lesson in how amazingly awful everyone’s spelling and grammar has become!*

Now the fun part, let’s read some reviews! I am now going to share with you my secret to getting the deets on products, right after I tell you about Skillshare! Ha. Ok my secret: I don’t give two shits, or even *one* shit, about the positive reviews. I don’t care that someone thinks Good Genes is awesome. I mean frankly Oprah already told us it was awesome so if you think you’re better then Oprah then you’re stupid and wrong. No matter what site I’m on the first thing I do is filter by “Lowest to Highest Rating.” (Side note: Ever wonder how to spot a fake review from a mile away without needing some computer to do the work? Ever notice how the 5 star reviews are always beautiful, ripe, lusciously complete sentences while the 1 stars are like “this waz trash i hat it awful!!!!” If a review *sounds* polished and put together it most likely was.) In the negative reviews what we are looking for are people with a similar skin type as ours and similar problems they're trying to address. You can pretty easily weed out the people who were hoping for miracles from a product or had an issue with areas outside the formula (company’s customer service, product size, product bottle, etc.) and focus in on those that could apply to you. Let’s snag up a good example for Good Genes from someone that seems to match my skin concerns:

>""Kind of bummed...  
>  
>I wanted so badly to love this. After all the hype and reading all the articles and reviews, I thought this would be magical. I used this faithfully as directed for two months and never noticed a difference in my skin. Nothing seemed brighter, smoother, tighter, etc. I actually stopped using it entirely after the two months because it really broke me out the whole time. I know some said there’s a “purging” period so I kept using it, but no purging period lasts two months. I usually have decently clear skin and this is the only item I changed in my routine that whole time. I gave the rest away to a friend who wanted to try it and hopefully they have better results.”

So honestly Good Genes isn’t sounding too bad after looking through a ton of bad reviews. Mostly people complaining about the smell which like if I can be blunt with you I’d probably put dog poo on my face if I would wake up with perfect skin- call me crazy. A few people reporting breakouts but some sound to me like purging. Ok Sunday, I’m intrigued.

&#x200B;

**Phase Three: Surfing the Web** [*Tubular! Oh shit remember Johnny Tsunami?*](https://images.app.goo.gl/E6Mtr2ncQY5bhxEb7)

Alright, the reviews didn’t turn us off and the ingredients are somewhat promising, so now comes what we'll call ‘casting a wider net’ since we're looking further around the inter***net!*** Ha. **Pro-tip**\- pretend no website ever has built in searching. I *promise* you it’s not as good as Google. Take freaking Reddit for example: ever used Reddit’s dumpster fire of a search feature?! Just use Google. First place I go to look for more reviews and info on a product is usually Reddit, so in this case I’d go to Google and type in “Sunday Riley Good Genes Reddit”. I always start more generic and add in words as necessary- like if I needed to add “reviews” on the end to get better results. Now I start picking through it all!  [As you can see here,](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&oq=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.5681j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) there are MANY posts talking about Good Genes already so you’ll find out a lot about it from reading through them.

For products that are perhaps newer or just less well known, you might find you’ll need to branch out from Reddit. In this case we’d just amend our previous Google search to read “Sunday Riley Good Genes Review”. There are a fair few review sites out there (i.e. Influenster) as well as personal blogs that might have tried and reviewed the product. On sites like Influenster same rules apply- ignore positive reviews and sort by lowest to highest. Oh also **IGNORE AMAZON**! To be frank I never buy skin care off of Amazon (or TJ Maxx/Marshalls for that matter), and I would especially never buy something that’s not licensed to be sold on Amazon because the chances of it being a fake/tampered with/expired are around 100%. If you’re ever finding yourself purchasing something and it’s cheaper than retail price just walk away. Therefore Amazon’s reviews are useless, because these are people reviewing what is likely not the real product.

“What if my product is *brand* new or so obscure I can’t find reviews on it?”

If it’s brand new I’d suggest looking at similar products from that company if possible to get a feel for them. Unless you *KNOW* a particular ingredient set is exactly what you’re looking I'd advise waiting it out on new products or at the very least getting a sample. My skin is not something I enjoy being adventurous with (but I also said like 3 paragraphs up something about dog poop on my face? so I think I undercut my point here). If a product is not new, and you *still* can’t find *ANYTHING* on it I would: **MAKE SURE THE COMPANY IS LEGIT**!

I have seen a lot of posts recently about people buying 'Provence Beauty' from TJ Maxx. I tried to help someone verify one of their products and couldn’t find ANYTHING on it. The brand themselves seems sketchy at best, and there is not a trace of any of the products that people purchased from TJ Maxx online. If the company seems iffy, *DO NOT BUY SKIN CARE FROM THEM!* It’s not worth it guys. If the company is legit, but just not very mainstream, you might have to go fishing a bit. I had this experience with Renee Rouleau’s products. This is the only time I actually *ask* a question in the Skin Care subreddit because you can find so much by just searching old posts. In this case I’d recommend heading to the Daily Questions thread and asking if anyone has ever tried {{product\_name}}. If you can’t find anyone who has used it, and the company doesn’t do samples, make positively sure they do full refunds (and include return shipping!) because it’s always a gamble.

**Phase Four: I want that.** *<——- Napoleon Dynamite reference! Anyone? WTF that movie came out in 2004 Jesus Christ!*

Ok so at this point you’ve probably made up your mind one way or another about a product and are ready to move forward. Often I find that my original product search has turned me on to a similar product and I am therefore performing this complex mating ritual with several products simultaneously before selecting the most dominant.

Once I have one I’m serious about your first question should be “Can I get a sample?” Ok guys here is the shitty thing with samples of Skin Care- using something for like three days in a row isn’t going to affect you dramatically one way or the other *unless* you have extreme sensitivities. However it *will* help you weed out little things like texture, smell (lol god smell again), feel (too greasy? too oily?), and how it plays with your other products (i.e. pilling). I always get a sample before I buy something if at all possible. Now if it’s *not* possible due to the availability (online only) or the packaging of the product, I’d recommend seeking out a travel size. Funnily enough this is exactly what I did with Good Genes (my take on it? Like basically the skin care equivalent of the shrugging emoji). I found my biggest problem was I’d buy a full-size product since it’s a bEtTeR vAlUe and then never ever finish it because I’d get right past that point of no return (like literally, can’t return it anymore) and then decide it wasn’t doing it and thank you next it (as someone hovering around 30 I can truthfully say I’ve never even heard that song which you can probably tell). So the hierarchy of purchasing goes: **Sample —> Travel-size —> Smallest size available** ***from the store with the best return policy!***

Sephora has a pretty fantastic return policy, so they’re usually my default. Oh Ulta too. I have this weird snobbish thing about Sephora being somehow better than Ulta? **If you are buying online** be diligent about checking return policies! With skin care you need to find out the following:

* How long do I have to return?
* Can I return open and/or used product? Is it unconditional or based on their discretion?
* Does the company pay for my return or will return shipping be deducted from my refund?
* Is this site well known and liked?

For that last point I’d recommend a similar vetting process as the one you just went through for the product itself. For ‘mainstream’ sites like Sephora, Dermstore, major department stores, etc. (lol Ulta didn’t make the list again! Maybe it’s the orange? Is orange just not classy enough?) you can do a spot check of reviews for their customer service, but on the whole this is going to be far more important for niche sites, smaller companies, and Korean/International beauty sites! Doing a Google search for, say, “Yesstyle reddit reviews” or some combo of that will net you most everything you need to know. Once again if you can’t find *anything* on a company I’d steer clear. If you find a product that is still being manufactured (like Good Genes) and it’s cheaper on the website you're looking at then it normally retails for then *it is cheaper for a reason!* Now companies do have sales, so if Neiman Marcus has 15% off skin care or whatever that’s different, but on the whole if some random seller on eBay is selling Good Genes for $30 that’s not a good deal, that’s herpes. Or hepatitis or.. something idk diseases I guess.

Note on Product Returns: I mean obviously as with most things in life the 11th commandment of “Don’t be a dick” applies here and you shouldn’t abuse company’s return policies. I frankly don’t really give a shit about a company’s bottom line so much as it’s just a huge waste of time and resources. But that said if you’re on the fence about a product after a week or so *RETURN IT!* I have done this with many products that I just wasn’t crazy about (lookin at you Protini) and have never regretted and/or repurchased anything yet. You WILL regret keeping around lackluster products.

Actives do create another can of worms with regards to purging and how long you should wait it out, and honestly I could write another post just about purging. Despite some controversy in my super important opinion purging is most definitely a **Thing**. To be *super* brief about it and distill this down to the key points to ask yourself when you’re thinking “Is this a purge or a breakout?” I would have to say it hinges upon two factors: **Where am I breaking out** and **what do the pimples look like**. Ooh I’m going to make a FLOW CHART!

[(Link to said flow chart on Imgur if you want to look at it in Imgur I gues)](https://imgur.com/c06E8vG)

&#x200B;

Ok that’s a lot of info so I’ll stop there. Notice I didn’t ask my friends about products they use because A. I don’t have any friends and B. Unless they have very similar skin it’s not really going to matter, but you could always include a ‘human contact’ portion of the vetting process if that’s your thing. Let me know if you have any questions about any of this as, I know vetting products can be really overwhelming for some people and I’d love to help you feel more secure in your purchases and find products that will actually work for you!

[acne] Can someone help me out with what may be causing this whiteheads/pustules? not sure what they are,"Hi All!

I seem to be waking up with a couple whiteheads every morning usually around my mouth but sometimes on my chin too. I have very dry/dehyrdated skin so I am currently only using cleanser and moisturizer. So there are a couple of things I am speculating

\-Skin is dehydrated and these are a result of dehydration

\-clogged pores due to the fact I am not using any topicals

\-Perioral Dermatitis

\-Hormonal Outbreak

Does anyone else have these and would like to recommend how I get rid of them? if a topical then would prefer something not horribly strong so it doesn't mess with my skin barrier. I am going to get a hydra facial on Friday to get rid of some redness and hopefully these whiteheads.

I’ve been using PC 2% bha and 8% aha every night for a while now to clear 20 years of huge sebaceous filaments on my nose without much improvement (as well as OCM and increasing hydration and moisture). I upped the bha 2 nights ago to PC 4% and my SFs are darker and more noticeable. Does congestion go thru a purging process like acne? I got 4 ugly zits in normal places that are already healing so I am purging a little, but the look of my pores...? Is it normal for SFs to get a little worse before better?  The rest of my face is responding nicely with a minor purge and no dehydration. And (yay!!!) a 6 month old blackhead I’ve been trying to extract practically fell out of my face within 8 hours of using the 4%. But the SFs look a tad worse and I’m concerned.

[routine help] Help me create a routine from a basically nonexistent one?,"Routine creation help

Hi friends, this is my first post to skincare addiction after scouring the subreddit for a solid 2 hours. So much amazing information but feeling overwhelmed! 

My current skincare routine is pretty lacklustre. I usually buy some kind of cleanser from Winners that looks cool and use that morning and night. 

I moisturize with Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Fluid in the morning, but nothing at night. 

Sunscreen is pretty non existent except in the summer months when I am on the ocean. I do use Shiseido Urban Environment Tinted UV Protector minimally - once a week at best. 

I used to use Lierec Paris High Peel and that banished my flakes but didn’t seem to cause any redness or issues. I can’t find the product anymore. Womp. 

Skin type is dehydrated oily. It’s gross. I have flakey skin between my brows, on my nose and sometimes on the sides of my chin. My forehead and nose are usually quite slick and I do have the odd breakout but I wouldn’t say I’m acne prone. 

I would love to be rid of the flaky skin and tame the oil down a bit and really just all around take care of this face. 

Can anyone recommend a starting point to a routine that could combat my issues? I don’t have a budget, and am willing to spend good money on quality product but obviously don’t mind cheaper products that work, too.

[acne] [product question] how do I clear my fungal acne??,"Okay, so first I want to start off my saying I have gone to the derm and been diagnosed with fungal acne! Since then, I have tried 2% keto cream, lotrimin ultra, stridex, clean and clear toner with SA, happy cappy zinc shampoo (which I found helps a little bit, but I’ve been using it for a month and my forehead still has hundreds of bumps on it and it’s showing no sign of improvement, just staying the same.) I’ve used econazole nitrate (which I’m using with my happy cappy shampoo and I don’t think it’s helping at all, but it’s also not making it worse so I’m continuing to use it.) and I’ve used sulfur which doesn’t work for my skin at all and made it look awful. 
I’ve tried Avène cleansing foam and it made my skin breakout. And I’ve tried the hada labo skin plumping gel which also made my skin breakout.
My current routine is vanicream cleanser, happy cappy shampoo, garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream, then econazole. (I’ve been on this routine for a month now and it’s now clearing.) 
I’ve been on an oral anti fungal for a month now, with no signs of clearing. And I’ve been taking a zinc supplement, which I just quit because I saw no improvements.

[Routine Help] A Couple Of Questions About Oil Cleansing,"Hey Everyone!

I have been using the Oil Cleansing Method for a few weeks now and my skin seems to be reacting very well. I haven't had a serious breakout since I started and my skin seems to be healing better and faster. I just have two questions that I hope someone can answer for me.

1. A lot of people talk about double-cleansing but after seeing the results of plain oil cleansing, I'm kind of afraid of using normal cleansers again. I don't wear make-up so the only thing I usually have on my face is sunscreen, which an oil cleanser can remove on it's own. So if I oil cleanse with an oil containing an emulsifier that allows the oil to mix with water and rinse off, is a second cleanse with a gentle water based cleanser necessary?
2. If oil cleansing can allegedly remove things like sebum and dead skin cells, is it still necessary to do my weekly exfoliation?

At night I cleanse with African black soap, a witch hazel rose water toner and then apple cider vinegar as a second toner I guess, then occasionally an oil (Coconut, argan, castor). I've always used these products so I don't know why recently it's been an issue. But it seems like when I take a break from them, nothing bad happens and things get a but better for a little.

[acne] New change in routine,"[my skin today](https://imgur.com/gallery/s0eW08f)

All my life I have had very clear skin and probably only two pimples which went away very quickly. Then last September I started uni and my skin started breaking out - not cystic acne but about 5-10 spots on my face, mainly on my forehead and cheek and they left a red mark for weeks after they’d disappeared. I thought it was because I was very stressed at uni and not taking good care of myself - lack of sleep, extremely depressed and too much caffeine etc. 

In January I left uni and focused on myself and went to therapy, started eating healthier, used skincare for the first time in my life. But nothing really changed and my face always has about 5 spots, still on my forehead and cheek and now closed comedones everywhere. I’ve been through a few different skincare routines but right now I’ve been using a 5% glycolic acid tonic and Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising gel, with occasional overnight use of benzoyl peroxide on the bad spots. I also wash my face with soap in the shower and this has seemed to help a little bit with the amount of spots I get. But this routine has left my skin really dry and sore and obviously isn’t working on my acne.

I feel bad complaining because I know my skin isn’t as bad as what other people have to deal with but it really affects my mental health as my body image is low anyway. I’ve been thinking about focusing on rehydrating my skin and abandoning all the drying products - specifically I’ve been looking into buying the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturiser as well as some sort of SPF product (currently I use none which I know is bad, especially when using glycolic acid) and just sticking with these three products. I’m going on holiday in two weeks and I’d love for my skin to be better by then as I’m getting some professional photos taken.

Basically I've had acne for a long time but I've only recently been getting into skincare and I really want to start clearing up my skin. The acne on my face has been around since puberty (I'm 19 now), over the last year or so I've been struggling with body acne as well. I have yet to sort out a good routine so at the moment I am only using:

Clinique cleansing balm to take off makeup

Neutrogena Extra Gentle cleanser

Neutrogena oil-free moisture for sensitive skin/the one with spf if I'm going outside (I know it's only spf 15, still on the hunt for a good sunscreen and I think I might try some of the ones recommended in this sub!)

My skin type is combination and quite sensitive (oily t zone but also dry/flaky patches occasionally, thinking of adding in hyaluronic acid to hydrate). Not sure how much detail to go into but on my face and upper back I get quite big pimples though not cysts (so whiteheads I guess?), on my upper arms and thighs I get much smaller, really tiny inflamed bumps (doctor said this was acne mixing with keratosis pilaris, thinking of getting the Cerave SA bodywash and moisturizer for that)

I have been to my doctor and also a dermatologist who have recommended isotretinoin/accutane but I'm honestly terrified of the side effects. From what I've gathered accutane is only prescribed in the USA when things like antibiotics and topicals have failed, that's not the case where I live, I haven't tried any other acne treatment yet. I went back to my doctor and asked what other she options there are. She has her own cosmetic clinic on the side through which she sells products by a brand called Aspect Dr and recommended the [Problem Skin serum](https://i.imgur.com/JQ5X3Kn.png) and [AHA/BHA cleanser](https://i.imgur.com/9wuBQzJ.png). I had a look at the products and while ""all natural"" they are full of fragrance, essential oils, a bunch of citrus extracts... I feel like they would be way too harsh for me and am honestly kind of confused that a doctor would recommend those products, or is it just me? I'm kind of stuck on where to go next, should I try out the products my doctor recommends anyway, or just try and figure out a good routine on my own? I'm thinking I could find some less irritating (and much less expensive) products with AHA/BHA if that's the right kind of thing for me, or benzyl peroxide,  or retinol? Is it worth going back to a dermatologist (maybe they can recommend products)?

Honestly when I look at myself barefaced and see all my acne I worry that I should have just gone on the accutane, but then just thinking about it makes me anxious. I can always try it if nothing else works right?  Ugh this whole skin thing has been so stressuful. Sorry this post is kind of vague, I hope it made sense and any advice is welcome.",1571723826.0,0.5,6

[Routine Help] Which Amazon cleanser should I choose for oily skin?,"Hi, I'm new to skin routines, and I suffer from oily skin, closed comedones, and blackheads. I've done a lot of research, and narrowed it down to three choices. I'd be grateful for some help, what are your thoughts?

A. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser: This cleanser seems to have really good reviews, but I've heard that it can cause bad breakouts. 

B. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Face Wash Cleanser: Also very well-reviewed, though many people have said this cleanser is very light to the point it almost does not help your skin. 

C. InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Cleanser: This cleanser seems to have the most chance to really help ...or really hurt. 

Has anyone had any experience trying either of these cleansers? Do you have other recommendations you could find on Amazon?",1571718368.0,0.5,7

[Sun Care] Sensitive eyes and sunscreen,"hello from sunny Australia - sorry i am on my phone

i’ve been trying to religiously put sunscreen on my face but i’m finding that most sunscreens i’ve used (pharmacy purchased to be specific) have really caused my eyes to shit themselves. my eyes just sting like all hell and i get severe light sensitivity so i end up lying down with a cold and wet face towel on my head for sometimes up to an hour and then i just sit in a dark room.

i’ve found the only way to avoid the eye sensitivity is to avoid my eye area. 

sunscreens i’ve tried are:

Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ - i have eczema on my eye lids so the alcohol in this dries my eyes out more and makes them sting

Cancer Council Face Day Wear Moisturiser Matte SPF 50+ - my eyes burn and i am blinded and light hurts

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50 - burns like the CC 

Mecca To Save Face SPF50+ - this is the only one i’ve found that doesn’t sting my eyes but the price tag 😕

also not sure if i should mention but yes i am going to see a doctor about light sensitivity because it seems fairly severe if it causes me to react so harshly to sunlight. also i have noticed that this reaction occurs when i use these sunscreens.",1571715359.0,1.0,6

I’m a university student as well and take public transit.

[Review] LRP Cicaplast Mains: a non-goopy occlusive,"La Roche Posay’s Cicaplast Mains is a hand cream (sold in Europe and Canada), but lately I’ve been using it on my face as an occlusive with great results.

It comes out as an ointment similar to petrolatum-based products (Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe Ointment, etc.) but when it glides on, the effect is much less shiny than petrolatum and much less tacky as well. It also has somewhat of a pore-minimizing effect (probably on account of the dimethicone). When I wear this, my skin becomes so bouncy and plumped and moist, and it stays that way all day—signatures of a good occlusive!

I highly recommend this as an alternative to petrolatum if you don’t like slug-lyfin’. This works especially well as a day occlusive. I don’t find I need to use additional lotion/cream under it either, since it’s “hydrating” (water + glycerin humectant) and emollient (fatty alcohols and shea butter)—so this is a 3-in-1 product for me. Bonus: It has 4% niacinamide!

(Side note: I’m prone to breakouts and this has not exacerbated any problems for me. I’m one of those unfortunate people who get closed comedones from CeraVe-in-the-tube and CeraVe PM, so this may be worth trying if you’re in the same boat.)

[Product Question] First time taking birth control (Diane-35),"Hi!

I am a 19-year-old girl who has struggled with acne since I was about 15 or 16 years old. I've tried Tactupump/Epiduo for about 2 years but my acne has remained persistent :( Since my acne is always the worst around the time of my period (hormonal) my doctor wants to put me on Diane-35. I've literally never taken any type of contraceptive before or any oral medication for acne as a matter of fact so I was wondering what your guyses experiences were like with this BC?

Also, how long does it show results/clearing of my skin because I am visiting my long-distance boyfriend next week and I plan on starting the pill tomorrow. Will I have to wait a while for results to show or is it pretty immediate? Just curious to know what the experience was like for the first few days/weeks taking Diane-35...

Thanks in advance!",1571697269.0,1.0,7
[Routine help] Tackling fine lines around eyes and red capillaries/veins around nose area?,"Hi everyone!

I recently came across this sub and read all the available materials, and also tried searching the group for similar concerns, but failed to find any.

I am 24 y/o and for the majority of my life have struggled with fine lines under my eyes - moisturizing doesn't seem to help, as any product applied visibly creases around this area.

I also struggle with redness (broken veins/capillaries) around my nostrils, and ideally I would like to make this redness disappear so I could feel confident to go bare-skinned more often!

My current routine consists of face wash and moisturizer (not water-based, as those seem to dry out my skin!), and I would say I have normal/combination skin that dries out significantly more during the winter months.

I am considering introducing Vitamin C into my routine (as well as sunscreen!), but I would greatly appreciate any and all advice that would help me tackle the issues at hand.

What would you suggest?",1571697105.0,0.5,1
[Acne] Breaking Out w/ Differin After Moisturizing??,"I have been using Differin for 2 years and when I first started, I never moisturized my face after.
Within the past month, I have started moisturizing afterwards. However, I am also breaking out. I have tried so many moisturizers, but no matter what I use, I find new acne when I wake up. I can’t just give up on moisturizing. My face needs it.
I would really appreciate any help. Here is my routine in order: 

1. Clean face with Garnier Micellar Water on a exfoliating cotton pad.
Rinse off with lukewarm water.
2. Apply Benton Snail Bee High Content Skin Toner with a soft cotton pad.
-Wait until dry. 
3. Apply Differin Gel 
4. Apply Prosacea 
-Wait 1 hour. 
5. Mix together the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence and Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule.
Pat all over face. 
-Wait 30 minutes.
6. Moisturize with either the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream, Bioderma Sensibio Light, Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream, Vanicream, or CeraVe in the tub. 


I know that the Neutrogena Hydro Boost, Bioderma Sensibio, Soon Jung, and Vanicream aren’t fungal acne safe. However, I took Fluconazole a few days ago to see if the acne would go away or if new acne would stop forming. It didn’t, so that rules out fungal acne. 
The CeraVe is fungal acne safe, but also breaks me out and burns my face so so badly. I turn beet red after using it. 
The Differin should be preventing the acne from occurring, but it stopped working once I started moisturizing. What else can I do? Will switching to tretinoin help?",1571696868.0,1.0,6

[Routine help] how can I help my boyfriend (26m) develop a routine when he HATES skincare? Tips/product recommendations appreciated!,"I have been trying to convince my boyfriend to take better care of his skin with little luck.

He is not happy with his skin and I don't know how to help. I let him try out some of my Cerave cleanser, and he liked how it felt, but he always forgets to wash his face with it. He only washes his face with a very harsh microbead scrub in the mornings when he showers 😬

[Skin concern] Discoloured black circles under my eyes,"I do not have a skincare routine yet, i find it really hard to get read information about products, im sorry.

If it's an aesthetic flaw, is there anything scientifically proven to work on them? 

I know about eye creams but..it seems like everyone agrees that they're scams.

[Skin concerns] Can a 10000 lux happy light SAD lamp/light box used for an hour damage skin?,"I’ve heard it gives off blue light or uva(not entirely sure though I could be completely wrong)

[Routine Help] Not sure where to start! Help!,"Hi! I'm 33 and I have no idea how to take care of my skin properly! I've been diagnosed with mild rosacea and have been applying metrogel on my cheeks daily for approximately a year. In the photo, you can sort of see what's going on with my cheeks - bumpy and red. What you can't see is that there are little tiny lines, like wrinkles all over my cheeks but they're not regular wrinkles if that makes sense. It's like my skin is so dry, it's taut. I try to keep it as moisturized as possible but it stays the same. 

My doc recommended I use Vanicream products - I use Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser for AM/PM and Vanicream Lite Lotion afterward for both AM/PM on my forehead. I use metrogel on my cheeks for AM/PM. I also use L'Oreal Revitalift (I feel like that's a dirty word here lol) eye cream for AM/PM.

I feel like I need to ramp things up or change things or something because my skin is aging and I can tell and I'm really hating the combination of wrinkles and spots. If anyone has any helpful tips, I'd really appreciate it!

"[Routine Help] Moved to a new country, now everything is bad","Yeah, so, I moved to somewhere with much harder water and my skin is the worst it’s ever been.

Is there anything I can do about this or do I just need to suffer? I can’t afford a filtration system. 

Current routine: 

AM cleansing usually makes the sensitivity issue worse but when I do anything in the morning:

"[Routine Help] After a terrible breakout, I need help optimizing my current routine to fight PIE, dryness, and closed comedones.","Hi everyone! I’ve been a loooong time lurker (like, since 2014) and finally got the nerve to post. I hope I've formatted this correctly. 

**The issue(s):** 

I had a pretty bad acne breakout back in April 2019 when I went off Spiro to try more ""natural"" alternatives (bad idea). A few moves and job stress didn’t help either. Now, I’m back on Spiro and my skin has calmed down a LOT. I haven't had a breakout in a few weeks :) 

I also realized I may have some sensitivities to silicones, because when I stoped using my very silicone-y sunscreen (Cotz), I also stopped breaking out as much. My current routine is silicone-free. 

I’ve had fungal acne in the past—diagnosed by a dermatologist—so I also try to avoid fungal acne triggers as well! 

I need some help figuring out how to get rid of leftover PIE, deal with lingering closed comedones, and combat some dryness. My skin feels PARCHED right now and I haven’t been able to find a moisturizer that is silicone-free, FA safe, and moisturizing enough. 

Here are my questions: 

* Are there any glaring mistakes in my routine that may be exacerbating my skin concerns?
* I’ve looked into incorporating a vitamin C serum—would you all recommend this? 
* Do you have any recos for a moisturizer that is FA safe and silicone-free? I’ve thought about the Sidmool Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Sleeping Pack or the Krave Oat So Simple Water Cream to use at night. 
* Are there any other ingredients that I should try to incorporate right now? 
* I still have closed comedones around my chin, despite using adapalene. Should I consider introducing an AHA to my active rotation? Or switching to tret? 

**Skin type:** Combination–definitely more dry than oily with the season change though! 

**Location:** North Carolina 

**Current routine:** 

AM: 

* Cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio H20 or Dr. Eddie’s Happy Cappy shampoo a couple times a week (for fungal acne maintenance)  
* A few times a week - [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) BP short contact therapy on any active pimples (wash off after 3 mins) 
* A’pieu Madecassoside Ampoule for redness
* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid (not totally FA safe but it doesn’t make me break out) 
* Sidmool Madagascar Real Moisture Cream (this is fine, but doesn’t seem to moisturize very well)
* Sunscreen: A’pieu Soo Boo Ji Cotton SPF50+ PA++++ 

PM: 

* Cleanse with Vanicream
* A’pieu Madecassoside Ampoule for redness
* Actives (on rotation—I try to give my skin a break from actives at least 3 days out of the week): 
   * Adapalene 0.3% 
   * GOW Azelaic Acid 8% 
* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid 
* Sidmool Madagascar Real Moisture Cream
* Timeless Squalane 

I also take:

* Spironolactone (25 mg, morning and night) 
* HUM Probiotics",1571686238.0,0.81,1

"[Product Question] The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% reformulated, with storage new instructions","So I recently picked up a bottle of The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% from a Deciem store (it's been out of stock online forever). I noticed that it has a new ingredients list and it comes with new use instructions. Specifically, it says to use it up within 3 months of opening (old bottle said 6 months) AND it says to refrigerate after opening (old bottle said ""store in a cool, dry place""). This is pretty crazy to me. It makes it seem like the granactive retinoid is not as stable as they claim, if it has to be used up so quickly and also refrigerated?! Any thoughts on what the deal is here? Granactive retinoid (aka HPR) is supposed to be MORE stable than retinol, not less, and the only skincare products I've ever heard of as benefitting from refrigeration are vitamin C serums.

So what is even the point of using products that have HA in it? I'm aware that there's the claim that it helps surface inner-moisture, but (just one example) a friend's esthetician shared it makes her cystic acne clients (#itme) even worse.

So for my fellow dry environment, desert dwellers, and now heater-cranking friends, what are your HGs for HA-free products to combat dry skin?",1571667925.0,0.67,7

[Product Question] Snail Mucin and Carcinogens,"So great product...concern over the preservative for Cosrx.


So this product is instantly moisturizing and I love the texture and use it in conjunction with my other water based serums to boost thief effects. My issue is the two ingredients they used to make this product. Phenoxyethanol is a common personal care preservative. It is an effective bactericide and has recently been widely used to replace parabens, especially in natural products. Phenoxyethanol has been found to be toxic to the body even in small doses.
In order to create it, the known skin carcinogen, ethylene oxide is combined with a phenol (a chemical compound which is also considered a carcinogen). The process of creating phenoxyethanol may (depending on each manufacturer’s production methods) produce the dangerous by- product called 1,4 dioxane. The EPA has established 1,4 dioxane is a probable human carcinogen. The FDA describes it as being able to depress the nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea. The product’s Material Safety Data Sheet says that it is harmful if inhaled or swallowed or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The Chemical Toxicity Database lists that phenoxyethanol may cause central nervous system depression, kidney damage, skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness. If inhaled it may cause respiratory and digestive tract irritation. Japan has banned the use of it in all cosmetics",1571667580.0,0.5,8

"[Routine Help] Acne prone, oily skin Skincare routine, need help: Ordinary, Roche Possay, Hylamide","Hey,

i have been struggling with acne and oily skin for years now (I am male, asian, have scars from acne and 21 years old), and probably tried every skincare product there is, but I cant seem to find the right products.

This is my current skincare routine:

\- everything with an ""x"" is what I am gonna start using (just ordered them)

\- everything with an ""a"" is what im not using everyday but rather every 2nd 3rd day of the week, since I feel like it would be too much for my skin

AM

&#x200B;

1. Random Cleanser for oily skin
2. Poor Flush (x) (Hylamide)
3. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (The ordinary)
4. Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (x) (The ordinary)
5. Effaclar SPF 30 (Roche possay, though im not sure if I get oily from this, might have to try a bit longer. Are their SPF 50 products better? like: **ANTHELIOS XL,** LSF 50+ ?)
6. Poor Delete (x) (a) (Hylamide)

PM

&#x200B;

1. Random Cleanser for oily skin
2. REN AHA Ready Steady Glow (a)
3. Poor Flush (x) (Hylamide)
4. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (The ordinary)
5. Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (x) (The ordinary)

My questions:

&#x200B;

1. Should I add something with a vitamin A? (Retinol or Retinoid by the ordinary (Maybe: Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion)? If so, what are the differences between Retinol and Retinoid? I tried researching, but I dont really get it lol)
2. If I add something with vitamin A, should I stop using any products? In particular stop with ""REN AHA Ready Steady Glow""? I heard its not good to mix AHA with any vitamin a. If that is true, should I stop one, or could I do AHA in the morning and vitamin a in the evening? or both every second day and not everyday?
3. Is my current skincare too much for my skin? If I need changes, what are those?
4. Should I change the Effaclar SPF 30 with **ANTHELIOS XL,** LSF 50+ ? I feel like it gets my skin a bit oily, but im not sure, since I haven't used it with any moisturiser (it may be from my skin having no moisturiser and thus over oiling?), because it will arrive this week with the other products marked with an ""x"")

So recently my skin has been terrible lately and I suddenly have a break out of all of these tiny invisible bumps on the side of my face that could almost be pimples but I'm unsure. I have always had clear skin (no acne) but have struggled with diffused redness on my skin. I generally have a good diet, cleanse and use skincare daily but I am wondering if some of the following factors have influenced my skin problems recently and whether any of you could help me to fix these issues!

Over the past two months;

\- I hardly drink any water daily

\- mental health has declined and have been really stressed and down

\- stopped using acids before bed (lactic and retinol) because I ran out lol

\- exfoliating more than usual

\- sleeping regularly and eating well (no heavy meals, no candy etc)

\- drinking more alcohol than usual?

\- have been off the contraceptive pill

Again, my issues aren't acne, but I am horrified with the texture and how dry and tired my skin appears to be. I have an idea that my moisture barrier may be damaged and I'm thinking I should just book in with a dermatologist, but I would love to hear your thoughts.

Sorry for all of the info!

[Personal] Did I just burn my skin with The Ordinary AHA/BHA Peel?,"I have been using The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling solution for about 4 weeks now (once every week) and I havent had any major tingling or burning sensation or redness even in the first application. I have been using it for 10 mins.

However, last night, I applied it for the 4th time. And it didnt go as smoothly as before. I had quite a lot of tingling sensation but I thought it was normal and I kept the peel on for about 8 mins, by that time, the sensation was getting quite heavy so I washed of my face. The skin on one of my cheeks, where the tingling sensation was most intense had these patches with fresh burnt skin like texture. Slightly white and shiny. I washed my face off with cool water. After washing, there was much burning sensation or anything. It just looked bad. 

After about an hour or so, I checked again and now my skin was normal. Those patches had disappeared. So I went on with my routine, applied some Alpha Arbutin and then moisturizer on top and went to bed. All seemed fine.

However, in the morning, the areas which had burning sensation when I had applied the peel and had that fresh burnt skin after washing, are not turned dark red/brown. Its really worrying me now. There is no burning sensation or pain. These spots are just there. I have applied moisturizer and sun screen.

I have no idea what caused this sudden reaction even thought I have applied this peel several times before without any issue. Any help will be highly appreciated.

[Routine Help] Is there anything glaringly wrong or missing from my skin routine?,"My (26F) skin type is combination / dry with the occasional hormonal, cystic acne breakout around period time. I live in the UK, so dry skin is quite a concern of mine, and something I deal with especially since I use retinol in my routine. 

I am currently struggling with these small white head / comedonal acne around my chin/cheek area. I'm not too sure what this is from, and am a bit afraid of experimentally adding in or taking away from my current routine for the risk of making it worse. At the moment it's not at all noticeable (only to me and then others when I pick at it).

My primary concern at the moment is anti-aging. I am quite an expressive person and have started developing lines on my forehead and around my eyes from laughing. These lines aren't fully set in my skin yet, and I'm trying to prevent that from happening as long as I can.

[Product Question] Just switched from PC 2% bha to PC 4% bha. Experiences?,"Long time lurker, first time posting!!! 😊 I’ve been using PC 2% bha and PC 8% aha every night for 8-10 weeks to combat the SFs that have lived on my nose since I was 12 (I just turned 40 so like 28 years now). I’m not gonna lie, I was expecting a miracle cure and it never came. In fact, I’ve seen little to no change in that time using this combo. So tonight I started PC 4% bha to see if it helps more. Any experiences with this stronger formulation?  Or suggestions on my routine? My skin is quite oily, used to get dehydrated super easily, until I found my hyaluronic acid and moisturizing routine. 

For reference, my routine for the last 2 months (suggestions, please!!!):

AM:

Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash (I wake up sweaty so water won’t cut it)

Thayers Rose Petal Toner

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Serum w/Hyaluronic Acid

TO Niacinamide/Zinc Serum

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gel Cream w/Hyaluronic Acid

Sunscreen (still shopping around, I was never good about sunscreen until this sub) : Olay Complete spf 30, or Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture with spf 30, or CeraVe AM—don’t love any of them

Elf Poreless Primer and make-up (powder, no liquid foundation)


PM:

Garnier Micellar Water or Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Cleansing Gel to remove make-up

Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash

Thayers Rose Petal Toner

PC 2% bha (4% as of tonight) and PC 8% aha

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Serum w/Hyaluronic Acid

TO Niacinamide/Zinc Serum

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gel Cream w/Hyaluronic Acid

Rosehip Seed Oil mixed with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion

Every 7-10 Days: TO 30% aha/2% bha peeling mask

Routine has helped my occasional acne come to a head and clear up much faster, but hasn’t done squat to my SFs and blackheads. 

So tonight I switched to 4% bha...
I gave a squeeze to this particular blackhead above my eyebrow that’s been driving me crazy for months. I’ve squeezed this mofo 1000 times and nothing, nada, ZIP! (I know, I know, but it’s just the one and I’m gentle).  I seriously almost peed my pants when the damn thing came out just now. In 3 hours it went from a flat blackhead to a raised/pimple type blemish after applying the 4% for the first time. And a tiny squeeze got me this huuuuuuge hard sebum plug that was never ending.  Just crazy long, idk how that much was in there. And it’s been there for 4-6 months and never budged until I used the 4% bha tonight!!

[acne] Hormonal acne caused by egg donation/fertility treatment?,"Been battling with acne for almost 20 years (29yo now), but for last few years it's been smoother sailing, mostly just texture-issues and occasional (probably fungal) flare-ups. Things got tremendously better 2 years ago when I switched my contraceptive method from pills to patch.

Until all hell broke loose when I donated eggs a few weeks ago. I started the ovarian stimulation injections about 6 weeks ago and the collection was 4 weeks ago - the process is pretty similar to first steps of IVF-treatment, if you're familiar with that. For the last two weeks, my skin has been flipping out: deep cysts on jawline and both sides of nose, tens of small pimples in forehead - the whole awesomeness. I passed it over as fungal first, but Nizoral didn't help, which led me to think it might be from the hormonal treatment, even if it didn't start right away with injections. 

While I definitely do not regret donating, it kinda makes me want to call the clinic and ask them to tell the recipient parents (anonymous donation) that while my other genes might be great, I may have given their kid the worst possible skin genes. ""Just dip her/his face to snail mucin and send them to SCA when it's time"", haha.

Jokes aside, **has anyone experienced this with donating or similar treatment?** How long did it last and did you find some magical helping product?",1571650708.0,0.83,2

My question is whether or not it would be safe to use the AHA after using this face wash, or will it be too harsh on my skin?

I don't have sensitive skin and used the AHA once so far and experienced no problems.

In addition, since I experienced very little discomfort when using the AHA, is it okay if I were to use it daily (of course I will be wearing sunscreen when going out) as I really want to get rid of the hyper-pigmentation.

[Acne] red wine spot treatment wow,"It minimized my pimples so much after one use and made my emerging pimples disappear. It’s been three days and my breakouts are almost gone (it may have minimized pih/scarring but that might just be in my head) I’m impressed. I tried it before as a mask and it was irritating but its perfect as a spot treatment on a q-tip. Stings a little for few seconds. I’m not sure I can recommend it but I think it can be good if you have nothing on hand or are looking for something new to try and not much has worked. If you’re concerned about harsh treatments this would probably be something to give a try in terms of chemicals. It may irritate but it’s safe for most people when it comes to allergies. Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin folk I for sure misused it the first time but I know some people like to be extra about things anyway . I have strong non-sensitive skin. Proceed at your own risk. A diluted spot treatment may be okay for some. It worked for me it might work for you.

[Product Question] Can an OTC Retinol be stronger than Curology Tretinoin .009?,"I just received my trial prescription of Curology last week and have been using it daily since Thursday (recommended M-W-F but the low dose made me decide to go all in).

The formula is: Tretinoin .009% / Azelaic Acid 9% / Clindamycin 1%

Previously I was using Skinceuticals .3 Retinol

The only different I've made is the Skinceuticals I would apply fairly soon after the shower (still moist skin). The Curology isn't immediately after washing my face but I'll still apply a small amount of fluid to help glide the product on my skin (usually just the Evian water spray but have used a hydrating toner).

I am 32/F and was looking for Curology as an anti-aging/treating hyperpigmentation. I have a fair complexion with a lot of sun damage. With the Skinceuticals retinol I feel like I was making progress but wanted to try a Tretinoin product over the winter and see how my skin handles it. I've been on the Skinceuticals for 2 months now and still have been dealing with flakiness but since I stopped one and started the other my flakiness went away and I'm just assuming it's a weaker product. Is that possible? I was afraid of trying tretinoin before going on vacation later this week but at this point I'm already planning on packing it and continuing to use it daily.

Has anyone experienced this while trying curology since the starting % is so much lower? I already planned on asking to remove the clindamycin and am thinking to see if they'd either up the tretinoin or just go to the .5 formula in Skinceuticals.",1571610039.0,0.67,4

[Routine Help] [Acne] Antibiotic-related fungal acne? New products? What is wrong with my face!,"I’ve been on my skincare journey for a little over a year now. I saw significant improvement about a month after switching up my routine last fall and was very pleased. I maybe got one pimple a month around my period that would heal pretty quickly. 

Old routine:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel
* Rohto Melano CC
* Simple Rich Moisturizer
* Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 50
* Smashbox Camera Ready CC Cream

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel 
* The Ordinary Mandelic Acid/Stridex Red box pads (switch off between nights)
* FAB Ultra Repair Cream
* The Ordinary Argan Oil
* Vaseline (inconsistent use, only when feeling very dry)

Fast forward to spring 2019. I went on really harsh antibiotics for latent tuberculosis and everything was fine right up until I finished my treatment. The last month or so I went to Europe and started using some product samples while I was there and noticed a slight uptick in CCs on my forehead. I returned to my old routine when I got home but things just got worse from there. By August my forehead was a war zone, small CCs everywhere with a couple inflamed ones at any given time. After doing some research I thought this might be FA from the harsh antibiotics so I started doing Nizoral masks and taking probiotics to try to get my own microbiome back full force. My face would look improved in the morning but then progressively worse by the end of the day so I decided I would never know if it was fungal unless I actually changed my whole routine to be FA safe. What a pain that was. It took me about a month and a half to completely change it because I didn’t want to change everything at once to make sure I wasn’t reacting to any particular product, but this is my new routine (bolded are new products): 

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* **Banana Boat Kids Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50**
* **Supergoop!CC Cream Daily Correct**

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* **Simple Foaming Cleanser**
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* Stridex Red box pads (about every other night or so)
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* Vaseline (inconsistent, only when feeling very dry)

Sometimes I’ll do a Nizoral Mask on nights I don’t use the Stridex pads. I’ve been using this entire routine for about 3 weeks now and I honestly just don’t know anymore. I still have a ton of CCs on my forehead. The rest of my face is ok, a couple breakouts here and there but nothing compared to my forehead. It’s really only one half of my forehead too, which I straight up don’t get. I’ll have one day a week where I think, hm maybe it’s actually starting to calm down. Then I wake up the next day to new small CCs and some of the old ones have become inflamed. What’s really irritating is even after coming to a head and healing, the same spot turns right back into a CC that becomes inflamed again a week later. It’s really taken a toll on my confidence and I’m just at a total loss with what to do. Even before I started my routine last fall my face was never this bad. The only conclusion I can draw are the antibiotics but I’ve been off them for nearly 4 months now and been taking probiotics for 2 months and nothing seems to be working. Anyone experience anything similar or have any advice? I’m desperate!",1571602737.0,0.5,8

"[Routine Help] My skin changed so much, not sure what to do...","Hi.  
In the past 3 years, I have been struggling with acne and have tried different things until I found something that was kind of working. Recently I have travelled for +1 month to South Asia and then South-East Asia and because of the humidity and the high temperature, I have based my skincare on washing my face with a cleanser and applying moisturiser. I have been drinking insane amounts of water and a week into my trip, my skin was clear, plump and with a healthy glow. I am back home now, things are looking pretty good, with an odd small spot here and there, but nothing major as before. I am now looking to clear my face of acne scars and smoothen the texture, but I am not sure what to do in relation to my skincare as I am scared of using anything again as right now my skin is at its best, but also I am worried that if I don't use the products that helped me, I will go back to acne.

"using neutrogena alcohol free toner for years, seeking replacement for added moisture [routine help]","My face skin is thin, sensitive, and very prone to dryness. If it gets wet in the shower, it dries out and even gets flaky. This is with warm, not hot water, just running down my face somewhat. I've just been using toner and unscented moisturizer on it for years with okay results. There is still some dryness I feel like might be improved with a more moisturizing, still gentle toner, if I can find it. So far, I've just wasted my money. I have used witch hazel in multiple variations, as well as non-natural brands, and it all does bad things to my skin. This toner is good, but it does create massive shine (not oily just weird) and some dryness, usually on my forehead. 

Even when I did OCM, I seem to have broken the moisture barrier on my skin as it created many crinkly dehydration lines while somehow also leaving my skin feeling weirdly greasy and tight. I guess because it is so thin and sensitive, it can't handle much of anything without reacting negatively and usually those fun dehydration lines that cannot be resolved with moisturizer or oil. For years, I was doing fun experiments with various wipes, toners, cleansers, etc, and it all fucked my skin up worse. Reaching out here in case someone has similar issues and another toner worked better than mine. 

 Currently dealing with dehydration lines that i suspect is from occasionally using cerave sa cleanser (that promised to retain my moisture barrier) and my face often feels tight. Fun!

[Skin Concern] [Personal] Girlfriend lost it after she saw my neurotermatitis feet,"Hello Reddit,

I have neurodermatitis on my hands and feet. It’s much worse on my feet tho (see picture), although it really only comes out during winter but usually some cortisone creme fixes it. 

When my girlfriend (of 2+ years) saw my feet today, she completely lost it. 

She is really deep in the whole skincare thing and easily spends thousands on beauty products, cremes and what not. Her daily routine consists of 15 cremes, sprays, oils and anything else that allows you to smear on your body. 

I am fine with all that, I even pay for some of her products, lotion her entire body up every day (which obviously is a mutually beneficial thing since of course I love touching her, so I’m not complaining about that) and to be fair, she does looks damn near flawless. However I don’t use any cremes & stuff. I barely manage to put sunscreen on my face every now and then. 

Anyway, back to topic:
She told me my feet look disgusting and DANGEROUS (she literally said “dangerous”) and that I need a pedicure IMMEDIATELY(!) because according to her it looks like my foot is about to “fall off”. 

I think this is her skincare craze speaking and that she is overreacting. I have had this condition for 28 years and I’m fine, I never died from having dry skin. 

So please be honest: Do I really need a 60€ pedicure and is my life really in danger or should I just put creme on it like I did the past 28 years?


TLDR; Girlfriend sees my life in danger because I have dry skin, I think she’s a bit overreacting.

[Acne] $70 worth of Amazon gift cards - what should I buy?,"I participated in a survey and received $70 in Amazon gift cards. Now the question is: what skincare products should I buy? I'm leaning towards shea butter but not sure what else to get. I have hormonal acne on my chin that I'm constantly battling so any advice for that would be great (I have an IUD so more birth control isn't an option). They're usually cystic in nature and pretty painful. Nothing I do seems to help (I change pillow cases, try not picking, use salicylic acid, use benzoyl peroxide (not at the same time as the acid), moisturize, use sunscreen, and use a new face cloth each time).

Routine:

AM:

* Splash face with water
* Use either benzoyl peroxide or clean and clear salicylic acid acid astringent
* Unscented lotion + body shop shea butter
* Cerave AM for sunscreen

PM:

* Coconut oil for makeup removal
* Clean and Clear salicylic acid again
* Sometimes the Ordinary's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
* Unscented lotion + body shop shea butter
* Vaseline for lips

I used to have very clear skin on my forehead - never had any issues. However the past few months I have seen so much acne on my forehead and it taking a toll on my self esteem and I am really in need of advise.
I’m not sure what kind of acne it is, I feel like it could be Fungal but it doesn’t really itch.

- La Roshe-Posay face wash at night and in the morning
- 10% benzoyl peroxide Clean and clear wash in effected areas at night
- Clindamycin / Tretinoin gel at night
- Aczone in the morning 
- Vanicream moisturizer in the morning and at night

I’ve seen a few people recommend Nizoral and azelaic acid? I’m open to any recommendations

Edit:
Things to note: 
- started a new job recently and stress level has been pretty high
- derm prescribed Clindamycin / Tretinoin gel around 8 months ago and worked amazing for about 6 months 
- digestion has been off presumably from the stress

[Skin Concern] I think I messed up by trying Cetaphil and now everything I use makes my face burn.,"So it’s exam season and also beginning to get cold here in Canada, which means my skin has started to break out. I usually get a few pimples between my eyebrows, near my hairline and under my bottom lip. I work at a pharmacy, and one of my pharmacists there recommended that I try a gentle cleanser, namely Cetaphil. 

I gave it a go before bed, but about 15 minutes later I noticed my face felt very dry and VERY itchy. Checked in the mirror, and my face was red and covered in hives, and I got a small semi-circle of pimples and super dry skin under my eyes. Stopped using the cleanser, but the dry spots and some of the pimples remain. 

Now, when I use my moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel) or my usual cleanser (Aveeno Ultra-Calming Facial Cleanser) it burns like HELL. I stopped using my toner as well, L’Oreal Witch Hazel Toner, because it just hurts too badly. 

Also to be noted: about 4 weeks ago I was a dummy and decided to try a whole bunch of new products in a new routine without patch testing and also introduced them all at once. Something was making my skin very bumpy and red, so I’ve quit all of them and have only been using the products listed above for 2 weeks now until I tried Cetaphil 4 days ago. 
The products I tried were: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence, Sephora Vitamin C+E Serum, and LaNeige Sleeping Mask. 

[TLDR]: Started using a whole load of products all at once, something was irritating so stopped. Tried Cetaphil facial cleanser, dried up my skin and gave me terrible pimples that won’t go away and now my regular facial wash and moisturizer burns my face. 

Can anybody suggest a way to fix this?",1571540139.0,1.0,10

[Skin Concern] Oily scalp,"Looking for advice. 

29, male.

I've been shaving my head daily for over a year with no issues. I started shaving my head as my hair began to thin and I didn't want to cling to it, so I generally have a pretty decent regrowth by the next day. But I don't generally get any irritation or anything of major concern from shaving.

The thing that drives me nuts is the amount of oil that my scalp seems to produce as the day progresses. It's not a huge or ridiculous amount, but it's noticeable. 

On an average day I've shaved by 7am and done my skincare routine, and by after midday it it's like i've visited the [shin-o ball-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVrbq8TtTo0). Generally when I'm out, people are always touching my head, and it's a little anxiety inducing when they first comment on how oily it is. 

If it helps, I shave with a Gillette multi-blade, and [Somersets Original English shaving oil](https://www.shavershop.com.au/somersets/original-english-shaving-oil-35ml-005236.html). 

My for AM & PM routine is:

* Paula's Choice 2% BHA
* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (I've only introduced it this week)
* Hada Labo hydrating lotion

Today I stopped in Sephora to ask for some skincare advice and was introduced to Peter Thomas Roths products. The skin care specialist used the following on me:

* Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream
* Water Drench Cleanser 
* FIRMx Peeling Gel
*  Potent-C Power Eye Cream 

My skin felt moisturized, looked cleaner and had a glow to it. However, it was way out of my budget for the 4 products. 

I also emailed The Ordinary for a recommended routine based off of my skin and pictures. Here's the list that they recommended:

* The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser
* The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA
* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
* The Ordinary “Buffet”
* The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA
*  The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5

anyways, i never get pimples and i only have a few blackheads and my skin looks really nice until i put makeup on it. 

then you can tell how dry, flakey and parched it really is. 

when i find something that’s hydrating enoigh, it ends up clogging my pores and giving me a bunch of little bumps... i never win!

basically, i don’t know what to do and i’m just really stressed because nothing works. 

right now i only use LRP hydrating cleanser, Alba Botanica emollient sunscreen, Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream and Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base as primer. 

Those are basically the products that make things any better for me but even those are not enough hydration for my dry and dehydrated skin. 

basically, i need a lot of help and support and idk what to do. 

my derm. just suggests to stick to what I use and just not use makeup since that’s when it’s visible....but that doesn’t sound good to me.

"[Skin Concerns] Deeply congested skin whiteheads, blackeads, microcomedones but also very dry, damages moisture barrier?","My skin is very deeply congested my cheeks are very bumpy, skin has a grainy texture.  Lots of whiteheads, microcomedones, almost as if every pore is blocked. Some are squeezable but many are not.

I am a long time differin user. For a long time my routine was basic af. 

AM: 

Splash with water

Apply eye cream and moisturiser with spf 30

PM: 

Cleanse with cetaphil (sometimes use a mild acid toner - not on retinoid days)

Apply eye cream & differin (sometimes would add some basic moisturier after but mostly not.

&#x200B;

When I noticed the bumps and blocked pores were not moving I tried to repair my skin barrier with lots of moisturiers recommended here but the bumps remained and got worse even with more clogged pores. I also tried the fungal method and it wasn't that.

How do I unblock my skin, removing the deep clogs and bumps while at the same time protecting my skins barrier function? 

Do I use BHA, do I steam my face, use a mask, oil cleanse? Do I apply a moisturier before or after differin? How long will it take to see an improvement so that I know I'm on the right path?

Also what about vitamins and diet? I think my sebum is very thick and sticky so it gets stuck in the pore rather then coming out to spread over the skin which means my skin is both oily / congested and dry. I have read before about diet and supplements for this problem like taking certain oils to thin out you own sebum a bit or using zinc, vitamin a or B5?

How do I get smooth fresh skin?",1571513882.0,0.67,3

[Skin Concerns] What's Up With My Skin?,"I'm eight months post accutane and I'm beginning to break out again, so I'm left wondering just what is up with my skin because I never see anyone with a face that's similar.

My nose,forehead, and cheeks have large pores that when squeezed produce sebum, and are oily, red and blotchy, and by the end of the day have accumulated a layer of dead skin. They are like this no matter what I do, washing daily, not washing for months, all natural treatments, Accutane, etc. When I was younger they were much worse but have mellowed out a little since I turned twenty. 

Around my mouth is where most of my breakouts occur. Usually painful pustules that aren't just like like a red bump but are also surrounded by inflammation so that even a tiny one will cause a reddened area half an inch in diameter. 

I also have bad dandruff on my scalp and in my facial hair that is impossible to get rid of, nothing works and sometimes it becomes so itchy I bleed. Occasionally it's in my eyebrows and chest hair too. On the back of my scalp I get frequent painful bumps that weep and crust over. 


No derm has been able to difinitively give me a diagnosis. I've heard rosacea, Seb derm, adult acne, folliculitis, immune system dysfunction, staph infection... I've been on multiple routines and antibiotics with very limited results.

[Acne] [Routine Help] Nearly 10 years with different Rx by derms and STILL struggling,"*\~ begin brief new poster intro \~*

Hi all! I've been lurking SCA for about 6 months now, and am excited to join the community. I am (out of desperation) seriously dedicated to my skin, but it is quite mad at me. I have had two dermatologists (I live in two different states) both of which are at the ""IDK, add more retinol"" stage.

I've been told I have oily skin. I've been told I have dehydrated skin. I've even be told dry skin. Anything my skin could be, I've been told I have that type.

The straw that broke the camel's back was trying to treat for dehydrated skin and SFs. I switched to a LRP Toleraine Milk Cleanser and followed [Fifty Shades of Snail's SF Routine](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/) and this combination brought me 4-7 new pimples in 2  weeks. I got scared and jumped ship. ~~My skin scars easily.~~

*\~ end brief new poster intro \~*

Current Routine (literally hasn't changed in about 4 or 5 years):

[my face a.k.a my EVIDENCE](https://imgur.com/a/TuTBQTy)

AM:

1. SkinMedica Facial Cleanser
2. Obagi ClensiDerm Salysilic Acid 2%
3. Aczone (dapsone) 7.5%
4. CeraVe AM Facial Moisturzing Lotion

PM:

1. SkinMedica Facial Cleanser
2. Retin-A Micro 0.08% (yep, I was Rxed to use this every night)
3. Vanicream Lite Lotion

&#x200B;

With this \^\^ routine, I usually get 1 or 2 pimples every 2 or 3 weeks, but I can get really bad cystic acne (and had it when I was younger, hence scars) if I switch my birth control generic (my experience was from Camilla to Heather).

My face is tight after washing in the morning. Face is red after applying aczone. I historically have sensitive skin (e.g. eczema prone in the winter, stingy sunscreens, stingy sweat, etc.). We've always had unscented detergents and soaps in the house bc of yours truly :)

**TL;DR** I am desperately looking for a routine that takes care of my skin, because I feel like I'm obliterating it at the moment and the derms have kind-of run out of options.

[Product Question] Recommendation for thick and buttery rich face creams.,"Hey guys!

I'm on the hunt for really nice and thick and greasy and buttery rich face moisturizers. So far I've found a couple but none of them made it to my holy grail yet. I will list the ones I've liked and tested so my fellow dry/dehydrated folks can try them out.


- [Bareminerals Butter Drench](https://www.bareminerals.com/skincare/moisturizers/butter-drench-restorative-rich-cream/US78851.html) - so far this is my go to but sometimes I feel like it's not enough


- [Crème De La Mer](https://m.cremedelamer.com/product/5834/12343/moisturizers/creme-de-la-mer/moisturizer-for-dry-skin#/sku/26766) - I do love the smell. It is a little too cream cheesy. I like a cream that's more buttery and easier for skin to absorb. I'm running out of my first jar and Idk if I wanna shell out that kinda money again. 


- [Algenist Genius Sleeping Collagen](https://www.algenist.com/products/genius-sleeping-collagen) - I love everything about this cream but again that $98 price hurts


- [Cerave in the tub](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) - It does a good job but I don't love it. I feel like it sits on my skin for far too long. And even though it is fragrance free there's an odd smell to it, I guess the blend of ingredients.

peroxide benzoyl 10% - only use it during acne outbreaks

COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence

COSRX Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream - normally only use it combined with the PB

Hydrating Sheet masks when I want to chill, and The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Clay Mask when I need more than usual oil control.

My skin has always been too oily and I don't know what I can do to control it. Before COSRX moisturizer I used The Body Shop Seaweed Oil-Control Gel Cream, which wasn't really oil control for me cause I would still be shinny after 1 hour.

[Product Question] The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside solution 12% making my skin oily.,"Hi guys, I tried to find a YouTube video or online review about this but nobody has been talking about this. 

My skin is combination but has been more on the drier side past few months. I needed something to brighten my under eyes and area around my mouth. I went to the ordinary store and explained everything, they recommended me Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%. I've been using it for 2 weeks. I haven't noticed any brightening yet. But it's making my skin extremely oily. 

I only use it at night because it doesn't layer well with my makeup in the morning. I've used it different ways; right after cleansing, after cleansing and exfoliating and, after cleansing, exfoliating and toning. Regardless, I wake up every morning with oil piled up on my face. This doesn't bother me as much because I wash my face right away. But it's also breaking down my makeup. Everyday I come back home, my face is very oily and my makeup is gone from the cheek and around the nose area. It even breaks down my eye makeup. At the end of the day my face looks gross and oily. I'm not even using it in the morning. 

This has never happened to me before.  Sometimes in summer my face gets shiny at the end of the day but my makeup stayed intact. Plus it's cold here in Canada rn.

This is the only new thing I've added to my skincare or makeup routine so I can't say something else is making me oily. 

My skincare routine in the morning is cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. At night it's only this serum after cleansing. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Do I stop using it or is it normal? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!",1571492871.0,0.5,6

[Routine Help] Mature (early 70s) moisturizers that are fragrance-free / for sensitive skin,"Hi all!

My mom is 72 and asked me for some help choosing a daytime moisturizer and something to apply before bed. She hasn't really had a skincare routine before and doesn't wear makeup. Her concern right now is dryness. We need something unscented & fragrance free. She is located in Canada and we looked in London Drugs the other day but without being familiar with skincare terms it was a bit overwhelming navigating all the creams, serums, moisturizers, etc!

From what I've been reading, something like Cerave could work? If you have any other recommendations I would really appreciate them!

[acne] Can differin cause CC’s?

[Review] I Used St. Ives Apricot Acne Control Scrub,"I've been a member and lurker of this sub for over 2 years now. One of the first things I learned is the Apricot scrub is a big no no. It gives microscopic tears and it's HORRIBLE for your skin. 

This year, I saw more posts challenging the accepted notion of ""microscopic tears"". I also saw posts encouraging members to share their beloved skincare tricks that go against the grain. St Ives scrub was mentioned on that thread as well. As we all know here, YMMV is an important golden rule. For over 2 years, I've been afraid to try this scrub based on the memes, bad reputation, and shaming. I want better skin, not worse and we all know st ives is a bad idea, right?

So...a few days ago, I decided to try it. I just had to see the effects for myself. I have very oily combo skin. My breakouts usually consist of small cc clusters and then a couple of smaller pimples. I get them on my forehead and cheeks. This sub has helped clear my skin, but I still get break outs if I'm not consistent...or when I sleep in my makeup for a week straight repeatedly (I know! Bad me!). Anyway, I had a breakout and rough texture that was not subsiding no matter what I did. My usual tricks were not helping much. That's when I decided to try the scrub. 

The scrub is fragranced and smells nice. When I used it, I noticed how gritty it was so I used light gentle circular motions. I made sure I wasn't pressing down hard. My skin was already aggravated and I didn't want to make it worse with harsh force.  I really focused on my rough cheeks and then gave the rest of my face attention. It was surprisingly relaxing and fun. Around a minute or two I rinsed it off and omg, WOW! While rinsing, it felt sooo soft! After drying it, I kept touching it. Despite my recent bout of roughness, my face is usually very soft, but this was next level. My face did feel a bit irritated/slight stinging afterwards, but that happens with my Ole Henriksen scrub and power peel as well, so I knew it was fine. My face looked really glowy. The scrub did pop/remove the tops of a few smaller white heads I had. I applied moisturizer, rosehip oil, and then too cool for school's pumpkin sleep pack to my face and went to bed.

I kid you not, in the morning when I woke up, most of my spots were gone! The really inflamed pimples had shrunken down very small. I was shocked and upset I didn't take pictures. I didn't expect it to work. I honestly expected a horrible outcome. I use chemical exfoliation regularly and a couple times a week I use a small silicone face scrubber as a manual exfoliator with my face wash. None of that got me the result I saw with st ives. My luxe ole henriksen scrub doesn't do what I experienced with st. Ives.

I know st ives is considered bad on this sub, but if you haven't tested your own mileage, you might be missing out on something helpful. I'll probably use it once every 1-2 weeks. It works.

Edit: Apparently my sleeping in makeup comment for a week wasn't explained well. I was still doing a morning skincare routine daily/removing it. I'd just sleep in my makeup repeatedly for a week, clean in the morning, then reapply.",1571471459.0,0.87,44
[B&A] Accutane and Routine - Advice Needed!,"Hi sub,

I’m about to start Roaccutane to (hopefully) solve my acne problem and I was hoping for some product recommendations. I know that Roaccutane can have some serious effects on the skin so I want to ease these side effects as much as possible as well as enhance the treatment. The last thing I want is to suffer through months of side effects before realising that my routine is the problem!

I (19F) currently have problematic combination skin and I'm on birth control, as far as I know, my ance is not affected by hormones very much. My current routine looks like this:

**AM**

* Drunk Elephant Slaai Cleanser OR Cetaphil cleanser if my skin is feeling more oily 
* TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% 
* Sukin Signature Facial Moisturiser 
* SPF 30

**PM**

* Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes
* Cetaphil Cleanser
* TO Glycolic Acid Toner
* TO Niacinamide + Zinc
* Sukin Signature Moisturiser 

I also have started using the Aztec clay healing mask as I've seen so many good reviews, only been using for two weeks but when I do my nightly routine goes cleanser, mask, moisturiser. 

I know that on Roaccutane it's not great to use harsh chemicals or exfoliators... I've never had overly sensitive skin before so this is new territory for me. I will speak to my derm at my next appointment to get his advice as well but you guys always give such helpful tips too!",1571470910.0,0.5,2

[skin concerns] Textured skin plaqued with hard solid sebums in every pore.,"[https://imgur.com/a/89yhc08](https://imgur.com/a/89yhc08)

Every little bump or pore you see on my face has these often large hard-ish solid sebums trapped inside. Sometimes I'll squeeze a solid sebum so big that I'm surprised it came out of such a small little pore and I'd stare at it in amazement. Maybe squish it a bit. Could anyone tell me what's up with my skin? I would say I have sensitive combination skin. My T-zone gets really oily during the day but my clogged pores are everywhere on my face including my cheekbones, temple, and the sides of my face too.

My Super Simple/Boring Skincare Routine:

AM:

Wash with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic face wash

Moisturize with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic moisturizer with Licochalcone

PM:

Wash with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic face wash

Moisturize with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic moisturizer with Licochalcone

\--

I used to incorporate Acne.org Benzoyl Peroxide into my routine which helped me achieve 90% clear skin but with consequences of itchy red, dry, and irritated skin. I tried using oils in my moisturizer, or changing my moisturizer completely to the Cerave Tub (which I think is too heavy for me - more clogged pores) but no change. Every time I would stop BP, my acne would come back like clockwork and I felt like a slave to the company so I stopped completely. 

I tried Salicylic Acid (Stridex Red) but no improvements whatsoever, which is very odd.

I tried Urea. It only irritated my skin and made it red.

I thought it was fungal acne so I used Head n Shoulders as a face wash and Ketoconazole as a face mask. Didn't make it worse, didn't make it better. 

I just want to disclose that I hate tacky or greasy things on my face. If something doesn't absorb right away I feel really really **icky** and have to wash it off. It might have been something to do with me rubbing vaseline all over my body for fun as a little fetus when no one was looking, ugh.",1571467529.0,0.92,5

I'm super insecure about it so if anyone has any advice I'm all ears. Here's all the different stuff I've tried over the past 2 years:

-drink lots of water/improve my diet
 
-Exfoliating 

-It's 100% not my hair products (I have super short    hair and almost never put product in it anyway)

-Using a cleanser once a day/ twice a day/ not at all

 -multiple pore minimizing skincare products. 

-Mattifying primers and powders

-Ultra hydrating my skin with oil/thick moisturizers

-Gel/Water based Moisturizer

-Mattifying Moisturizer

-Witch hazel toner

-Facial Mist

-Hydrating Face Masks

-Using Oil blotting paper

-Not using oil blotting paper (I read somewhere they make more oil appear???)

-Tretinoin Cream

- Adapalene

-Clindamycin

[Personal] Having a self-care night and triple masking. Feels good. 🤗,"For anyone interested in my actual routine (once weekly), here it is:

1. Warm shower to clean both face and body, while enjoying some nice steam to soften oils
2. Swipe some Stridex (red box) over my face and let it sit until neutralized
3. Moisturize body with CeraVe SA cream, get dressed
4. Rinse Stridex off (I have sensitive skin and there are a lot of potential irritants in there, so I don't let them linger)
5. Apply a thick layer of Aztec healing clay, activated charcoal, and diluted ACV  (my go-to mix), let sit until dry
6. Rinse clay mask off completely, pat dry, and apply manuka honey
7. After ten minutes, rinse honey off, splash on some unscented Thayers, and apply a more hydrating mask (currently trying to get through some sheet masks I was given)
8. After ten minutes, remove the final mask and apply my usual moisturizers (CeraVe mixed with a few drops of jojoba oil)

I find that this routine really helps my skin stay clear and hydrated, and by the time I remove the final mask, any redness from the clay mask has faded completely! I have combination skin (oily forehead/chin, dry nose, normal cheeks) and these products have been a huge help in clearing my adult acne.

[Skin Concerns] What can I do to reduce this scar on my knuckle?,"Didn’t get any answers last time I asked. 

https://imgur.com/a/23Ws6C6

When I was moving a few months ago, I sliced open my knuckle at the end of my pinky and it took a long time to heal. Because it was such an inconvenient spot for an injury, I kept reopening the scab when I would do basic things (reach inside my pocket, brush my hand against a wall/door). It was a pain in the ass and when it finally healed it has left a nasty dark scar. It seems more like a circulation thing as I can “rub away” the redness but the blood pools back into that knuckle. What can I do to reduce the prominence of this scar?


I also have a similar, smaller scar on my middle finger knuckle which, coincidentally, also came from when I was moving.

I don’t have great skin, but my face has been breaking out extra crazy this week because I just started a new BC. So today at work, I happened to be on the same floor as my work bestie and dropped by to check in. She immediately looks at me and goes ‘woah, are you ok? Your face is really breaking out. I’ve never seen it like that.’ and then proceeds to hand me a mirror. Great. Thanks. Super fucking helpful. I was really speechless because how do you even respond to that? What exactly do you want me to do about it at work? Like if I just washed my face, it would magically disappear? I know my face looks terrible and I’m sure this is a foreign concept to her since she has perfect skin, but some of us work our asses off to take care of our skin and it still looks horrible no matter what we do. 

Why can’t you just be a tactful person and not comment on it like most people. Why oh why do people feel the need to make comments? Do they really think we don’t know what we look like (apparently she thinks that hence the mirror) or that we aren’t doing anything about it? Well I do and I am. My skin just hates me.

[ACNE] Kiehl’s products and finding the right moisturizer,"I have very oily skin and I have been trying to repair my moisture barrier.
Almost every moisturizer I have used has made me break out.
I tried Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cream and surprisingly it didn’t make me break out. I used up the small jar over 2-3 weeks, but I didn’t see an improvement in my oily skin, so I decided to try Kiehl’s Oil-Free Gel Cream (for normal to oily skin) and it made me break out. In fact, a lot of gel moisturizer have made me break out.

I think I will go back to the first one just because it didn’t break me out. Does anyone have experience with these products and any idea why I got those results? I’ve listed the ingredients below.

[Routine Help] ISO Frag-free nighttime moisturizer w/o peptides or niacinamide,"1. Mostly normal skin 48-year-old skin with eczema around eyes (esp. in winter when my eyes tear),  teeny bit of hyperpigmentation on upper lip, and sensitive to fragrance

2. Skincare routine: 

**AM:**

	◦	CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser - Normal To Oily Skin

	◦	TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 in winter when skin is dry

	◦	Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado as needed

	◦	DE Protini 

	◦	Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF if I’m going to be in sun more than 15 min. (I live north)

**PM:**

	◦	Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm if I’ve worn foundation or sunscreen - will go back to Clinique TTDO when this is done, because even though I like the fragrance, it’s a little irritating around my eyes

	◦	CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser

	◦	if I use AHA/BHA or Vit C, CeraVe Moisturizing Cream - perfect for deepest, driest winter, but too heavy for the rest of the year

	◦	if no AHA/BHA or Vit C, DE Protini

**2-3 times/week, at night:**

	◦	COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner -- I figure I should exfoliate sometimes and this is the least irritating chemical exfoliant I’ve found. I'm thinking of switching to AHA only, since I don’t think I really need BHA (blemishes are rare, and always occasion for me to shout out loud, ""OMG, everyone! I've got a pimple!"").

**OR**

	◦	Timeless Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid  (aka hotdog water) -- only added this because the last time I got a facial, the aesthetician’s only suggestion was a Vit C serum (guess I'm hoping it will help keep hyperpigmentation at bay)

3.		Top 3 Products: 

a)  Kiehl's avocado eye cream was a game changer for the eczema around my eyes. It doesn’t migrate, it doesn’t have fragrance, and it soothes the red scaliness that rings my eyes every winter. Usually, when I get moisturizer near my eyes—even frag free—they tear up and it starts the cycle over again. The avocado eye cream does give me milia if I use it twice daily, so I try to use it only when my lids feel dry and sore. 

b) I’m one of those DE Protini junkies who keeps shelling out because it makes my skin plump and smooth.

c) Also a Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence fan. I don’t like the alcohol scent, but it dries to a matte finish, doesn’t pill under makeup, and I forget I’m wearing sunscreen. I do find it drying without a moisturizer underneath, though.

I’ve been a lurker for a while, but I’m posting now because I’m in search of a replacement fragrance-free nighttime moisturizer without peptides or niacinamide, to replace the CeraVe cream. The CeraVe is great in winter, but it’s just too heavy the rest of the year (as is Cetaphil cream). I was using the Protini every evening, but I just started using Deciem’s skincare routine app, and it shows a conflict between both the Vit C (presumably any LAA) and the AHA/BHA and the Protini. I use the app because I'm rubbish at science. The app seems to show a conflict between both actives and any peptides or niacinamide. I have used and liked Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, LRP Toleraiane Sensitive Fluide, and CeraVe PM, but all have niacinamide. Any suggestions for a nighttime moisturizer that’s lighter than CeraVe cream but free of peptides or niacinamide? I live in Canada, so no Vanicream.",1571437431.0,0.5,1

[Research] Does tretinoin increase future cancer risk?,"Hey all!

I've been doing reading on tretinoin - my derm wants me on it, but I have been wanting to research more myself first.

It seems the main thing people talk about is how it increases cell turnover and say that is a good thing - which it might be, for short term gains for your skin. But given my cursory understanding of biology, doesn't that mean you need to run through more skin cell divisions, and perhaps over time that would lead to more chances for cancer - since cancer happens when cells have split enough times that there's eventually a mistake in their reproductive cycle. Given this, isn't tretinoin just pushing you towards skin cancer in the far future much faster?

I can't find any studies pointing either way - some saying that it reduces short term cancer risk, and other people claiming it increases cancer risk in the future. I heard that there just haven't been enough people on it long enough to be able to say - but I was hoping someone on this sub would know more about this than I do.

[Review] Ivermectin (Rosiver),"This stuff is worth its (considerably expensive) weight in gold! Oh, man. Wish I'd found it YEARS earlier!

So, I've been using Rosiver (1 % Ivermectin) for about 2 weeks now for awful rosacea (redness on cheeks and nose and chin, big gross bumps, the works). Before this, I couldn't let ANYTHING touch my skin without an awful breakout of the bumps and redness. Couldn't wash with even the simplest of cleansers, couldn't moisturize with /anything/ at all (and my bank account was depleted from all the things I'd tried), and forget wearing make up to cover it up! My skin was a mess.

Fast forward two weeks using Rosiver and my skin isn't perfect but it's SO much better. And the best part? I've been able to use moisturizer (I use Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion + on my face, and Paula's Choice Youth-Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid around the eyes and temples) and make up (It cosmetics CC+ concealer) with NO skin explosions afterwards! :D :D :D I can't even begin to describe how happy this has made me. In the evening I just wash my face with lukewarm water, but in a couple of weeks I'm going to try some Paula's Choice cleanser instead, if everything keeps going smoothly.

I don't notice any negative effects from Rosiver, and there's not much of a smell to it, maybe just the faintest whiff but it's not unpleasant. It seems that my nose is taking longer to clear than my cheeks did. And of course, the price has to be mentioned. I'm in Canada and it was $200 for a 60g tube, but you use so little that I think it ought to last at least 3 or 4 months, if not longer.

[Routine Help] What are Lipo Hydroxy Acids (LHAs) and what can they do for your skin?,"In recent years, I've noticed that we've all become a lot savvier to different skincare ingredients. We are way more eager now to research what's in the products we put on our face (THANK GOD!). By now, you should know what exfoliation means, at least in broad terms. But, with so many new ingredients emerging, we're forced to step up our knowledge of skincare terminology almost every day.

The main ingredients I've noticed that people are eager to include in their regime are AHAs and BHAs. As you're probably aware, Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs) speed up cell turnover and gently exfoliate the skin without being abrasive or stripping, gently resurfacing and improving skin texture. AHAs (such as Glycolic Acid) are water-soluble, while BHAs (like Salicylic Acid) are oil-soluble, making them more effective at clearing out clogged pores.

Recently, a new acid family became increasingly popular, a family that is commonly referred to as LHAs - Lipo Hydroxy Acids (you may also see them listed on the label as capryloyl salicylic acid). The ingredient is increasingly found in creams, cleansers, toners and spot treatments thanks to its gentle exfoliating powers.

## SO WHAT ARE LHAS?

Lipohydroxy acid is a derivative of Salicylic Acid and has skin renewing, exfoliating, and acne-treating properties. Its gentleness comes from its slower cell penetration compared to Salicylic Acid, due to a higher molecular weight. LHAs are also more lipophilic than Salicylic Acid, this resulting in an individual cell-by-cell exfoliation that is associated with excellent tolerability. And while Salicylic Acid has a pH around 3, LHA’s has a PH around 5 which is much closer to the natural pH of the skin. This means it’s less harsh to the skin natural barrier and even suitable for sensitive skin. Lipo Hydroxy Acids are also a great alternative to BHAs for oily skin that is prone to sensitivity or dehydration.

As an anti-aging ingredient, the use of LHAs use has been proved to result in dermal thickening and has been found to be an excellent hyaluronic acid, collagen, and elastin booster.

It also has gentle astringent properties, making it great for those with acne-prone skin, clogged pores, or uneven skin texture. It penetrates the skin less than Salicylic Acid, with proprieties similar to those of Glycolic Acid.

## LHA PRODUCTS I LOVE

\*\*\*Disclaimer: The products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a product, and I thought I could share my experience.

I wanted to source the cleanest ingredient list as possible and to avoid products that contain drying alcohols, fragrance, and essential oils (you can't even imagine how hard it is to do this). It all came to a list of 3 products that I would personally recommend.\*\*\*

LHA was first developed by L’Oreal researchers in the 1980s, and as such, is found exclusively in L’Oreal or L’Oreal-owned skincare products.

1. **La Roche Posay - Effaclar Duo** \- Good Spot Treatment
2. **Skinceuticals - LHA Toner**
3. **Skinceuticals - LHA Cleanser**

These are the only products I found (if you can believe it) without/or with minimal nasty ingredients. I cannot understand why companies use SO MUCH ALCOHOL in products meant for Oily Skin. Overdrying is never a good choice, regardless of your skin type, so be aware. Being patented by L'Oreal, it's very hard for other companies to use LHAs. But these a good start for everyone who has Oily skin, prone to sensitivity or dehydration. Stay plump, my Oily skin warriors!",1571418001.0,0.83,2

[Product Question] Favorite Salicylic Acid toners and cleansers?,"So I've been using the Obagi clenziderm toner and cleanser which are 2% salicylic acid and they have done wonders for my skin! The only problems are that they smell QUITE strong (looked at the ingredients, they add menthol..) and they're pretty expensive. My skin seems to respond pretty well to salicylic acid so I'm looking for some recommendations on what to replace these with!

What has worked for you? And I'd prefer the products to be specifically salicylic acid rather than just a different exfoliant. Having more than once type of exfoliant is fine, as long as salicylic acid is still in there. 

Also routine atm:

AM: Vivant green tea cleanser, Klairs supple toner, Origins original skin moisturizer, Biore perfect face milk spf 50

[Sun Care] Bioderma Photoderm Max Spray SPF 50+ and Lait Famille SPF 50+ reformulated without white cast,"Bioderma has reformulated these two sunscreens without **Octocrylene, Avobenzone, and Tinosorb M** (responsible for the white cast) that are common in their other formulas. I had been hoping for exactly this but didn't know it been done until recently.

They have no white cast and they didn't feel heavy to me. They are NOT matte, but the finish ranges from very dewy at best to very shiny at worst, depending on circumstances (skin type, humidity level, how many products you're layering this on). I must say instances where I found it very shiny were very few, and most of the time I found it just very dewy, glass skin like.

Both contain **Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Tinosorb S, Octisalate, and Uvinul T 150**. They're alcohol-free and fragrance-free. The Lait has a slightly longer ingredients list than the Spray and contains vitamin E.

This [retailer page](https://www.easyparapharmacie.co.uk/bioderma-photoderm-max-spray-spf50-400ml.html) lists a PPD rating of 33 for the Spray but no rating is given for the Lait.

[Photoderm MAX Spray SPF 50+ 400ml](https://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/max-spray-spf-50)

**Cost:** I got the big 400ml spray bottle for 16,90€ at a French pharmacy. One spray fills about 90-95% of a 1/4 tsp so I usually just apply one spray of it over the face and neck. A 400ml bottle would give 320 doses of 1.25ml (or a 1/4 tsp). The period-after-opening symbol for the Photoderm sunscreens says 6 months, so a bottle would be enough sunscreen for twice daily applications for the face and neck for 5-6 months. That means spending just 33€ a year per person on sunscreen for just the face ! The official website only shows this new formula for the SPF 50 in the 400ml bottle, not the SPF 30 or SPF 50 in the 200ml bottle yet.

**Application:** I spray it in my hand and apply it. It goes on a bit oily on application but spreads easily and sets quickly without feeling heavy or sticky. Touching your face afterward, it'll feel moist and smooth but not greasy. You can still feel it on your face for about four hours, after which you'd want to renew the application for continued protection. I like to think that how much of it I can still feel on my skin gives me an indication of how it's breaking down over the course of time and whether I'm still being protected or not. I didn't experience pilling and didn't notice any smell. I'm careful with swiping this lightly on my under eye area with my fingertips, and don't have issues with stinging. I haven't sweated with these, so I don't know what happens if it runs down into your eyes.

**Finish:** The finish ranges from very dewy to very shiny. It is very shiny when I use it in the morning after my many steps routine that layers multiple hydrating and moisturizing products. If I reduce my routine a little or when I use it to reapply halfway throughout the day when my face is drier, it sets quickly to a very acceptable level of very dewy. I'm thinking most people with a basic routine might not find it too shiny, unless they have very oily skin maybe or are in a humid climate. The shine is pretty much on par with the Klairs Airy UV Essence. I find the spray bottle and the thin texture makes it very easy to reapply during the day (I kinda had been slacking on that with other sunscreens). It's not something you can carry around, though, but you could buy a smaller spray bottle or an airless pump to put it in your purse.

**Notes:** I had been breaking out prior to this when trying out the Purito Unscented sunscreens, and since switching to using only this Spray since a week ago my skin has cleared up and evened out and the highly dewy finish this gives me makes my skin look just glowy and healthy. It's not quite a saran wrap look, but actually gives a glass skin finish. I look better moisturized and a lot less flaky with this too (from Tretinoin and Granactive Retinoid use). Also after a week I noticed that my face finally matches the lighter skin tone on my neck and the rest of my body. My face was weirdly browner before, with a demarcation line like The Mask. I had been using AB sunscreens mostly.

[Photoderm MAX Family Milk SPF 50+ 250ml](https://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/max-family-milk-spf-50)

**Cost:** The new Lait formula exists only for now in this huge 250ml tube with the blue ""Famille"" label. I ordered it from a French pharmacy website for 12,99€. The 100ml tubes without the blue circle are still the old formula.

**Finish:** It is very similar in finish to the Spray. It is thicker and goes on more like a milk at first, but after you rub it in feels the same as the Spray. I used it to reapply midday yesterday, a whole 1/4 tsp of it, and then some, all over my face and neck. It was very shiny but when I checked in the mirror an hour later the finish had set to a very acceptable level of dewy. I've only had it a day so I haven't used it a lot yet.

The expiry date for the Spray is February 2022 and December 2021 for the Lait, so I'm assuming they're less than a year-old. When I checked other pharmacy websites and eBay resellers, some still listed the old formulas with Octocrylene, Avobenzone and Tinosorb M, so you have to check the ingredients list to make sure what you're getting. This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/devpq2/sun_care_psa_bioderma_photoderm_max_spray_formula/) compares the old and new formula for the spray.

Some info about me: I have medium tan South East Asian skin tone, NC 35. I used to have oily skin but don't anymore since getting into skincare and using a very hydrating routine.

My holy grail sunscreen ideally contains at least Tinosorbs, Uvinuls, and no Octinoxate, Octocrylene, Oxybenzone, alcohol or fragrance, is light and matte and cosmetically elegant. This ticks all the boxes, except for the matteness, but at least it is not horribly shiny, and is more like dewy *most* times. And if you don't mind it, you can always powder on top or use a blotting paper.

Chances are I might not like this during the summer months when it's 38°C and minimum 60% humidity every day, but after a more than a year-long search of the perfect sunscreen (I must have tried like 30 at least, maybe more) I'm ready to settle on these for the rest of the year. I hadn't found anything from the French pharmacy that had the best formula *and* finish, but this new Bioderma Spray version is the best compromise for high reliable European protection, clean formula and daily wear, along with being excellent value (and likely reducing waste) !

This makes a great sunscreen for daily use while keeping higher PPD but alcohol-containing sunscreens like La Roche Posay Shaka Fluid for beach/sport days and hikes. Plus the big bottle vs little bottle thing.

I hope they reformulate their other sunscreens similarly, like the Aquafluid, most particularly the tinted versions. I like to use the Golden one for when I like a little coverage on the days when I may need it.",1571417003.0,0.88,16
[Routine Help] Onexton seemed to stop working. What else can I try?,"I am pretty sure that my Onexton (Clindamycin Phosphate + Benzoyl Peroxide) cream has stopped working, as it seems to be doing nothing at preventing new pimples. I seem to get 2-4 every month, and when they finally heal, new ones pop up. I’ve had 3 on my forehead since last Thursday, and one just popped up on a cheek that was finally looking clear. I’ve been using it since October of last year, even though it says to use it within 12 weeks or by the expiration date. Costs 20 dollars each and didn’t feel like wasting it, so.. What are my alternatives? Do I try another topical antibiotic with Benzoyl Peroxide? I thought the Benzoyl Peroxide was supposed to prevent the bacteria from becoming resistant to the Clindamycin Phosphate. 

I have also been using Tretinoin 0.8/0.1% gel since October as well, which has helped a ton, but the increase I think has made my forehead in particular really dry even with moisturizer. Used CeraVe Cream in the same time frame which seemed to help but has been tingling recently due to my irritated forehead, so I switched to Vanicream’s Gentle Moisturizing Cream, been using that for a week and we will see how it goes. I wish I just had clear skin and could stop giving a shit if only my pimples didn’t take forever to clear and some of them didn’t look so inflamed.",1571416861.0,1.0,1
[Skin Concerns] What can I do about this scar on my knuckle?,"https://imgur.com/a/23Ws6C6

When I was moving a few months ago, I sliced open my knuckle at the end of my pinky and it took a long time to heal. Because it was such an inconvenient spot for an injury, I kept reopening the scab when I would do basic things (reach inside my pocket, brush my hand against a wall/door). It was a pain in the ass and when it finally healed it has left a nasty dark scar. It seems more like a circulation thing as I can “rub away” the redness but the blood pools back into that knuckle. What can I do to reduce the prominence of this scar?


I also have a similar, smaller scar on my middle finger knuckle which, coincidentally, also came from when I was moving.

[Anti-Aging]34M Need help building a routine,"This me: [https://i.imgur.com/oKQc0jU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oKQc0jU.jpg)

Every time I come to this sub, I have grand intentions of starting a routine. I take my cup of coffee and read through the wiki and start tabbing out products to research. Eventually, I hit critical mass, get overwhelmed and find something else to do. Thought I would turn over a new leaf with a post and own my country-boy ignorance :)

I have sensitive dry skin that occasionally gets red, splotchy and flaky. Not loving this and it would be pretty cool if I could make that not happen anymore.

Grew up with bad acne but that has subsided with age. I would like to reduce this further and possibly reduce scars (not shown well in my photo).

Overall, I want to get a head start on aging rather than starting the fight after I see more blatant signs. I think my skin... tone(?) could be improved as well. Eye cream? Firming serum? BHA? 

As an example, for finding a moisturizer, occlusives, humectants, and emollients all look valuable so how do you pick? 

Right now, I use  Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid during my nightly shower. I then use coconut oil as my ""moisturizer"" in the AM and PM. Yeah, that's it.I know I need SPF but don't know if there is a certain brand that I should use.

I’ve been a bit ill and on bed rest of late so skincare hasn’t been a priority. I’m just starting to feel better and I’m dreaming of an at home spa style treatment to get my skin beautiful again - it needs some serious tlc as I haven’t had the strength even to moisturise or exfoliate for weeks. 

I still won’t be able to scrub with a loofah or body brush, but I was wondering what chemical body peel treatments there are for at home use? I don’t even know if that’s quite what I’m looking for.

[Personal] Patch test products people!,"All right. I have been using cerave moisturizer for YEARS. It was for sensitive skin, non comedogenic. I went on a backpacking trip for a month and became duly frustrated with my skin routines, and aside from moisturizer and sunscreen (and washing my face at night) I gave up on every thing.

My skin freaked. I was getting large cystic eruptions all over my cheeks, painful with no end in sight. At this point I was so emotionally done with dealing with acne. I got back from my trip and all I was doing was putting sunscreen on and washing it off at the end of the day. That's it.

Well it's been about 3 weeks of that...and my skin is almost clear. I have some PIH that's still fading but no new break outs.

[Acne] Purging with chemical exfoliants,"I’ve struggled with my acne for about ten years now. It used to be on my forehead at first, years later cleared up and travelled down to my cheeks. The past couple of months my cheeks have gotten a bit better, however they weren’t as clear as I’d like them to be. After seeing a lot of people talking about it online I finally decided to buy Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA liquid exfoliant.

[Personal] Bless this sub,"27F, Combination skin, acne prone. 

I’ve never had a proper skincare routine. When I was in high school I tried a bunch of cheap drugstore products. My family doesn’t really get acne so no one knew what to get me to help. I found myself using a cotton wipe and putting rubbing alcohol on my face to dry out my oil and pimples. (Don’t ever do that.)

Mid-20s, I used whatever free cleanser came with my holiday makeup sets at Lancôme or Estēe Lauder. Whatever was available for cash wash. (No one in my house used face wash besides me.)

Late 20s. I found this sub! Figured out my skin type. Found found from you guys about incidecoder.com where I researched all of the skincare products I thought about buying. Since I have sensitive acne prone skin this is hugeeeee. Then I saw all of your good reviews about The Ordinary and a few about Differin. I have the Niacinamide + Zinc form TO and the Daily Deep cleanser from Differin. Still purging my skin, but it’s improved so much in such a short period of time. Waiting for my other TO products to come in the mail next week to help with my acne scars. 

Thank you guys so much for all of your insight. It has helped me learn how to take care of myself when I didn’t have anyone to turn to.",1571404009.0,0.89,3

[Routine Help] Retinol Vs. Bakuchiol + Product Recommendations,"# What is Bakuchiol?

Having a long history in Ancient Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, Bakuchiol has been part of the skincare world for ages. You can find the skin-loving ingredient in the plant Psoralea corylifolia. Its Bachi seeds are packed with antioxidants and are known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Bakuchiol acts as a phytochemical that has demonstrated antiageing effects when applied topically, working similarly as Retinol, without the side effects. 

# What's the difference between Bakuchiol and Retinol?

Bakuchiol and Retinol show similar gene expression in the skin, so they both up-regulate the production of collagen and elastin. They both help with reducing fine lines and wrinkles, fading scars and hyperpigmentation, and boosting cell renewal. Probably the most notable difference between the two is that while Retinol can be irritating and cause redness, dryness, peeling, and sun sensitivity, Bakuchiol is not. Bakuchiol is promising as a more sustainable alternative to Retinol and is generally tolerated better. Moreover, Bakuchiol does not cause photosensitivity, so it's safe to use even during the day. Modern science is backing the ingredient, too. [A study by the British Journal of Dermatology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947134) demonstrates that Bakuchiol is comparable with Retinol in its ability to improve photoaging. Moreover, Bakuchiol and Retinol both significantly decreased wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, with no statistical difference between the two. The only difference is that Retinol users did report more facial skin irritation and stinging.

# Who will benefit the most from Bakuchiol?

Almost all skin types can benefit from the use of Bakuchiol. The ingredient is ideal for anyone who cannot tolerate Retinol, such as those with sensitive skin or rosacea, or anyone who is looking for a non-irritating, natural ingredient with anti-aging benefits. The antioxidant-rich ingredient is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, making it great for those with oily, acne-prone skin, and congested pores.

# Bakuchiol products that I personally love

\*\*\*Disclaimer: The products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a product, and I thought I could share my experience. 

I wanted to source the cleanest ingredient list as possible and to avoid products that contain drying alcohols, fragrance, and essential oils (you can't even imagine how hard it is to do this). It all came to a list of 3 products that I would personally recommend.\*\*\*

1. **Best overall (in my opinion):** *Bybi Beauty 1% Bakuchiol Booster*. First of all, this is 12 British Pounds (\~15-16$ so great price point) and contains only two ingredients: 1% Bakuchiol and 99% Squalane. I assume nobody will have a problem using this, not even the most sensitive skin unless you have a particular allergy to one of these two ingredients. 
2. **Awesome ingredient formula:** *AO Skincare RAW NURTURE PM TREATMENT.* This nighttime treatment is an antioxidant and nutrient-rich that hydrates and stimulates collagen production. It's formulated with peptides, fatty acids, and cell-renewal ingredients. The dynamic active is Bakuchiol, and also contains humectants such as Red Algae, Lactic Acid, and Honey to attract moisture and hydrate the skin. The Harakeke Seed Oil and Totarol are powerful antioxidants that literally ""feed"" your face and protect against environmental damage. The Kiwi Seed Oil improves elasticity and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The treatment also contains Vitamin C and Bearberry Leaf Extract to brighten your complexion and reduce photodamage. The Olive Leaf Extract is an oxygenating agent and is good enough to penetrate even thicker layers of skin to provide long-lasting moisture.
3. **Clean Ingredient List:** *Herbivore Bakuchiol Retinol Alternative Smoothing Serum.* I really like that this contains PHAs which I personally love, and provide a very gentle exfoliation while hydrating. It has Tremella mushroom to boost the skin-refining effects of Bakuchiol and works very well for hydration. 

I know there are some popular Bakuchiol serums such as Glow Cycle™ Retin-ALT Power Serum by Ole Henriksen but I will never go near the thing because FRAGRANCE is listed in the upper part of the ingredient list. Plus it contains other ingredients that I personally find sensitizing. 

The other popular one is the SQUALANE + PHYTO-RETINOL SERUM by Biossance. This one contains Essential Oils, and not just any essential oil but Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Peel Oil. This oil is way too strong to ever touch your face (it's used to treat cellulite so you can imagine how disruptive it is for the skin natural barrier of your face). Many people reported irritation after using this including swollen eyes or strong reactions. 

This small ""article"" was to encourage people to try natural alternatives to Retinol without fear. I know how confusing it is to find good products in today's oversaturated market, but if you have any other questions, I'm here to help.",1571399547.0,0.63,7

"[Skin Concerns] Im going camping and am worried about my skin, need tips :)","Sorry in advance for the waffle haha

I’m going to the jungle to camp and hike around with school we had two options an easier one where we only camped for 1 night and got provided food and water and went on trails or the one I'm doing where you don’t have any of that and camp for the full 5 nights we have to bring all our food and water with us, we don’t even have access to toilets which is one thing I'm really not looking forward to (also its part of my countries equivalent of duke of ed it looks great on a CV ;))

My skin has only recently cleared up after years of problems as I've found something that actually works for my skin which is fantastic. But I'm worried that this camp might trigger old problems and take a while to go away. My friend who has skin that can withstand anything without getting a single spot says I should use antibacterial wipes on my face which doesn’t sound like such a good idea for me as my skin is quite sensitive and very prone to breakouts and this might give me a rash - which I don't really want to risk haha.

I won’t have much access to clean water so I'm not sure how well i’ll be able to wash my face. Im going to try and bring my spin brush (if I'm allowed) to hopefully do something and a moisturiser. I have school formal a week after this and don’t want to have bad skin for it. I don’t have much space to pack my whole routine and I'm worried that missing a couple steps might make my skin upset.

Any tips would be appreciated, thanks!",1571392512.0,1.0,6

[Acne] Cystic Acne Product Recommendations,"Product recommendations for Cystic acne

Hi! 

I get pretty bad cystic acne and have for about the past 7/8 years. I think it is probably hormonal and have tried most medications (apart from accutane) and many many products.

Does anyone have any recommendations that have really helped them? The only think I have ever found really help is the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask. Recently used the Cosrx Low PH cleanser and it has broken me out pretty badly in milia/whiteheads as well as made cystic acne flair up. Stopped using it and hoping it will now subside but could do with some recommendations.

[Skin Concern] Help with dehydrated skin,"So my skin is dehydrated, oily, acne prone.
I been on differin for the past three months, but have seen no progress at all so will be stopping use. I concluded that my acne must be from my dehydrated skin. Skin is oily all the time, but when I cleanse, skin gets extremely dry ( no matter how gentle the cleanser is)

AM:
Cleanse with water and then moisturize 
PM:
Cleanse with Vanicream gentle cleanser and then apply HA acid, then moisturize

[PSA] Minocycline is the devil,"By some miracle I didn’t have to wait 3 months to get in to see a dermatologist. I called and they had a cancellation! Amazing, right?

So I go to my appointment, she prescribed azelaic acid, tretinoin, and minocycline. I had never been on minocycline, only doxycycline. The derm said to watch out for headaches and dizziness. I said okay and left. 

The headaches were more like migraines with aura for me which was NOT good. I couldn’t focus my eyes, I lost my balance, there was so much pressure on the back of my neck at the base of my skull. I went online and found the list of side effects as well as did some research on Reddit about other users’ experiences. I realized this antibiotic was not for me after 6 days. 

On the 5th day I started getting a little sick. I had a cough and some body aches. Found out that’s a side effect. Day 6 was the last day I took it. I couldn’t focus while driving and I couldn’t look down without pain. Said fuck this I’m not taking it. 

Day 7 was last night. I didn’t take it. I felt some itchiness around my mouth but figured it wasn’t a big deal since I have sensitive skin and was probably breaking out. Before bed I could feel a pimple coming so my anxiety kicked in and I tried to pick at it. It started throbbing like crazy. I put some honey on it and covered it with a bandaid.

My lip was FUCKED this morning when I woke up. Turns out, this little pimple was a massive cold sore outbreak. Mind you, I haven’t had a cold sore in 10 years. The last time I had one it was tiny and in the middle of my lip. I had mono at the time. Never had another one. 

I started freaking out. This antibiotic weakened my immune system enough to make me break out in cold sores. I had to call the derm and tell her what happened and had to pick up these horse pill antivirals and some doxycycline. I am so upset. 

I’m not mad at her, I’m mad at my body. I’m mad that an antibiotic that comes with serious (however supposedly uncommon) is even ALLOWED TO BE PRESCRIBED. All because I wanted my skin to be clear. Well joke’s on me. No more cystic acne, but instead a giant explosion of pain and weeping that will probably scar because my skin is garbage and scars so easily. 

Anyway! My point is, if you have a sensitive system, don’t take minocycline. If you have any underlying illnesses, conditions, autoimmune whatever anything, don’t take this. I have some autoimmune liver thing I now need to check on too. If you need any more info message me! 

TLDR: Minocycline weakens your immune system which caused a cold sore outbreak for me (after 10 years without one). Stay away!",1571372807.0,0.4,8

Male, 20

I've never had a skincare routine. Thank god I have been blessed with good skin genetics but lately I've been having some problems and even without those problems I think it is time to take my grooming more seriously.

My main problem issue right now is dry skin. I do have a small amount of pimples but it's few and they clear themselves relatively quickly.

So, today I went with a dermatologist trying to get into a new routine mainly because I was intimidated at how many steps and products were talked about here in this subreddit. At the end of the appointment I was a bit disappointed. First of all I mentioned how i had dry skin all over my body but it stopped (Except for my face) when I started drinking more water and he basically laughed at me for being naive saying that most probably didn't have any relation. Then he proceeded to watch my face and prescribe the same [face soap](https://www.medicamentosplm.com/Home/productos/alergibon_jab%C3%B3n_hipoalerg%C3%A9nico/60/101/6199/475) and the same [antibiotic](https://www.dokteronline.com/es/dalacin-t) that he gave me back when I was about 15 and my main problem was huge pimples. That seemed weird to me as I wasn't there for the pimples and I told him that I basically stopped washing my face precisely because it just left my skin way too dry to the point of cracking (If i touch my face dry skin falls off), again he just dismissed me and said it was normal. Because i have very few pimples i prefer living with those than a completely dry face. I asked him if he was going to give me something to put on after my face wash but he just said no and told me that having dry skin after washing is normal. I kept asking about the dryness and he basically just said ""yeah don't worry wash your face with the soap and use this antibiotic gel"" (As I mentioned, i have experience with those and while they help with pimples, they just leave me dry as cardboard)

I also mentioned how i had a lot of dry flakes in my hair some months ago. I went on to [r/HaircareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/) trying to get advice on a hairstyle and some people helped me with my scalp issues. They taught me about not washing everyday, using shampoos without sulfate and using a tea tree conditioner (I never used any conditioner). It did not solve it 100% through but it did improve the situation A LOT. I used to leave black shirts really gross full of flakes and now I don't see any unless I actively look for flakes in a magnified mirror. If my problem was a 10, i managed to dial it back to a 3. Well, my dermatologist basically told me that was really stupid and that I should be washing my hair everyday. He recommended a [shampoo](https://www.medihealth.net/producto-pirimed?url=pirimed) which does seem like it is made for seborrheic dermatitis (That I do believe I could have) , the problem is that it has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I told him about how Head and Shoulders destroyed my hair and he just said yeah that's too bad but try this one. I was about to buy it but I don't have much money right now and in the short span that i have followed [r/haircarescience](https://www.reddit.com/r/haircarescience/) advice i I did notice some improvements.

I don't want to judge based on appearances but I did notice that the dermatologist is quite old and he attends mainly older people (Late 60s and up) and his office is in his house. He does have his degree. I really don't like judging based on this but i did notice it.

I know i am basically asking a bunch of unknown people from god knows where to judge a fully trained medical doctor but I really left with the feeling of dissapointment. I don't follow advice blindly, even if people in this subreddit and [r/haircarescience](https://www.reddit.com/r/haircarescience/) are not doctors I always get full explanations as to why I should do what they recommend and how things work, my doctor basically just said ""trust me on this one, no explanation""

I have mild- moderate acne on my chin and have for several years. I’m an adult now and I got sick of it never going away so I finally went to a dermatologist. It went about how people describe their experience on this sub. She came in for about two minutes, asked me like two questions, talked in super speed, basically ran out of the room, and charged me 60 bucks lol. 

She prescribed me 100 mg doxycycline 2x a day and sulfacetamide sodium. I’m supposed to do this for 3 months and then go back to her.

1. She told me to not moisturize. She said she specifically tells all her patients with acne to not moisturize. Why the heck not? 

2. What is your favorite benzoyl peroxide cleanser? I currently use a random Origins cleanser but she recommended something with benzoyl peroxide.

[Skin Concerns] Could anyone please help me find a moisturizer/skincare routine to make my face less red?,"Hi there!  I'm a female, early to mid 20s, and I'm having trouble finding a skincare routine that doesn't make my face all red.  It generally is kinda red most of the time (if anyone has any advice to make it less red, please let me know!) but after applying moisturizers it gets even more red!  I've also noticed it's at its most even and calmest right after I wash my face (doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold) and before I moisturize it.  It also looks extremely calm and smooth after I use a yogurt mask (just plain yogurt on my face for 15 minutes) and before I moisturize.


Here's a link to my face: [https://imgur.com/a/zWJl2Fl] (https://imgur.com/a/zWJl2Fl)

And here's the products I've been using in my routine:

SheaMoisture African Black Soap

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Exfoliating Cleanser (once a week)
Yogurt as a mask (once a week)

The Body Shop Vitamin E Moisture Cream

Olay Daily Moisturizer SPF 15


I generally use a moisturizer as well as a moisturizing sunscreen because otherwise my face is really dry and the sunscreen dries it out even more.


Here are the other products I've tried as replacements/supplements to my routine:


Walgreens Hydrating Water Gel (store brand version of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Water Gel) and straight Vitamin E oil mixed together--this is the one I use most often but have recently replaced with the Body Shop moisturizer because I ran out

Thayer's Rose Water Witch Hazel--makes my face very red and sometimes bumpy/irritated

Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer

CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 30 (used with another moisturizer)

Straight vitamin E oil on my face--it makes me break out!  It occasionally doesn't make my face as red, but not by much.  I will often mix it into any of my sunscreens or moisturizers.


All of these have made my face very red, even redder than usual!  I'm not sure why.  I eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and have had this redness whether or not I'm stressed.  I notice it the most whenever I'm out of the house and at work or school, but it's present at home, too.  I have no known allergies except a mild oral reaction to bananas, which I generally avoid.  


And the thing is my face has always been a bit too red.  I used to put foundation all over it to recolor it.  The moisturizers just make it worse.  But I really really wish I could go out in public without having to use foundation!  The pimple scars don't bother me so much, it's just the redness!


Would anyone recommend me a new moisturizer/toner/sunscreen/routine to try to help lessen and not increase the redness on my face?  Also, if anyone has any tips on making it a little smoother and evening the skin tone, to make it not as blotchy, those would be greatly appreciated!  I truly like the way my face looks after I wash it and before I use moisturizer; I just wish it could look like that all the time!

[ACNE] Skin is in dire need of help - worst it's ever been,"Hey guys, I need advice on my skincare routine because my **skin is the worst it's ever been**. The main reason I'm asking for help is that I've noticed a **dramatic decrease in my self-confidence** ever since my skin's been acting up.

I've never been really prone to acne but in the last couple of months, especially after the summer ended, my skin has just gotten worse. I'm not too comfortable with showing photos so I'll describe to the best of my ability. I have always had relatively large pores (apparently this is genetic) but they've become increasingly more clogged in the past few months. I currently have acne scars and some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. I also have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads on my nose. My skin is naturally oily but is also pretty dry around the nose at the moment.

I need all the suggestions I can get to make my skin at least a little better. I used to have an elaborate skincare routine that worked (my skin was relatively clear) but it suddenly started causing breakouts, so I abandoned that routine.

**My routine as of now:**

AM: Wash face with water

PM: Burt's Bees Natural Cleanser (w/ cotton extract), Garnier Micellar Water for sensitive skin and Vaseline to moisturize before sleeping

**My previous skincare routine:**

PM: Cetaphil gentle cleanser, micellar water, Cetaphil moisturizer

Any tips on moisturizer would be great as well. I hate how my skin feels sticky in the morning and throughout the next day but I haven't been successful in finding a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts.

I've also tried a multitude of products between these two routines such as Neem Face Wash, L'oreal Clay Masks, Garnier Face masks, Aloe Vera Moisturizer (this also worked really well for a while but now I break out whenever I apply), Biore nose strips etc etc

The one on my chin was a bit underground (I know, I should've left it alone) and the one above my lip wasn't messy at all....I don't think any pimple juice even came out, more like a plug, but there was a definite bump. I washed and put a hydrocolloid on each. They were only on for a few hours until I took a shower. 

I don't know if this is relevant, but when I took the bandages off they were pretty ""messy"" with gunk....like, not just a gunk dot the size of each bump I'd squeezed, but with individual gunk dots all over each bandage. By the next day there were a few more ""underground"" bumps on my chin and above my lip all around the areas of the original bump, and both areas were slightly swollen. I slightly squeezed a couple and they started weeping clear/light yellowish fluid. That's continued for a couple of days and gotten worse.

I've tried putting on neosporin and a band aid, mupirocen that I have left over from a staph infection last year, and a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (Pimecrolimus) that my derm said may help with non-infected weeping. I keep it clean and do my best not to pick, but both areas are still very inflamed days later. One side of each area seems to be the most inflamed/weepy -- not the site of the original bump.

[skin concern] I think my skin is trolling me at this point.,"okay so I'll try to keep it short. I'm acne prone but for the past few months I've had super clear skin until I traveled to Spain and back home. got two new face demons but that's not my issue, the issue is that whenever I get some kind of pimple, acne, cyst or whatsoever I leave it alone unless it has come to a head and then I'll try to pop it the right way. point is, whether I pop it or just leave it alone, the moment it heals it leaves a bump after a few weeks and I can still feel the content inside. it doesn't matter if I popped it or not it just heals like that. like the content in it is the same as whiteheads.

[Routine Help] Advice on how to level up a simple routine? Not really sure where to start,"Hi all! Ive been pretty into skincare for a while but am still feeling overwhelmed by all the information on this lovely sub. I’ve been doing a simple routine with the same rotation of 3 products but I really want to branch out and see if there are any recommendations of products to help me achieve more of my skin goals.

I’m an 18 year old female with combo skin ( Fairly oily with several dry patches around forehead and nose) and some acne scarring on my cheeks. My main goals are hydration, exfoliation and evening my skin tone.
Sorry if that was super long!

The routine:
A.M: 
•Rinse face with water
•Pat on Mamonde Rose Water Toner
•Apply Cosrx Snail Mucin 96

P.M:
•Apply coconut oil to dissolve makeup
•Use Neogen Green Tea Fresh Foaming Cleanser
•Pat on Mamonde Rose Water Toner
•Apply Cosrx Snail Mucin 96
(Once a week I exfoliate with a sugar scrub)

I really love and see improvements with the snail mucin but while the toner and cleanser feel good I don’t know if they’ve really caused too much in the way of improvements.

Right now, it has a lot of PIE, splotchyness and like a few whiteheads. I struggle with hormonal acne and unfortunately due to medications I am on and some medical conditions, I can't really take much to deal with it. 
It is fall now, and my skin looks congested, splotchy and red with PIE or maybe PIH.. not sure. MY current routine has worked for me last winter and fall... Especially my nighttime one. My skin usually looks hydrated and even when I wake up.. I will occasionally get a zit.. but my skin will still look fine. During the day... is when my skin FREAKS. As of right now, my skin feels tight under my makeup. 

Only new products I use is the sunscreen, Purito Centella Ampoule, Astral Cream Holy Snails Eldorado and IUNIK Tea tree ampoule. I patch tested them all. The Purito occassionally makes my skin sting. 

Here is a photo https://imgur.com/a/5DXA77K,

Currently my routine is : 

AM: 

1) Rinse with water. 

2) Occassionally I will use BR p50 (the sensitive skin formula) But I can't use it often else my skin freaks 

3) One layer of Kikumasamune 

4) One to two layers of Klairs Supple Prep Unscented 

5) CosRx Snail Essence 

6) One drop of IUnik Tea Tree mixed with a drop of Purito Centella ampoule. 

7) IUnik Propolis serum or Benton Snail Bee Ultimate Serum 

8) If I am feeling up for it I will add HolySnails Shark Sauce 

9) Two drops of my own mixture of oil (Tamanu, Pomogranate, Cammelia) mixed with a drop of Stratia Fortify and a drop of Holy Snails El Dorado - Occasionally I will massage with a guashua

10) Mizon Snail AIO black 

11) Stratia Liquid Gold 

12) A personal mixed concoction of Cerave Baby cream and La Roche Posay Cicaplast or Cicaplast Accelerateur (Occlusive) 

13) If I am wearing makeup (Which I usually am) Astral Cream. (Use to use Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, heard this was a dupe, it is not..) 

14) Current Sunscreen - Purito Centella Unscented Sunscreen. I also sometimes use Missha Flash Sunscreen. 

15) Primer

Over the summer I was diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis, so I had to change my whole routine to be fungal safe. I've always been oily, but recently it's been INSANE. Like, makeup gone off my forehead and nose within an hour or two of applying. (Same foundation and powder I've been using for years)

My skin is not dehydrated as far as I can tell. No redness, flaking, tightness etc. 

my current routine is

AM: 
-Rinse with warm water (mostly to remove vaseline from PM) 
-Garnier Oily skin micellar water (in green bottle)

I know I need to add a sunscreen, but I'm working on finding a fungal safe one that will work for  my skin

PM: 
-Vanicream Gentle cleanser (w/ Clarisonic 3x/week)
-Stridex (red box) 
-Sebamed Clear Face Gel
-Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment around eyes/healing pimples etc


I'm just kind of at a loss as to what I should change/add to deal with this oil. I'm currently going through at least 5 blotting sheets per work day. I've pretty much given up on base makeup, so I just blot and powder every hour or so and end up looking super flat/cakey. 

I recently tried The Ordinary Niacinimide, and I didn't notice any difference. I think it also made me break out a bit.

[Personal] my love hate-relation with dermatologist (mostly hate),"  

**Feeling lost**

so after switching dermatologist for the third time I finally found one that listened to me (or tried) and didn’t put me on Accutane, she sent me Adapalene 0.3 and spiro 100 mg but sha gave me some weird ass advices.

**Skin background**: my hormonal acne problem started since I was 17(25 now) after trying everything people told me dove soap, sulfur soap, lemon, toothpaste ... (yes, I’m sorry for my skin) I decided that was time to see the derm. what I remember from this *first appointment* is that he immediately send me Accutane for a year, sunscreen everyday (local brand) and washing face day and night with Neutrogena salicylic acid cleanser and YES no moisturizer , as expected my skin cleared up but after a few months after I finished the treatment my hormonal acne came back EVEN WORSE. After that I *switched dermatologist for the second time* and yes again Accutane this time 4 months, stopping 1 month and continuing with other 6 months she told me to keep using the same sunscreen and Neutrogena cleanser (no moisturizer) long story short my acne came back like 10 times worse, my combined skin became dry and dehydrated and super sensitive (first perioral dermatitis rushes I’ve ever had).

after that I kind of lost faith and started my skincare journey by myself I found out about **Reddit** and I can’t say how much this community changed things for good, I started to remove make up properly, to use moisturizer and just washing my face at nights my hormonal acne was still there but at least my face was hydrated and looking healthy, after a lot of trial and error I found the triggers of my perioral dermatitis(tea tree oil and sodium lauryl sulfate) and found my worst enemy ***BUTYLENE GLYCOl*** , after almost going crazy wondering why if I was using gentle products why my skin was so itchy and I was getting so much closed comedones I switched products like crazy spent so much money until (thanks do incidecoder.cosdna,skincarisma) I made the connection to butylene glycol. Now I’ve been 3 months BG free (this was so difficult it’s almost in every product) and no more closed comedones and itchiness.

Some model friend recommended a good dermatologist who helped with her hormonal acne. **third dermatologist,** she actually listened to me didn’t put me on Accutane, she actually believed my allergy to BG, send me adapalene .3 and spiro and sent me a list of recommended products for a new routine, on the other hand she told me not to use moisturizer (I don’t know why they want to dry the hell out of my skin when it’s not even oily) I told her that I wanted to use moisturizer so she send 2 recommendations one with butylene glycol (so she didn’t take the time to check the ingredient list of her recommendations) and the other contains lactic acid (I’m pretty sure that if I’m on adapalene using other acids will irritate my skin) she told me to use moisturizer just the nights that I’m **not** using adapalene (3xweek), told me to change my beloved Vanicream gentle cleanser for an expensive avene cleanser that contains fragance ... and to use it twice a day (again ), she recommended Eucerin sun face oil control dry touch spf 50 (contains alcohol denat). I could email her telling all of this and asking for more recommendation but I lost faith again 

**ROUTINE (third week on adapelene .3) everything its butylene glycol free**

Jojoba oil. I've finally found an occlusive that doesn't break me out. Now what do I do for hydration? [Acne],"It's been a long old journey to get to this point, but I think I've finally found an occlusive that doesn't give me acne. However, as you'll all know, jojoba oil isn't moisturising, and as someone who is dehydrated with a destroyed moisture barrier, I can't just rely on jojoba.

In the past year I've tried these products, all of which broke me out:

* Sebamed clear face care gel
* Neutrogena hydroboost gel
* Muji sensitive toning water
* Superdrug simply pure hydrating serum
* Cosrx snail 92 all in one cream
* The Ordinary moisturising factors
* Squalene oil
* Argan oil
* I'm probably missing a few, but those are the ones I can recall from the top of my head.

Is there an extremely basic way of delivering moisture to my skin, or does it have to be from a product with multiple ingredients? I can't really afford to experiment with super expensive serums. Now I have an occlusive in jojoba, Is there a basic DIY way I can go about getting the moisture?

Many thanks

[Skin Concerns] Getting rid of ingrown hairs not caused by hair removal.,"I've had terrible acne on the backs of my thighs for a few years now, but only now that I've got a skin routine down have I decided to actually care about it.

Well, I examined it in the shower.

It's not acne.

It's dozens of ingrown hairs.

WTF?

I haven't shaved my legs for months because it's spring down here in Aussieland, so it's not caused by shaving or any other kind of hair removal. Pretty sure the only other culprit is that I'm sitting on my ass all day every day (distance student), so while I take more frequent breaks than most (yay ADHD), it's not like I can stop that.

How do I fix ingrown hairs that aren't caused by hair removal?

"[Skin Concerns] I went a bit crazy on new products and my skin freaked out. Now anything I put on, it stings. How do I recover?","I guess I'll start with a bit of the story on what lead up to this? 

 I used to be quite into my skincare but I fell off the wagon a bit while living with my (now ex) boyfriend.  I recently met a guy I really like and he was one of the few people to guess my age correctly like, ever.  In the UK there is this law that you can be asked for ID for energy drinks and the age limit is 16-  I have been refused sales of red bull before when I forgot my ID, because I'm small and blonde and look young in general. So when this guy correctly said I'm 23/24 it was a massive kick up my butt to get my shit together again.   I have to admit, my skin has been quite bad lately, with a bunch of hormonal acne spots on my chin and some around my forehead.  My forehead has become oily while my cheeks look bumpy and textured/congested . I've been previously diagnosed with KP as a child and still get it a little bit around my face.  Horrible combination of oily and dry at the same time in different areas. I'm not sure what has caused these to come up all of a sudden but I imagine it's that I haven't been using any products with anything active in them lately. 

My routine has basically consisted of taking off my makeup with bioderma sebium, sometimes I used an Avene gel cleanser in the morning and then any random moisturiser (I've been trying to use up Avene Clearance Expert lotion- not my favourite tbh) for under my  makeup.  Super lazy... I guess I've paid the price for it.  I don't even know what's in the Avene products. 

While my skin was good, I think I used Nip+Fab Teen Skin Pore blaster/Bioderma Sebium, various glycolic acid products alternatively (mostly Alpha H liquid gold and the Nip+Fab pads), as well as Ren Clarimatte as my moisturiser.  Quite simple but was very effective!  I've loved the Ren gel cream for a looong time now, but find it a bit expensive so I tried finding cheaper alternatives many times, unsuccessfully.  My skin was still oily enough for me to use a powder foundation as my base since the natural oils on my skin would melt it very nicely after an hour or so. 

I started watching videos and reading posts on here and found out about The Ordinary. Someone I totally missed the existence of their products 'cause I wasn't keeping up with the beauty community much. I went a bit wild and bought basically everything of theirs to try. 

I started with trying out the Niacinimide+Zinc and Buffet along with the Natural Moisturizing Factors+HA cream. My pores instantly looked better so I kept using them for maybe 3 days. My cheeks magically looked smoothed out and my makeup had honestly never looked better on my cheeks.  

Then one evening I decided to slap on the AHA+BHA Peeling solution cause I felt like I had a lot of dead skin and textured bumps on my cheeks that could do with getting rid off, and while it didn't sting or anything I think my skin wasn't too happy with it. I hadn't used acid for a long time and it may have been a bit much. It was actually fine until I next applied the serums again in the morning, and realised anything I put on my skin would sting, including BB cream, and putting on the niacinamide caused huge red blotches to appear on my skin.  Unfortunately, during these couple of days I also had to bleach my roots and my skin got even angrier from the bleachy water running over my forehead as I washed it out.  I can't remember if I did this before or after the Peeling solution. My forehead hurt like crazy whenever anything touched it at this point.. 

For 2 days my forehead was super angry, dry and tight as if it was sunburnt but without the tan. I got a  couple of new spots on my cheeks that weren't there before. Bottom half of my face just got super dry and flakey. I did my best to get it to chill out my applying the oils I have on hand - Kiehl's midnight recovery and TO Rose Hip Seed Oil. I think this has mostly helped but I still have these weird cheek zits I don't normally get. 

I've kept reapplying the Rose Hip Seed Oil as soon as my face feels dry again and keeping it on overnight as it seems to be healing the irritation really well. Even though my face looks okay now like 3/4 days later, whenever I've tried to put on a bit of either the Niacinide or Buffet serums I experience stinging on my cheeks.  My skin has never been this dry and doesn't even look oily when I put the oil under my makeup as well as BB cream. Madness.  If there's anything else I can do I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice on what products to use. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - I'm looking for help on how to heal my irritated, stinging skin after over-using active ingredients (combined Niacinamide, Buffet and chemical peel in a  short space of time.. got a bit over-excited), and advice on whether I should keep using certain TO products or not!  Should I cut it out completely for a while or keep using them in small amount despite the slight stinging on application? 

My skin is normally not sensitive at all D: First time ever I've had this kind of reaction and even quite strong acids have not  caused stinging or irritation before.",1571299526.0,0.5,8
[routine help] How did you start your routine?,"I know the title sounds vague but I am new to everything. My skincare routine was Cetaphil face wash with Cetaphil lotion.

1. What made you want to start a skin care routine?
2. With the market flooded with varied products and fake reviews, how did you figure out which ones work/are worth it?
3. Is there a place to find suggestions for products targeting specific problems with reliable reviews?

"[acne] Simpler Is Sometimes Better, Your Skin Needs a Reset (The great skin barrier!)","Just thought I'd share my experience with chronic acne and some things Ive learned along the way. It might help some people figure out what is going on with their skin.  

So starting I am a 23 year old male. I always had acne prone skin but nothing major. I would look back to when I thought my skin was bad and I always thought I only wish I had that skin from x amount of years ago. Everyone freaks about their skin depending on what their baseline is. If they have perfect skin, one pimple can ruin your psyche and confidence but its all relative to the person. In the last few years it started getting really bad. Cystic acne along my neck and jawline and on random areas along my face. It was to the point where I was a shut in and didn't want to be social at a the worst time in my college life. Acne sucks and it can take a lot away from you and only people who suffer or have suffered from it know how much it can effect you. 

I tried so many different routines and antibiotics. My skin would respond well to certain treatments but I always would gain confidence in a routine and stray away. It was exhausting adhering to all these different products and routines. It was also very stressful to always have to think about washing my face properly and being so anal about anything and everything revolving my routine. While I was trying different routines and products, I'd go on extremely restrictive diets for months on end to try to also figure out if that was the core issue. I would worry about every little thing that went into my body and attribute every new break out to a potential slip up in my diet. 

I've seen so many people on this sub swear by outlandish routines and a plethora of products and at the end of the day if that works for you keep doing it. I am not here to try to tell people that this is HOW its done or is the sole reason or way to get your skin under control. At the end of the day good skin is a result of a lot of things and a lot has to do with genetics. 

Anyway here is what I have learned and my thoughts on my years of suffering from chronic acne: 

Almost everyone gets a break out(s) here or there and the reaction is usually irrational. Everyone looks for a quick fix or a product that can save their skin or calm down whatever has popped up. I believe this mentality and response is what starts people down a viscous cycle of ruining their baseline skin. I think my chronic acne was self inflicted. I remember times of clear skin and when I got a break out I would introduce new products and over wash my face to try to stop the storm.  It always seemed like my original problem areas would be where the acne stemmed. 

The main culprit:  
I think your natural skin barrier plays a huge role in the state of your skin. (skin barrier is just the natural barrier of your skin comprised of oils). A healthy permeable intact barrier will help keep the bad stuff out and the good stuff in.  If you are introducing new products with actives and over-washing your face your skin barrier is suffering dearly.

If you ever feel like you hop out of the shower with a super tight and irritated skin thats a tell tale sign there are problems. It may feel good to come out the shower with a ""squeaky"" clean feel because it appears like you are washing the bad stuff off.  I do not think this is an ideal state for your skin. Think about it like this, if you are constantly over drying your skin and adding moisture back in you are confusing your natural ability to maintain and control your oils.

My routine and final thoughts. 

Fixing your skin problems takes time. Be patient if you have disrupted your natural ability to regulate your skin barrier  it will take time to fix itself. Adhere to a simple routine that you can maintain and want to maintain. It will save you money, time and stress keeping it simple. 

The meat and potatoes of your routine or even your entire routine should just be:

Wash your face with a non irritating wash or none at all (I know scary) then apply a gentle non comedogenic basic moisturizer. Once you have stuck to the basics for a substantial amount of time, I promise you your face will be less angry, less broken out and a lot easier to maintain. You will still get breakouts and it will be an uphill battle but stick with it. Consider when you start any new routine, drug or medication for your acne. These will all take just as much time and you will be dependent and stressed out thinking about what is working or not working. Once you have stuck to this routine and created a good baseline for your skin, then you can consider adding actives and other acne fighting products to your routine. 

My routine now:

Morning: Not a damn thing 

Night: 

Wash face with clean hands (just lukewarm water) in the shower. Dry face as soon as possible. 

Why? Transepidermal water loss... This is when water dries on the surface of your skin. In this process the moisture is pulled from the epidermis and evaporates. 

After: Cerave PM, Paulas Choice 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide, Neutrogena Hydro Boost (In this order) 

If you have simplified your routine and adhered to it and you still have major problems, I think this is where you can start considering more aggressive treatments and potential external factors. (Allergies, hormones, Vitamin deficiencies, gut health). One thing simplifying your routine will do is eliminate all your speculations about what works or isn't working. 

End: Hopefully this helps one person fix their issues with their skin. I can say now I can go out in public and enjoy my life again. I still have scaring and hyperpigmentation I am dealing with but it is a relief to be where I am now. Of course I still get breakouts and my skin isn't perfect, but I am happier way less stressed out about everything as a whole. 

tldr: If you breakout chill out, there is no overnight fix, keep your routine simple and stick with it",1571290334.0,0.83,16

A few months before I turned  27 I noticed I was getting acne again and predominantly around my  temples and forehead. Even if I didnt touch the blemish it would still  leave a dark mark on my skin.

I eat very healthy, exercise, drink  loads of water, sleep so-so but too be fair over the past year I have  been slightly more stressed due to moving across the world back home and  getting a job in the movie industry (which is known to stressful). I  dont eat any dairy, low sugar, wash my face with sensitive face-wash,  use aloe vera and dont eat too much greasy food.

My  skin also seems to be far more oily and sweating even slightly gets my  skin super shiny and greasy. And a lot of the pimples I do get arent the  'popable' ones just big red bumps that leave a mark.

Edit: I’m 20F! Main issue is keeping acne from coming back.",1571282893.0,1.0,6
[Misc] Could I put an aha toner into and old setting spray bottle?,"Such as The Ordinarys 7% glycolic solution. I was interested in giving this product a go but I know myself and I know I tend to get lazy with products that require using cotton pads to apply. One thought I had was putting it into an old setting spray bottle, which I figured would make it super easy to apply, but I’m not sure if this would be effective. How much product would need to be distributed to be effective and would it be enough for maximum efficacy? Does it need to be rubbed into the skin? Also you obviously don’t have perfect control with a facial mist so is there any possibility of it doing any damage or drying it out if it got on my hair?",1571282718.0,1.0,8
[Routine Help] I need to start a proper skin care routine.,"For the past couple years, I've been switching around from using homemade sugar scrubs to Mario Badescu. I've never had a set skincare routine that isn't way too expensive or just let's my skin out of control. Right now, I'm using the equate version of Proactive and Garnier Skin Active lotion. I have combination skin and my biggest problem is blackheads/whiteheads and those small bumps on my forehead that aren't acne but still are pesky. Is there anything product or procedure that would help my skin? I'm open for any help or links! Thank you!",1571282179.0,0.33,1
"What should I add to routine to help bad PIH, with tret? [Routine Help]","So I've had a really bad breakout about last year and it left me with lots of PIH scars. Most of them has faded but now a few occasional pimples still leaves marks and it's frustrating.
Pih is really bad in my right cheek and I'm so insecure. It's grouped up and dark so people give me weird looks. :( Anyways...

Routine

Am- cleanse with acne free BP cleanser (love it)
TO niacinamide + zinc, wait 5-10 mins
CeraVe renewing night cream (love it)
And top it off with Skin aqua face milk spf 50++++

Pm- cleanse with same cleanser
Tret 0.025%, wait 40-60 mins
TO niacinamide + zinc again, wait 20 mins
Top it off with CeraVe salicylic acid/SA cream

What I need help with: I want to add something that will help with PIH, TO niacinamide had decent results but I'm pretty sure tret did most of the work. Also CeraVe sa cream burns sometimes with TO niacinamide if I don't spread it out enough maybe cause it has some acids like lactic that doesn't want to mix. But I wanna add something like alpha arbutin or azelaic acid (heard this was good) or TO hyaluronic + b5  (heard this was also good) or vitamin c but I heard that shouldn't mix with tret and I don't know how it would fit into my morning routine cuz I don't wanna get rid of niacinamide.

Don't want to get into actives or peels as I'm already using a lot of stuff. I have really oily asian skin especially the T-zone and is not sensetive. 

Any suggestions of advice would be greatly appreciated. <3",1571282062.0,0.5,4
[Skin Concerns] I scrubbed my face for a long time to remove a mole and now I have this rash/scrape on my face. Its been 32 hrs,"I recall scrubbing a mole out when I was younger so I tried it again. I have this mole in between my eyes and it is a very unattractive feature imo so I tried removing it (It was just a skin pigmentation, no bump). Unfortunately I didn't look online or anything and just went at it. 

Used water and half the the time used soap; scrubbed pretty hard for almost an hour. 


Good news? The mole seems to be gone. Bad news? I have this rash (not sure if its exactly a rash?) Its been 32 hrs at this point. I applied some petroleum jelly on it (3 times yesterday). It feels like there is a plastic mold on my face or something like that. If I widen my forehead, it feels like my skin is being stretched. Yesterday it was a bit moist and I would describe it as being similar to flesh-y? Not really but it was a little moist, less so today. 




I'm thinking of applying some neosporin today, what do you guys think?

[Product Question] Clinique iD vs. The Ordinary which is better?,"Hi all, 

I started using The Ordinary back in April ‘19 after lurking on this sub to clear up my skin and work on proper hydration. I used the products in their hydrating regimen for 90 days and I found a profound improvement in my overall skin health. My face was more moisture rich and I basically never break out. I have continued to use this regimen to maintain my skin and am happy with it. Now that I have my basics covered I’ve been looking to refine more of my skin such as redness, pore size, and brightness. I’ve done some research and have basically decided to either try Clinique iD or The Ordinary. 

With Clinique iD I feel like you’re only getting one benefit depending on what insert you choose. I also have never tried Clinique skincare products before. I’ll [link](https://m.clinique.com/cliniqueid?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8r23-pei5QIVjMDACh1kyg6cEAAYASAAEgLwq_D_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)the product in case you are wondering what it is. 

With The Ordinary I feel like I can mix and match serums and things to tackle a lot of problems all at once. I’ve had a good experience with their products and it comes at a nice price. However, I’m still unsure if this is what I want to use or if it’d be possible to tackle those things more quickly using the ordinary. 

I’m not looking for a quick fix, I know it will take time. I just want to compound the results if I can! If anyone’s used one or both products, has experience, advice, or general knowledge I’d love to hear it.

[Product Question] Does this Vitamin C product sound okay or should I look for something else?,"Does this product sound okay? Thoughts / opinions would be really helpful.

I just picked up ASDA Brightening Vitamin C Glow Boosting Gel Mask. I have been looking for something with Vitamin C and this was only £2.50 so put it in my basket. After looking at the ingredients I’d love to know your thoughts:
