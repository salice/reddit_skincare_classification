1,"I’m a 26y female. I have always struggled with mild breakouts. I currently use adapalene .3% gel along with clindamycin pads. I’ve been using these products for about 5 years. I get a facial once a month and use eminence products. Have been getting facials for about two years now. I still constantly struggle with breakouts around my chin. I’m not sure if it’s hormonal because they are not cystic and the breakouts don’t change with my cycle. These are very mild breakouts but I’m so frustrated with constantly having 3-5 pimples on my face. The rest of my face is fine,the breakouts are confined to mainly my chin. I don’t consume a lot of dairy or alcohol. Considering switching to getting medical grade facials, hydra facials, and/or chemical peels.

2,"Really considering getting Liquid Gold, as I love the Soft Touch AHA and enjoy the Rewind, although I hate the texture and will probably be getting Shark Sauce after this bottle runs out.  I've heard Liquid Gold being touted as a HG for overexfoliated, dehydrated, and sensitive skin, and I'm currently experiencing a bit of skin itchiness after going a bit hard on the AHA.  Liquid Gold seems to have every ingredient checked off of my ""dream ingredient list"", with ceramides, rosehip oil, niacinamide, urea, etc.  

However, I'm reading a lot of mixed opinions online (and believe me, I've read as many as I can find) in regards to the color of the product.  As someone whose skin tone is only slightly more tan than Casper the Friendly Ghost with Rosacea-like redness to boot, I'm worried that I'm going to put on this amazing product but never be able to wear it outside for the risk of looking like I painted my face yellow for a Pittsburgh Steelers game.  Another issue is that I'm pretty fond of my all-white pillows and bedsheets, and it would be infuriating to constantly have to bleach my bedding because I wake up with a pillowcase smeared in yellow marks.  

Anyone with experience with Liquid Gold, is the color a legit issue I should consider?  Or am I being dramatic and is this a HG product I need to jump on pronto?",1571340932.0,[Product Question] Stratia Liquid Gold - is the color an issue?,1.0

1,"okay so I'll try to keep it short. I'm acne prone but for the past few months I've had super clear skin until I traveled to Spain and back home. got two new face demons but that's not my issue, the issue is that whenever I get some kind of pimple, acne, cyst or whatsoever I leave it alone unless it has come to a head and then I'll try to pop it the right way. point is, whether I pop it or just leave it alone, the moment it heals it leaves a bump after a few weeks and I can still feel the content inside. it doesn't matter if I popped it or not it just heals like that. like the content in it is the same as whiteheads.

•Apply coconut oil to dissolve makeup
•Use Neogen Green Tea Fresh Foaming Cleanser

1,"Helpppp my skin is a mess right now. I can't tell if it is dehydrated or not. 
Right now, it has a lot of PIE, splotchyness and like a few whiteheads. I struggle with hormonal acne and unfortunately due to medications I am on and some medical conditions, I can't really take much to deal with it. 
It is fall now, and my skin looks congested, splotchy and red with PIE or maybe PIH.. not sure. MY current routine has worked for me last winter and fall... Especially my nighttime one. My skin usually looks hydrated and even when I wake up.. I will occasionally get a zit.. but my skin will still look fine. During the day... is when my skin FREAKS. As of right now, my skin feels tight under my makeup. 

Only new products I use is the sunscreen, Purito Centella Ampoule, Astral Cream Holy Snails Eldorado and IUNIK Tea tree ampoule. I patch tested them all. The Purito occassionally makes my skin sting. 

Here is a photo https://imgur.com/a/5DXA77K,

Currently my routine is : 

AM: 

1) Rinse with water. 

2) Occassionally I will use BR p50 (the sensitive skin formula) But I can't use it often else my skin freaks 

3) One layer of Kikumasamune 

4) One to two layers of Klairs Supple Prep Unscented 

5) CosRx Snail Essence 

6) One drop of IUnik Tea Tree mixed with a drop of Purito Centella ampoule. 

7) IUnik Propolis serum or Benton Snail Bee Ultimate Serum 

8) If I am feeling up for it I will add HolySnails Shark Sauce 

9) Two drops of my own mixture of oil (Tamanu, Pomogranate, Cammelia) mixed with a drop of Stratia Fortify and a drop of Holy Snails El Dorado - Occasionally I will massage with a guashua 

This is where I really load up on moisturizers here: 

10) Mizon Snail AIO black 

11) Stratia Liquid Gold 

12) A personal mixed concoction of Cerave Baby cream and La Roche Posay Cicaplast or Cicaplast Accelerateur (Occlusive) 

13) If I am wearing makeup (Which I usually am) Astral Cream. (Use to use Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, heard this was a dupe, it is not..) 

14) Current Sunscreen - Purito Centella Unscented Sunscreen. I also sometimes use Missha Flash Sunscreen. 

15) Primer 

Right now.. my skin feels tight.. like my foundation is just not sticking to my skin...

1,"Hello all-

Over the summer I was diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis, so I had to change my whole routine to be fungal safe. I've always been oily, but recently it's been INSANE. Like, makeup gone off my forehead and nose within an hour or two of applying. (Same foundation and powder I've been using for years)

My skin is not dehydrated as far as I can tell. No redness, flaking, tightness etc. 

my current routine is

AM: 
-Rinse with warm water (mostly to remove vaseline from PM) 
-Garnier Oily skin micellar water (in green bottle)

I know I need to add a sunscreen, but I'm working on finding a fungal safe one that will work for  my skin

PM: 
-Vanicream Gentle cleanser (w/ Clarisonic 3x/week)
-Stridex (red box) 
-Sebamed Clear Face Gel
-Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment around eyes/healing pimples etc


I'm just kind of at a loss as to what I should change/add to deal with this oil. I'm currently going through at least 5 blotting sheets per work day. I've pretty much given up on base makeup, so I just blot and powder every hour or so and end up looking super flat/cakey. 

I recently tried The Ordinary Niacinimide, and I didn't notice any difference. I think it also made me break out a bit.

**Feeling lost**

so after switching dermatologist for the third time I finally found one that listened to me (or tried) and didn’t put me on Accutane, she sent me Adapalene 0.3 and spiro 100 mg but sha gave me some weird ass advices.

**Skin background**: my hormonal acne problem started since I was 17(25 now) after trying everything people told me dove soap, sulfur soap, lemon, toothpaste ... (yes, I’m sorry for my skin) I decided that was time to see the derm. what I remember from this *first appointment* is that he immediately send me Accutane for a year, sunscreen everyday (local brand) and washing face day and night with Neutrogena salicylic acid cleanser and YES no moisturizer , as expected my skin cleared up but after a few months after I finished the treatment my hormonal acne came back EVEN WORSE. After that I *switched dermatologist for the second time* and yes again Accutane this time 4 months, stopping 1 month and continuing with other 6 months she told me to keep using the same sunscreen and Neutrogena cleanser (no moisturizer) long story short my acne came back like 10 times worse, my combined skin became dry and dehydrated and super sensitive (first perioral dermatitis rushes I’ve ever had).

after that I kind of lost faith and started my skincare journey by myself I found out about **Reddit** and I can’t say how much this community changed things for good, I started to remove make up properly, to use moisturizer and just washing my face at nights my hormonal acne was still there but at least my face was hydrated and looking healthy, after a lot of trial and error I found the triggers of my perioral dermatitis(tea tree oil and sodium lauryl sulfate) and found my worst enemy ***BUTYLENE GLYCOl*** , after almost going crazy wondering why if I was using gentle products why my skin was so itchy and I was getting so much closed comedones I switched products like crazy spent so much money until (thanks do incidecoder.cosdna,skincarisma) I made the connection to butylene glycol. Now I’ve been 3 months BG free (this was so difficult it’s almost in every product) and no more closed comedones and itchiness.

Some model friend recommended a good dermatologist who helped with her hormonal acne. **third dermatologist,** she actually listened to me didn’t put me on Accutane, she actually believed my allergy to BG, send me adapalene .3 and spiro and sent me a list of recommended products for a new routine, on the other hand she told me not to use moisturizer (I don’t know why they want to dry the hell out of my skin when it’s not even oily) I told her that I wanted to use moisturizer so she send 2 recommendations one with butylene glycol (so she didn’t take the time to check the ingredient list of her recommendations) and the other contains lactic acid (I’m pretty sure that if I’m on adapalene using other acids will irritate my skin) she told me to use moisturizer just the nights that I’m **not** using adapalene (3xweek), told me to change my beloved Vanicream gentle cleanser for an expensive avene cleanser that contains fragance ... and to use it twice a day (again ), she recommended Eucerin sun face oil control dry touch spf 50 (contains alcohol denat). I could email her telling all of this and asking for more recommendation but I lost faith again 

**ROUTINE (third week on adapelene .3) everything its butylene glycol free**

2,"I guess I'll start with a bit of the story on what lead up to this? 

 I used to be quite into my skincare but I fell off the wagon a bit while living with my (now ex) boyfriend.  I recently met a guy I really like and he was one of the few people to guess my age correctly like, ever.  In the UK there is this law that you can be asked for ID for energy drinks and the age limit is 16-  I have been refused sales of red bull before when I forgot my ID, because I'm small and blonde and look young in general. So when this guy correctly said I'm 23/24 it was a massive kick up my butt to get my shit together again.   I have to admit, my skin has been quite bad lately, with a bunch of hormonal acne spots on my chin and some around my forehead.  My forehead has become oily while my cheeks look bumpy and textured/congested . I've been previously diagnosed with KP as a child and still get it a little bit around my face.  Horrible combination of oily and dry at the same time in different areas. I'm not sure what has caused these to come up all of a sudden but I imagine it's that I haven't been using any products with anything active in them lately. 

My routine has basically consisted of taking off my makeup with bioderma sebium, sometimes I used an Avene gel cleanser in the morning and then any random moisturiser (I've been trying to use up Avene Clearance Expert lotion- not my favourite tbh) for under my  makeup.  Super lazy... I guess I've paid the price for it.  I don't even know what's in the Avene products. 

While my skin was good, I think I used Nip+Fab Teen Skin Pore blaster/Bioderma Sebium, various glycolic acid products alternatively (mostly Alpha H liquid gold and the Nip+Fab pads), as well as Ren Clarimatte as my moisturiser.  Quite simple but was very effective!  I've loved the Ren gel cream for a looong time now, but find it a bit expensive so I tried finding cheaper alternatives many times, unsuccessfully.  My skin was still oily enough for me to use a powder foundation as my base since the natural oils on my skin would melt it very nicely after an hour or so. 

I started watching videos and reading posts on here and found out about The Ordinary. Someone I totally missed the existence of their products 'cause I wasn't keeping up with the beauty community much. I went a bit wild and bought basically everything of theirs to try. 

I started with trying out the Niacinimide+Zinc and Buffet along with the Natural Moisturizing Factors+HA cream. My pores instantly looked better so I kept using them for maybe 3 days. My cheeks magically looked smoothed out and my makeup had honestly never looked better on my cheeks.  

Then one evening I decided to slap on the AHA+BHA Peeling solution cause I felt like I had a lot of dead skin and textured bumps on my cheeks that could do with getting rid off, and while it didn't sting or anything I think my skin wasn't too happy with it. I hadn't used acid for a long time and it may have been a bit much. It was actually fine until I next applied the serums again in the morning, and realised anything I put on my skin would sting, including BB cream, and putting on the niacinamide caused huge red blotches to appear on my skin.  Unfortunately, during these couple of days I also had to bleach my roots and my skin got even angrier from the bleachy water running over my forehead as I washed it out.  I can't remember if I did this before or after the Peeling solution. My forehead hurt like crazy whenever anything touched it at this point.. 

For 2 days my forehead was super angry, dry and tight as if it was sunburnt but without the tan. I got a  couple of new spots on my cheeks that weren't there before. Bottom half of my face just got super dry and flakey. I did my best to get it to chill out my applying the oils I have on hand - Kiehl's midnight recovery and TO Rose Hip Seed Oil. I think this has mostly helped but I still have these weird cheek zits I don't normally get. 

I've kept reapplying the Rose Hip Seed Oil as soon as my face feels dry again and keeping it on overnight as it seems to be healing the irritation really well. Even though my face looks okay now like 3/4 days later, whenever I've tried to put on a bit of either the Niacinide or Buffet serums I experience stinging on my cheeks.  My skin has never been this dry and doesn't even look oily when I put the oil under my makeup as well as BB cream. Madness.  If there's anything else I can do I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice on what products to use. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - I'm looking for help on how to heal my irritated, stinging skin after over-using active ingredients (combined Niacinamide, Buffet and chemical peel in a  short space of time.. got a bit over-excited), and advice on whether I should keep using certain TO products or not!  Should I cut it out completely for a while or keep using them in small amount despite the slight stinging on application?

16,"Just thought I'd share my experience with chronic acne and some things Ive learned along the way. It might help some people figure out what is going on with their skin.  

So starting I am a 23 year old male. I always had acne prone skin but nothing major. I would look back to when I thought my skin was bad and I always thought I only wish I had that skin from x amount of years ago. Everyone freaks about their skin depending on what their baseline is. If they have perfect skin, one pimple can ruin your psyche and confidence but its all relative to the person. In the last few years it started getting really bad. Cystic acne along my neck and jawline and on random areas along my face. It was to the point where I was a shut in and didn't want to be social at a the worst time in my college life. Acne sucks and it can take a lot away from you and only people who suffer or have suffered from it know how much it can effect you. 

I tried so many different routines and antibiotics. My skin would respond well to certain treatments but I always would gain confidence in a routine and stray away. It was exhausting adhering to all these different products and routines. It was also very stressful to always have to think about washing my face properly and being so anal about anything and everything revolving my routine. While I was trying different routines and products, I'd go on extremely restrictive diets for months on end to try to also figure out if that was the core issue. I would worry about every little thing that went into my body and attribute every new break out to a potential slip up in my diet. 

I've seen so many people on this sub swear by outlandish routines and a plethora of products and at the end of the day if that works for you keep doing it. I am not here to try to tell people that this is HOW its done or is the sole reason or way to get your skin under control. At the end of the day good skin is a result of a lot of things and a lot has to do with genetics. 

Anyway here is what I have learned and my thoughts on my years of suffering from chronic acne: 

Almost everyone gets a break out(s) here or there and the reaction is usually irrational. Everyone looks for a quick fix or a product that can save their skin or calm down whatever has popped up. I believe this mentality and response is what starts people down a viscous cycle of ruining their baseline skin. I think my chronic acne was self inflicted. I remember times of clear skin and when I got a break out I would introduce new products and over wash my face to try to stop the storm.  It always seemed like my original problem areas would be where the acne stemmed. 

The main culprit:  
I think your natural skin barrier plays a huge role in the state of your skin. (skin barrier is just the natural barrier of your skin comprised of oils). A healthy permeable intact barrier will help keep the bad stuff out and the good stuff in.  If you are introducing new products with actives and over-washing your face your skin barrier is suffering dearly.

If you ever feel like you hop out of the shower with a super tight and irritated skin thats a tell tale sign there are problems. It may feel good to come out the shower with a ""squeaky"" clean feel because it appears like you are washing the bad stuff off.  I do not think this is an ideal state for your skin. Think about it like this, if you are constantly over drying your skin and adding moisture back in you are confusing your natural ability to maintain and control your oils.

My routine and final thoughts. 

Fixing your skin problems takes time. Be patient if you have disrupted your natural ability to regulate your skin barrier  it will take time to fix itself. Adhere to a simple routine that you can maintain and want to maintain. It will save you money, time and stress keeping it simple. 

The meat and potatoes of your routine or even your entire routine should just be:

Wash your face with a non irritating wash or none at all (I know scary) then apply a gentle non comedogenic basic moisturizer. Once you have stuck to the basics for a substantial amount of time, I promise you your face will be less angry, less broken out and a lot easier to maintain. You will still get breakouts and it will be an uphill battle but stick with it. Consider when you start any new routine, drug or medication for your acne. These will all take just as much time and you will be dependent and stressed out thinking about what is working or not working. Once you have stuck to this routine and created a good baseline for your skin, then you can consider adding actives and other acne fighting products to your routine. 

My routine now:

Morning: Not a damn thing 

Night: 

Wash face with clean hands (just lukewarm water) in the shower. Dry face as soon as possible. 

Why? Transepidermal water loss... This is when water dries on the surface of your skin. In this process the moisture is pulled from the epidermis and evaporates. 

After: Cerave PM, Paulas Choice 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide, Neutrogena Hydro Boost (In this order) 

If you have simplified your routine and adhered to it and you still have major problems, I think this is where you can start considering more aggressive treatments and potential external factors. (Allergies, hormones, Vitamin deficiencies, gut health). One thing simplifying your routine will do is eliminate all your speculations about what works or isn't working. 

End: Hopefully this helps one person fix their issues with their skin. I can say now I can go out in public and enjoy my life again. I still have scaring and hyperpigmentation I am dealing with but it is a relief to be where I am now. Of course I still get breakouts and my skin isn't perfect, but I am happier way less stressed out about everything as a whole.

What I need help with: I want to add something that will help with PIH, TO niacinamide had decent results but I'm pretty sure tret did most of the work. Also CeraVe sa cream burns sometimes with TO niacinamide if I don't spread it out enough maybe cause it has some acids like lactic that doesn't want to mix.

Don't want to get into actives or peels as I'm already using a lot of stuff. I have really oily asian skin especially the T-zone and is not sensetive.

Used water and half the the time used soap; scrubbed pretty hard for almost an hour. 


Good news? The mole seems to be gone. Bad news? I have this rash (not sure if its exactly a rash?) Its been 32 hrs at this point. I applied some petroleum jelly on it (3 times yesterday).

With The Ordinary I feel like I can mix and match serums and things to tackle a lot of problems all at once. I’ve had a good experience with their products and it comes at a nice price. However, I’m still unsure if this is what I want to use or if it’d be possible to tackle those things more quickly using the ordinary.

1,"okay, I'm probably going to book a dermatologist appt. this week. and I'm also going to go in extreme depth but I'll give a tl;dr because I'm extremely concerned, this could be a multitude of things.

tl;dr, my face turns red, super hot, and discolored and gets cystic patches of acne for like a week and then completely goes away.

longer in depth version. my skin is sensitive, dry, and acne prone, I found a routine and products that have done absolute wonders and don't irritate it or make it worse, and I've been using these products for about half a year, some longer than that. my acne has basically gone away, the texture is smoother than I thought possible, and the complexion/redness has disappeared. it feels like a miracle. HOWEVER. (and I posted this in a daily questions thread so if it sounds familiar that's why) typically like every month or so, give or take a few weeks, my skin gets a cystic break out (it's also always clustered to one place but I also get smaller pimples all over) and it doesn't correlate at all with my period, trust me, I've looked into it, and there's no connection. along with a cystic breakout, my skin turns extremely red. my neck isn't affected at all, it starts on my chin and above my jawline. and I use the EXACT same products and routine on my neck/chest. it's red as if it's extremely flushed all over, but the worst is my cheeks. and I don't wanna say it gets ""hyperpigmented"" because that tends to stay, but, my skin also gets a few shades darker, it literally looks like I have a tan, and I definitely don't bc I either just don't go outside in the sun and if I have to I wear a hat and sunscreen because I'm transparently pale. it also gets extremely hot to the touch. my whole face feels like I have a fever, not just to the touch but just sitting here it feels super hot. and I think it's just an illusion but the texture of my skin also looks bad.

so basically 4 simultaneous symptoms, redness, discoloration, acne, and heat. it happens every month(ish) or longer, and it always goes away within a week. this episode has been going on for about 3 days so far. and I've ruled so many things out.

it's not my period. it's not the products, because this predates that, I never switch them up, been using them a long time, and also apply them to my neck (my skin also looks totally fine after my skincare routine night & day during these episodes, I can even stay up like 3 or 4 hrs after my night routine and the whole time my face looks totally normal. it only happens during the day and just gets progressively worse.) it's not my pillowcase, the detergent, shampoo, cleaning products, diet, hand soap, blankets, etc. I've ruled all of that out. for a long time I thought I was just too hot, so I kept a fan on and stayed really cooled off, but it didn't make a difference. my mom suggested it might be windburn from the fan but it was happening before that. even if I keep the central AC super low it doesn't help. (but it does get WAYYY worse when the heat is on or I'm hot) I considered the fact that it was blood pressure or high heart rate, but I ruled that out as well considering I can be very relaxed and feel my pulse and it's calm, and my face is beet red. and when this isn't happening I can be extremely anxious with a high heart rate, and look normal. like I said, it's not a sunburn either, despite looking just like one. I don't go in the sun, period. my lymph nodes aren't swollen, nothing is swollen. I have no other symptoms of anything. I do work out every day for about 40 minutes and try to walk a mile every other day, but it has no correlation to that either, it makes no difference besides a very typical slightly red cheeks and sweat that only lasts about 10-15 mins after the workout whether I'm having one of these ""episodes"" or not. I also considered the possibility of it being makeup, which would be a stretch because I go through phases of zero makeup and then just eyeliner, brows, and highlight, (no foundation, no primer) and not only is highlighter the only ""face"" makeup I ever use, but it doesn't correlate at all and I use multiple brands/formulas.

I think I said this in a question thread but the ONLY thing I can think of is that it could be rosacea and these are flair ups. but from the photos I've seen of rosacea, this doesn't look like that. I don't see any blood vessels, it's just red and tan-ish. (also I think my dad had mild rosacea but his never got better or worse) every time this happens I panic and convince myself my skin is ruined and I decide to book a dermatologist apt. but it always goes away within a week and it takes a month or longer to get in with the only good dermatologist here.

the products I use are - cerave hydrating cleanser (2xdaily and this happened long before using that) kiehl's ultra facial toner (night only and I've used it for 2 yrs)  klair's vitamin c serum (every other night only and this long predates using that) cerave AM moisturizer (2xdaily and also predates that) and in the past month I incorporated the ordinary's azelaic acid chemical exfoliater, I've used it 3 or 4 times, (typically once a week and never mixed with the serum) no negative reaction, works super well, and obviously this problem predates that. my mom has also thought it's the products, but not only have I not noticed a correlation, but this predates basically all of them, they've all helped my skin like crazy, and the last few times this happened I stopped using them and slowly reincorporated them back to test for a reaction and it made no difference. it lasted a week and went away regardless.

if you need more info I'm happy to provide, I just desperately want answers or suggestions. I'm probably going to book a dermatologist apt. tomorrow and just bring in photos. also I'll edit this post later and post a photo when I can. please let me know if anyone has any ideas of what this could be or if you've ever experienced it. anything is appreciated.

I’ll do my best to cut to the chase but forgive me if I rant a bit. I think this cyst started following my Accutane treatment, but it’s been so long I honestly can’t remember exactly. It was flesh-colored, firm, and not painful or tender at all even when I touch it. I honestly don’t think it has ever come to a head—looking back on it I am pretty sure the one “pop” I had was just a pimple right next to its location and not related in any way. My previous dermatologist recommended that my only options were to leave it alone or have it removed surgically—I’ve had other stubborn cyst sites injected with cortisone shots and its been incredibly effective in the past, but he never really explained himself as to why he did not feel that was an option. I didn’t press since 9 times out of 10 I had more serious acne issues to worry about.

Fast forward to today and with my skin finally in a decent position (after years of battle) I’m trying to go after these other lingering issues. I saw another dermatologist since my usual one is now prohibitively far away, and I figured I could benefit from a fresh set of eyes. He offered me a cortisone shot for the beast, and probably against my better judgement and the judgement of my previous dermatologist I accepted. Long story short, after almost 72 hours the cyst is probably worse and just looks like its old self with more irritation and swelling. I’m fortunate to have decent insurance that allows me to see a dermatologist, but it really feels like my only option is to surgically remove this thing. I hate how it looks but that’s a hard sell considering that could cost thousands of dollars (I don’t think it would be covered by insurance) and would certainly leave a scar behind. In the meantime, do you guys have any topical treatment ideas I could use to at least shrink it down and reduce the irritation? Has anything worked for you guys on similar problem areas? I’ve googled extensively but I can find very little on this type of cyst or cortisone shots being completely ineffective. I know topical treatments are kind of a long shot, but I’m emotionally drained by this thing and really feel like I need to be doing something.

I use tretinoin 0.05% gel most nights but have taken a break from it for the past 2 weeks as rhe side effects were getting too much.

I avoid being out in the sun for long periods and avoid using soap as par my dermatologist’s recommendation to avoid acne and drying out my skin.

7,"Hello everyone, I have a lot of trouble with cystic acne on my chin, and I recently tried a routine that actually worked for me! 

I’ve tried so many things in the past, but the only thing that every really worked was just waiting it out. Super frustrating, especially the self-restraint to not even touch it.

Yesterday I noticed another cyst forming, and started preparing myself to deal with a second chin growing out of my face for a week. However, I decided to try something different in hopes of shrinking the bump. When I woke up this morning, the bump was nearly gone!! I am so thrilled, I decided to post here for the first time! Here’s the routine I used, and I hope it’s successful for any of you too:

1. Washed my face with belif aqua bomb jelly cleanser, using my pmd clean Smart Facial Cleansing Device (I’ve had this little scrubber about 3 months, and really noticed a reduction in general congestion)
2. Exfoliated with the pmd Personal Microderm Device (I’ve only used this a couple times because I’m scared of scraping off too much, but I’ll definitely be incorporating it into my routine about once every 2 weeks from now on)
3. Put a few drops of tea tree oil mixed into water on a cotton pad, and rubbed it on the cystic acne
4. Rubbed in a few drops of Sunday Riley UFO Acne Treatment Face Oil (my skin is already oily, so this is what I use as a moisturizer when it’s hot, like it still is in Southern California) using the back side of the pmd Smart Facial Cleansing Device
5. Applied an acne sticker (I use Avarelle because they’re like $5 on amazon, but I think any kind would work) 
6. Went to bed, and woke up to normal-sized chin!

Honestly, I was so surprised it worked. This is almost life changing for me. The acne isn’t entirely gone, but it’s shrunk to such a degree that it’s not even noticeable anymore. I hope this helps anyone else who gets cystic acne!",1571266889.0,[acne] Clearing cystic acne,0.86

I've  had regularly occuring pimples on my upper back, butt, and more  recently along the length of my spine. I think I was actually lurking  here looking for face cream reviews or something, and ended up reading a  post about bath routines. I was never particularly loyal to shower  gels, just had always used them for the convenience, and after reading  that post I picked up a bar of tumeric infused soap for $4...

I  felt a pimple on my back yesterday, which was bad news. But I then  realized it was the first one that had shown up in several months, when I  had been used to about a handful a week.

It's been about 1 year and 10 months now since I started my skincare journey, and about 6 weeks since the year-long breakout of cystic acne along my jaw line cleared up. I was having dinner with my husband who suddenly looked at me said ""your skin looks really clean. Like, luminous."" I can't express how much it means to hear him say that, especially since I've lately just focused on keeping my skin clear rather than messing with it with too many products in my efforts to achieve ""perfect"" skin. Just wanted to share, as someone who thought I would never get to this point.

EDIT: Adding my routine below, as many were asking.I started with skincare after hearing about the infamous Korean 10 step routine, went on a few benders and am now recovering. For the past few months, I've been trying to find more western, or European, brands to work into my routine - mostly for environmental reasons. The Asian product you see mentioned below are my HG's that I just can't find myself letting go of. My current routine is literally based on things my skin seems to like, and I'm being very cautious about adding new products as I really, really do not want to trigger another breakout.

Long story short, my skin was constantly breaking out from 2016-2018, and some of the blemishes were deep and lasted a long time. I had a cystic (I believe) pimple on my chin in 2017 that took ages and ages to heal, then got another one in the same place. It finally healed, and left a small round slightly visible shiny mark- most likely a scar, but it's been there for quite some time now and hasn't faded with any of my acids over time, nothing. It stays there while my skin breaks out on occasion and heals in other areas. It only recently occurred to me that a mark like that could possibly be something worse, even though I know in my rational mind that it was a gnarly cyst and it's most likely scar tissue. The fact that it hasn't changed at all in two years is making me less worried, actually. I was stupid and messed with it the other day, and (I apologize) some clear stuff came out and it's scabby again, but it seems as though the mark itself is still there and isn't raised or red like a normal zit, which again makes me think it's scar tissue, but I tricked myself into worrying about it. Has anyone else had similar marks that never really went away from nasty zits, or should I ask a professional to look at it? Thank you!

**Texture and Smell**: 
Right away there is no strong scent to this product. Texture is pretty easy to describe as that of a light oil. This is not thick or heavy at all and is a bit runnier than some might anticipate and I find that it can easily slip and slide between my fingers as I’m massaging it into my face and it will trickle down the backs of my hands pretty fast. 
Because of this, it is very easy to spread, having a lot of ‘slip’ to it. I love this and find it perfect for extended facial massages that do not feel that I am tugging or pulling the skin in any way.
 
**Performance**: 
I’ve now gotten back into wearing makeup pretty much daily and I wear SPF 99% of the time, no matter what I am doing. Makeup can range from a very light mineral powder to liquid foundation with generous helpings of mascara on the lashes. This oil was the first one I found that actually did a number on the famous Heroine Mascara and while, lately, I have found Heroine winning once again, I can’t deny that this product does do a very good job at cleaning the bulk of it off and thus, cleaning my face well. 
In winter, I do not find I need to second cleanse with this. As I said before, it ensures there are no traces of makeup or spf left on my face and this product emulsifies and rinses off incredibly well. There is no perceptible oily residue on the skin. I say perceptible because while I can’t seem to see or feel it, I notice in Summer I do need to wash with a foaming cleanser or I am prone to a few whiteheads on my chin which could mean there is the tiniest hint of oil being left on my face which summer/high humidity me doesn’t seem to agree with? Very odd. 
I find I can get a lot of grits with this with very little pressure. This is insanely satisfying for me as it really helps me believe that this product is cleaning out my skin as deeply as it possibly can. 
Around the eyes, this is gentle and does not irritate. However, due to its slippy nature it can get between my lids and causes me a bit of blurry vision and stinging on my actual eyeball which I feel is to be expected when this happens. Don’t be like me – close your eyes tight and try not to dig your fingers all up in your lash bed and therefore all up in your eyeball.
 
**Time used**: 
I am now on my .. gosh 7th or 8th bottle of this stuff (inc refill bags as a “bottle). I’d wager the bottle lasts me roughly 3 ish months with daily use? I would also say that I am fairly generous with how much I use – almost if not 3 full pumps whereas I wager a lot of people could get by on 1.5 – 2. I think I can safely say it’s love and long term at that!
 
**Comparison of new vs old formula** 
No difference to me. Absolutely none. Everything I have written above and in my final thoughts below can be applied to both products. The only notable difference, I found on Ratzilla’s summary of it, is inclusion of more hyaluronic acid but again, I do not see anything better or worse comparing the formulas.

**Final Thoughts** 
This is an absolute holy grail product for me and you will see me recommend it often – 10/10, A+, High Distinction whatever grading rubric you prefer. I personally feel that with all the online options we have, it is available as well as being very budget friendly for cost per mL as well as how long the product actually lasts you.

i've never been the one to get forehead acne, at most it would be 1-2 pimples that would go away after several days. and this would rarely ever happen. in my teen years, i had a period of breakouts that would appear on the side of my face and it was pretty bad. my most recent struggles with pimples was about 3 years ago where i had a lot of pimples under my chin, but i think that was due to shaving without shaving cream and not properly disinfecting razors. the side and under my chin acne have all gone away however.

but now ever since June, forehead acne started happening a lot more often, i would get the 1-2 pimples, they would go away after several days, but would come back about a week or two later.

this cycle has been on repeat and is still going on now, but this time currently going through my worst breakout yet as it seems like it is only getting worse.

i have never used any products before as i would just wash my face with water every night and ever morning when i wake up; however, in July, i invested in Neutroena Pore Refining Exfoliating Cleanser because i thought it would help. i have been using this every night by wetting my face, applying it on my fingers and rubbing it in circles all over my face, specifically on my forehead and letting it rest for about 10-20 seconds before i rinse it off, with little to no help.

my current breakout started last sunday on 10/6 with two pimples on my forehead. i noticed them appear the next day on 10/7 after eating In N Out the previous day (though this never was an issue i had before). now not only are the pimples still here, but more have come to my forehead as you can see in the last picture in the link.

i haven't made any lifestyle changes and my diet is still the same. there has been no drastic changes in my life that would lead to me answers why i started getting forehead acne so this is why i'm asking what people on reddit think or for any advice. i've never been to a dermatologist before but if this keeps persisting, i feel like that may be the best option.",1571252395.0,[Acne] 22M who recently started having forehead acne. need opinions/advice please.

Hi!

I’m two weeks into epiduo. I have used this before and stopped completely back in June/July (thought I didn’t need it any longer) and was carrying on with my normal routine of TO lactic acid 5% & azelaic acid suspension PM and vitamin C & alpha arbitun AM, which are my staple. Have seriously transformed my skin! 

During the summer I was trialing TTO as a toner (stopped due to irritation) and TO squalene oil (stopped due to CCs).  

So to cut the long story, I have started using epiduo again & all these tiny bumps are coming to the surfaces, some as whiteheads or tiny blackheads, which I know is good but man if it isn’t rough :(.  Plus I have a wedding to go to next week & I’m not up for it at all. 

I’m really frustrated at myself for stopping the epiduo in the first place, but I thought since I already had an exfoliant I didn’t need it - I guess my skin relies heavily on the cream then I thought. Lesson learnt I suppose ...

How did you get through your purge?

I’m light skinned so white casts aren’t too much of a problem to me. However, I’m frequently outdoors so the wear time and waterproof/sweat-proofness matter to me a lot. It would be good also if these worked well with light makeup (cream blushes, occasional concealer).

My current options are
- Innisfree Triple care
- Avene Very High Protection Cream (is this mineral or chemical?)

I hope you're doing well. I'm feeling a bit under the weather, so I could use the warm blaze and comforting crackle of a nice fire today.

Which is good, because we have a wonderful little (spooky) [Fireside Chat](https://media.giphy.com/media/3NeU6RmIyJqHpTmiAQ/giphy.gif) planned!

## **Looking back: what we've done**

Let's start with a look back. A big project /u/scumteam14 and I undertook was updating the organisation of the sidebar and making the wiki easier to navigate. We realised that even though we have lots of good information, it might not be very easy to find - so we wanted to change that. We also made a change to make the sidebar more visible for mobile users - which is to add an Automod sticky comment on every post with a few helpful links.

Ideally, reddit would give us a better option for presenting information to mobile users, but at the moment we felt that this was the best option.

I'm definitely interested to know how people who frequent the sub often experience that sticky comment. I wonder if you get used to it, like it becomes background noise, or whether you find it intrusive and whether it negatively impacts your experience in ScA.

Another thing we did was add and train a new mod! /u/mastiii has been a very loyal and active ScA'er, being the only person to get a Helpful User badge three years in a row. I'm happy to report they're doing great as a mod :) We're planning to continue adding new mods - the more the merrier!

## **Let's talk: design contest**

Let's look at the (near) future! We've had our current banner for…. I think as long as the subreddit exists? At least as long as I've known it, which is fffffive years. Oh god.

Anyway, it could definitely do with an update! Same goes for the snoo (on legacy) and the subreddit icon (on redesign/mobile).

Now, we do have a moderator with great design skills on the team, /u/sunscreenpuppy, but we thought it'd be way more fun if the banner and snoo were created by the community! Because we've already seen that we have some pretty creative skincare addicts - [looking at you](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dhg9dm/misc_i_made_a_skincare_illustration_for_day_13_of/), /u/cornpopsforever!

We'd love to get your feedback on how to organise this contest, because we'd like to make something that works, that's fun for people to participate in and that's doable.

This is our general outline: first, a brainstorming thread where everyone is welcome to share ideas (whether they end up making a design or not) and where we'll include all the details. People are free to use ideas from the brainstorming thread or come up with their own. Then a feedback thread, where people who have started their designs can share them and get feedback (totally optional). Finally a voting thread - we haven't worked out what the best way is to do this yet. And of course we'll announce the winning designs and upload them to the sub!

What I'd love to know:

* What do you think about this general setup for a design contest?
* Is there anything we could do to make it better or more approachable?
* Do you have suggestions on how to do the voting in a fair way?

## **New item: User spotlight!**

We'd like to use this opportunity to celebrate some awesome users!

The first one is looong overdue. I created a form to nominate awesome users - and then promptly forgot all about it, until we re-did the sidebar organisation. Which means I completely missed that not just one, but TWO users had nominated /u/LikesGreenTea earlier this year!

/u/emsgoo and an anonymous user both took the time to fill out the form and tell the mod team how great /u/LikesGreenTea is:

>they are an avid skincareaddiction member and answer questions with good intellect on skincare. they answer so many questions and they are just AWESOME! 

> Every time I search the subreddit for a specific issue, I find a detailed thoughtful well written comment and 90% of the time it is LikesGreenTea.

/u/LikesGreenTea: thank you so much! We're giving you an Awesome User badge :) And thank you anonymous and /u/emsgoo for your nomination!

Secondly, we have two great Sunscreen Review posts that we've added to the wiki:

* [The 10 sunscreens I've tried in my HG search! In depth reviews + swatches](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dcern5/review_the_10_sunscreens_ive_tried_in_my_hg/) by u/Ivorykiki
* [11 Sunscreens for Sensitive Skin at Low Price Point (Mega Review + Photos!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/d5x4g0/11_sunscreens_for_sensitive_skin_at_low_price/) by u/caffeinatedlackey

We really appreciate the time and effort that went into creating these helpful posts! /u/Ivorykiki and /u/caffeinatedlackey, we'll give you a Content Contributor badge to say thank you :)

Do you see anyone being awesome in the sub? [Send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSkincareAddiction&subject=&message=) and nominate them for the next User Spotlight!

## **Off topic topic: spooky stories**

/u/scumteam14 loves ghost stories, and it's almost Halloween! So share your favourite spooky stories with her in the comments :)

If you're not into ghost stories but you are celebrating Halloween, I'd love to hear how you're going to celebrate it! Are you staying home in your PJs? Sitting on the porch to scare trick-or-treaters? Working in a haunted house? Let us know!

And to get back on topic: Do you have any questions for us mods? Suggestions for the next Fireside Chat thread? Let us know :)

18,"Does anyone else have experience with their hands feeling different after their routine?

After a few weeks of my routine, my hands feel weird. It’s like there’s a dry layer of something on them. There’s a part of my left hand that has started flaking off. I guess it’s my routine? I have to touch my face with my hands to put products on. After I’m done with my sheet mask, I pour the excess liquid into my hands and rub it into my neck, chest, and hands. When I’m done moisturizing, I put the same moisturizer on my hands.

My routine is:

Evening:
1. Kose Softmyo White Cleansing Oil (wiped off right before shower)
2. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser (in shower)
3. Stridex Maximum wipes (used every other day, sometimes every two days)
4. Kikkamasamune Sake Skin Lotion Moist
5. My Beauty Diary Black Pearl Mask
6. Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream

Morning:
1. Wash face with lukewarm water
2. Apply mineral sunscreen.",1571242276.0,[Skin Concern] Does your routine affect how soft your hands are?,0.78
11,"I have a few questions about my current routine that I was hoping y'all would be able to assist with/or share your experience on.  I'm currently working with a dermatologist on my skin, but I'm feeling a little disheartened by the process.  Here's a bit of background/info on my current routine:

**Routine:**

1. I wash face with SkinCeuticals Simply Clean Cleanser, which is *fine,* but I don't think I'll repurchase because it just seems ungodly expensive for something fairly ... simple.  
2. Sometimes use a sulfur face wash prescribed by my dermatologist (\~3 times a week).  I don't have the slightest clue if it does *anything.*
3. Use Tretinoin .05% (sometimes I'll moisturize before and after the Tretinoin)
4. Use a moisturizer, which has been La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 , which I love, but have a few issues with:
   1. I go through it so fucking fast, and it only comes in a tiny tube
   2. Sometimes it like cakes up in areas so that if I touch my face, some like peels off (maybe I'm using too much?)
   3. My dermatologist isn't convinced it's the best moisturizer because it's more of a balm -- she recommended La Roche Posay Lipikar Daily Repair Moisturizing Body Lotion, which I'm convinced breaks me out.  Also, it fucking STINGS when I put it on.  My dermatologist said some stinging is fine, but it just doesn't feel right (tried also, La Roche-Posay Effaclar H Compensating Moisturizer, which I'm not sure I like either)

**So, with all of that, here are my current issues:**

1. My skin chronically peels.  It's strange, because my skin doesn't feel dry, and when it does peel, it's not raw underneath --- it's almost like skin peeling on a old sunburn.  I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn't feel like liquid fire when applied (other than Cicaplast), and that doesn't leave me a peely mess by the end of the day.
2. I'm still struggling with breakouts.  They're like tiny little pimples too - nothing super big or anything, just a lot of little, little pimples.  They're driving me crazy!  I get that Tretinoin takes time, but I'm about 3 months in and I don't see any of that glowing, lovely, ageless skin.  I know it's a process and it doesn't happen over night, but I'm feeling kind of defeated that whenever it seems like for a day or so my skin is looking better, I get like three pimples the next day in the same spots over and over.

**Also, some other details (don't know if they're helpful):**

1. My dermatologist recommended the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic serum, which I unfortunately bought.  I used it for a bit and saw no real difference.  I mainly stopped because I cannot for the life of me get past the smell.  
2. I've tried Neutrogena Hydro Boost and it seemed OK, just not enough moisture, also, it was one of the moisturizers I've tried that burned like I had just tattooed my whole face.

2,"I am a 23F and have got mild-moderate acne. 

At any one time I usually have multiple small red spots. I also have recently (past 6m) have started getting larger spots deeper under the skin that take weeks to go. 

I have tried a range of products, and have used each for at least 6 weeks to see if they work: 
- Duac cream 
- Tea tree collection (Body shop) (Caused lots of clogging and more cystic acne) 
- Soap & water (very drying but no massive spots) 
- Micellar Water and Rinseing (no massive spots but no clear skin) 
- A large selection of acne cleansers etc from the shop

I recently tried using acnecide, as when I was 18 I used this and it successfully cleared my skin for a while. I used La Roche Posay Effaclar H moisturiser afterwards. 

I started using it Saturday, and I have developed lots of small red spots and tiny whiteheads around my chin and cheeks. On my cheek bone area, I have developed very red patches which are very rough/bumpy- these are not spots but the texture is visible and it is sore. 

I’ve since discontinued using, but my skin is in the worst state it has been this year and the new rough texture on my cheek bones is getting me down just as much as all the new spots. 

Does anyone have any tips on healing this rough skin? Or has this happened to anyone else?

26,"When choosing a moisturizer, the first question you need to ask is: What do I need specifically, an emollient or a humectant?

**Emollients** are used to soften and smooth the scales of the skin, which help reduce rough, flaky skin. Unlike humectants that attract moisture, emollients create a guarding film in order to trap it. Emollients are typically used to protect skin cells and help regulate skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and ichthyosis by preventing scaly patches, itchiness, and flare-ups.

**Humectants** typically draw water to the skin from two different places; they can draw water from a humid environment, and they enhance water absorption from the outer layer of the skin.

**+ Occlusives**: Occlusive ingredients create a physical barrier helping to trap moisture in the skin. Moisture can’t escape very well, nor can it penetrate this barrier. Other occlusive ingredients include wax, dimethicone (or any ingredient ending in “cone”). Occlusives work in tandem with humectants and emollients to help keep the skin hydrated, soft, and glowing by preventing trans-epidermal water loss (aka TEWL.) This is achieved due to an additional barrier against the skin that locks in moisture—but it doesn’t increase it.

If you have a **Dry skin** type and you consider yourself to be hydrated, you should focus on a good emollient to lock-in the moisture in your skin barrier and prevent patches, eczema or itchiness.

If you have **any skin type** but suffer from dehydration you would need the three of them present in your moisturizer.

Some good **humectants** to look out for in a moisturizer are Beta-glucan, Yeast Extract (one-of-the-best), Aloe, Honey, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Red algae, Allantoin.

Good **Emollients** include Lanolin(best, in my opinion), Squalane, Shea butter, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, any oils high in linoleic acids. I would refrain from using emollients such as Mineral oil, Petrolatum or Paraffin as they were reported to be **potentially** damaging to the skin in the long-term. It all depends on your skin reactiveness, some people love mineral oil, and some not. Pay attention to how your skin reacts to these ingredients. 

In terms of **occlusives,** most plant oils are considered emollients, but some oils, particularly those high in oleic acid, also have occlusive properties. Lecithin, and Cocoa Butter work wonders as occlusives. You can find Dimethicone as one of the preferred occlusives in most moisturizers, but some people with sensitive skin have reported reactions to it.

**A good moisturizer for water loss:** Biologique Recherche Hydravit's (excellent humectant quality and formula).

**A good moisturizer for dry skin:** Drunk Elephant Lala Retro (emollient-focused formula).

*****Disclaimer: The two products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a moisturizer and I thought I could share my experience because I have spent some serious money on products that simply didn’t do the job.*****

I have sensitive, combo skin in which my T zone gets oily part way through the day. I have been moderately acne prone since I was a teenager. Back then, I tried all kinds of harsh acne treatments, wore a ton of makeup, and went tanning. Over time, I stopped most of the acne products and quit tanning. I also (within the past year or so) stopped wearing makeup on my skin (only eye makeup). Although it is much better than it was, I do still have some mild skin issues I would like to straighten out.

I have some CCs, OCs, and sometimes get small pustules or papules. I also have uneven texture and some mild pigmentation from acne scars. Up until the past month or two, I generally just took my eye makeup off with micellar water and washed my face with just water (I had previously done OCM, but got lazy).

4,"Hello, SCA!

I would love your help. I read thing a lot but still think I need some help. I have pretty okay skin. I have a small patch of eczema every now and again but I’m overall happy with my skin with one exception: closed comedones and hyperpigmentation. 

I have PIH and use a pretty solid routine that has improved it! My closed comedones, however, remain unchanged. I feel them right under the surface of the skin on my forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw. If I look very close, I can see them. But they aren’t glaringly obvious. 

If I’m so inclined to clear a pore, a squiggly line of pus comes out or a thicker white pus (sorry, TMI). More often or not, they’re stuck and I don’t feel like picking anyway. I think these may also be sebaceous filaments. 

My routine is as follows:

AM:
- rinse face with warm water
- tone (Benton Aloe BHA toner)
- serum (TO alpha arbutin + HA)
- moisturize (Biossance squalane + omega repair cream)
- oil (Biossance vitamin c + rose oil)
- sunscreen (Skin & Lab Fre-Sun Lotion SPF 50+ PA++++)

PM:
- double cleanse (DHC deep cleansing oil)
- cleanse (Dr. Jart dermaclear micro gel cleanser)
- tone (Benton Aloe BHA toner)
- serum (TO alpha arbutin + HA)
- moisturize (Biossance squalane + omega repair cream)
- oil (Biossance vitamin c + rose oil)

I usually use a chemical exfoliant (nip and fab glycolic instant fix extreme 5% glycolic acid) 1-2x a week but I switched for using good genes lactic acid treatment for two days and my skin became very itchy and dry. I haven’t exfoliated since then. 

I feel like my routine could be better and I’m not sure where to make the improvement for my closed comedones. I want to start getting facials, but want can I do preventatively on my own?

I have dry skin other places and originally thought that was the problem, but my face is never flaky like my other skin is so maybe this is something different?

I have been experimenting with my routine but nothing seems to have much effect on the tightness. I tried heavier moisturizer and a sleeping masking but that had no noticeable effect.

2,"I have a habit of doing too little research and buying products that I don't test or give my face time to adapt to. Years ago when I first got into skin care, I decided that I have combination dry skin and bought Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and Cerave Facial Moisturizer. I pretty much only used those two twice a day, AM and PM, and my skin was... fine. Not great, not terrible. I wanted to fix my SF and I got blind pimples once every couple of weeks.

Recently, I decided to do something about it. I have Ponds Anti-Wrinkle Rejuveness Cream, so I started using that a couple of times a week (with sunscreen, of course). At the same time, I started wetshaving because I've been developing ingrown hairs and I needed a new razor anyway. That caused irritation and bumps, probably a combination of bad technique and bad reaction to the shaving soap. To combat that, I bought myself red box Stridex. Why? Because I decided that I actually have combination seasonal skin. So a cheap BHA like that would probably help balance my oil production and heal the razor bumps.

I've since stopped the AHA and switched to a soap that's better for sensitive skin. But now I have PIH and the razor bumps seem to be getting worse. I can't tell if they're healing or not. My routine recently:

AM:
No cleanser. I leave my house, hit the gym, shower, moisturize with Cerave Facial Moisturizer, then head to work. I do this because I don't want to cleanse/moisturize at home, work out, shower, and moisturize again. Or maybe I should do that? 

PM: 
Cerave Hydrating Cleanser
Stridex if I don't shave. If I shave, I use an alum block. 
Wait 25 min
Cerave Facial Moisturizer 

My hunch is to stop shaving and stick with a simple cleanse/moisturize daily until the razor bumps heal. And then after, I can address my PIH and SF concerns. Does that sound about right?

 [This photo was taken 30 mins after showering](https://imgur.com/a/oq8wtXW)

I have been on acne.org  for two years now and it kept my face acne free for 93% of the time. (I guess this is where I got my dehydration from, benzoyl peroxide)

I've been trying to fix my oily skin by cleansing using oily skin cleansers,  applying oils like rosehip, jojoba using a matte moisturizer and such throughout the years but it seems that my skin is a capital of oil production.

Recently I found out that I have dehydrated skin so I began trying to fix that as well. I added in Vita B5 Toner and Cerave Hydrating moisturizer to help restore my moisture barrier on top of my Acne.org Regimen. I started breaking out, and little bumps, especially near my jawline, started coming out of nowhere, I don't know what they are, but they seem like the can grow as an acne/pimple.

So I stopped using vita b5 toner because of the breakout, Went back to my normal routine, acne.org and it cleared it again but it took two weeks or so. 

Fast forward to last week, I swapped my moisturizer to Cerave Hydrating Moisturizer, it was good for 3 days then my breakout and bumps started coming back. 

 [This is my skin now, you can see the little bumps and the breakout.](https://imgur.com/a/qJzN4PA)

Benzoyl peroxide is amazing, It's the only thing that I have tried that has kept me acne clear. However, I don't know if this is 100% correct but it's probably what caused my dehydration. I don't want to stop using it because the moment I do, I start breaking out. When I break out it leaves PIH that stays for a couple of months. Nothing works for my oily skin either, I do use a Matte moisturizer on top of my regular moisturizer but that only lasts an hour or so before the oil penetrates through it. 

I don't know if I should just keep my skin dehydrated so I don't break out or not. 

At this point, I'm convinced that every time I apply hydrating products or whenever my skin is actually hydrated, I break out.

Kind of a complicated issue.

When I was 16-18 I had acne and self treated it like an idiot. I used way too much benzoyl peroxide and my face was really red and dry. Didn't use a moisturizer at all.

It was fully peeling and very stingy but I suckered through. It was like 6 months if messing up my skin with BP.

I then weaned off it and just did gentle cleansing.
I eventually incorporated cleansing and moisturizing, and have been consistent for 6 years.
However, my skin is still red and looks messed up.

I am wondering if the long period of excessive dryness and irritation depleted a vitamin or collagen or something in my skin.

Is that possible, and is there something that can help beyond having moisturized and used extra gentle products for 6 years?

I always had naturally really clear skin, didn't have to worry about it nearly at all. Then last December BOOM break out of closed comedones and clogged pores. Full panic mode.

The're around my chin, jawline, hairline and inner cheekbones and before anyone says, I'm super careful to remove ALL make-up.

I thought it might be over-exfoliation, so I cut down my routine to basics and gave it around 5 weeks and nothing changed, if anything I suddenly got white super-irritated white-heads.

I've been struggling with acne for three years now. After seeing a dermatologist last summer, I was on antibiotics and epiduo (adapalene 0.1%, benzoyl peroxide 2.5%): my skin got way better! But now that my treatment ended, my skin got worse and I got a lot of breakouts..

Since I couldn't go see another dermatologist, I've decided to give Dermatica (UK version of Curology) a try! I've been prescribed with adapalene, niacinamide & clindamycin. I'm supposed to receive my order this week but I'm really scared of purging as I heard that it's really common to happen especially when using adapalene.. Given the fact that having a few spots makes me feel so low, I can't imagine how low I'll feel when I'm going to be purging :(((

- Splash my face with water
- Klair Unscented toner
- Benton Aloe Propolis soothing gel

- after 20 minutes, Benton Aloe Propolis soothing gel

Logical thing for me was to get an SPF infused primer, since I wear makeup everyday and I felt like regular SPF would be too clogging.

I don't know if it's because I didn't understand how to take care of my face when i was younger and let it get worse, or I was just have genetics like that.

2,"Never done a product review before, so apologies if this isn't sufficient. But please feel free to ask questions...

So I've been on the lookout for a gel lotion for AM and PM use that can really help rebuild my moisture barrier on my cheeks due to increasing usage of retinol. Researched on this forum and on r/AsianBeauty, but all the products that I wanted to try aren't available in country (or via a legit source without costing an arm/leg on shipping). I purchased this out of impulse since I was really gearing towards a Japanese or Western product.

Atopalm is a Korean skincare brand that uses patented (or will be so?) MLE technology that supposedly mimics or help with your existing moisture barrier. I'm probably not explaining this right, so please do your googling to understand their brand better. Their Soothing Gel Lotion is  baby-friendly, and applicable on face and body. I'm not sure what the ingredients are since everything is in Korean. I read that to amplify the soothing effect, you can store this in the fridge as well. But this isn't a product that *needs* to be stored in a fridge.

**MY SKIN TYPE:** combo skin. Normal T-zone (though currently have and prone to SFs on nose and chin) and dry, sensitive cheeks. A couple of acne whenever hormonal cycle is approaching. Ancient acne blemishes, sun spots and a couple of old (now purple) broken capillaries on cheeks. No scars. Rosacea just under the nose.

**CURRENT SKINCARE ROUTINE:** (sorry, it's more elaborate than I would like as I am trying to finish a lot of products that I had purchased out of greed)

**Morning** \- wash face with water only > Inkey List BHA on nose and chin > Hada Labo Gokuyjun Hyaluronic Acid toner > Hada Labo Hydrating Essence on forehead and cheeks (I don't think it's  really doing anything to my skin, simply trying to use this up) > Sana Namerakahonpo Plumping Eye cream > The Ordinary's Squalane Oil on nose and chin > Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion > Anessa Perfect UV sunscreen mild milk

**Night** \- Shu Uemura Ultim8te cleansing oil, followed by Hada Labo Cleansing foam wash > *insert Pixi Glow Tonic once a week* \> Hada Labo Gokuyjun Hyaluronic Acid toner > Hada Labo Hydrating Essence on forehead and cheeks (I don't think it's  really doing anything to my skin, simply trying to use this up) > Sana Namerakahonpo Plumping Eye cream > *Insert The Ordinary's Retinol 0.5% in Squalane alternating nights and not using Pixi Glow Tonic* \> Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion *(mixed in with The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid on days without Pixi Glow Tonic and TO's retinol)*

**PRODUCT THOUGHTS:** Didn't have any high hopes, but was pleasantly surprised!

**Texture and finish -** like a lotion. Most of it sinks in quite quickly like a gel. I don't use a lot of it - I would say about a US 10 cent coin amount for night time. Day time, slightly less. It has a bit of a sticky finish at first, but my skin feels sufficiently hydrated and protected when it's fully absorbed. It goes under my sunscreen and liquid foundation nicely.

**Scent -** there's a faint pleasant smell. Not overwhelming at all and it goes away rather quickly. No medicinal smell or the kind you get when you buy fragrance-free skincare products. Presumably it has fragrance and/or essential oil in it, though again I cannot confirm as I don't speak Korean.

**How my skin feels after 3 days of usage -** it feels pretty resilient! I've used it as my last step for 1 retinol night routine and 1 Pixi Glow Tonic night routine, as well as with TO's Azelaic Acid mixed into it for another night. Also used it as a morning moisturiser. No breakouts or any clogged pores on areas that I applied (forehead and cheeks). I have started even applying it down my neck/decollete as well, and will be using it as my body moisturizer when I travel. I don't find it soothing in the obvious sense - say, if I was applying an aloe vera gel - but it also could be because I don't have severe damage on my skin and I haven't stored it in the fridge.

Before stumbling upon Atopalm, the most recent moisturizers I tried are:

\- Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Light Cream (pink tub) - nice basic hydrating cream. But my moisture barrier took longer to heal with this product than the Atopalm. It also was too heavy for my nose and chin and caused my pores to clogged up.

\- Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Water gel - did not feel hydrated whatsoever, or that my moisture barrier was improving. Very strong alcohol scent.

I find that  Atopalm is equally, if not more hydrating, than these products. But Atopalm definitely made my skin feel the strongest. I'm still in the process of keeping SFs under control on my nose and chin, but I will be applying Atopalm on those areas once they are.

If you are struggling to find a light moisturizer that you can use in the AM and PM, the ingredient list is acceptable, don't mind waiting more than a few minutes for the product to dry, or looking for a moisturizer for both face and body for travelling, I would highly recommend you give this a go :)

So heres some advice no one directly asked me for, but I hope it is helpful. I would also encourage others to share their skincare secrets on this post.

1) Stick to up to 3 products for day and up to 3 products for night time. 1 cleanser, 1 acid (if you are into that), 1 serum/ moisturizer. More than that and you will likely clog your pores. I add a tea tree mask when my skin is being fussy

2) Using products that are too harsh for your skin can cause / worsen inflammation / acne.  Sometimes your acne is your skin reacting to you shooting flame throwers (multiple acids) at it. Soothing products like aloe can offer some relief.

3) You are what you eat...and drink. No matter what any derm says, its been my experience that excess sugar and fat can reek havoc on the skin. When this happens to me, I do a soup fast along with only drinking plain water, lemon water, and tea (artificial sweetner) for at least a week. I slowly add foods back after my skin has cleared up. This allows me to identify the trigger food(s) and any commonalities among them. I never really ban anything, but I do limit the triggers.

4) Supplements: Some supplements detox your body and can express in your skin via bumps. Research any supplements/ vitamins that you are taking. If they are known for causing bumps, you may need to lower your dosage for a while OR up your water intake.

5) Try supplements that are purported to improve your skin. May require some trial and error. I'm currently playing around with a supplement that is quite expensive, but so far it actually works pretty well.

6) Exercise. It just makes your body function better. I focus more intensely on exercise during my fast because I am trying to rid myself of toxins and hormonal imbalances.

7) Tea Tree oil. Periodt. Its anti-fungal.

8) If all else fails, take the money youve been spending on cream after cream and try a GOOD dermatologists.",1571109359.0,[ACNE] UNSOLICITED ADVICE BASED ON RECENT POSTS. Hope this helps!,0.2

This has happened twice in my life.

I  had a random bout of acne that lasted MONTHS on my face (my cheeks and  jaw). It never happened before on those areas. It happened right after I  got my face threaded. I tried everything I normally used - AHAs, BHAs,  Vitamin C, masks, etc. Nothing worked. I went to a dermatologist, and  she prescribed me a topical antibiotic with some benzoyl peroxide - my  acne took about 1-2 months to clear up and not come back. Then I used my  regular AHAs to clear away the scars.

My skin was clear for a few more years... and then it happened again.

It  started breaking out on my chin and cheeks. I couldn't figure out how  to get rid of it. Sulfur ointment didn't work (thought it was fungal),  tried my usual BHAs, swapping out all my usual skincare to isolate the  problem, not using anything. I did this for half a year. Then I tried  using benzoyl peroxide, by itself (with moisturizer), for about 1-2  months, and it completely cleared my acne. The spots, the breakouts -  it's all stopped. I think the reason is that when you have a bacterial  infection on your face, it needs to be treated first.

Anyway  - if you're struggling, please give BP a try! Look up short-contact BP  to make it easier on your skin - basically apply a thin layer for 1 min,  rinse it off. I did this once a day for a week or two, then twice a day  for another few weeks, then started leaving the thin layer on during  the night.

Hello everyone,

I'm currently concerned about how much texture I got and specifically on my forehead.

&#x200B;

My skin is oily and acne-prone and I have been changing my skincare routine quite a lot these past weeks.

 I've used Accutane in the past (treatment for acne) for 9 months and stopped using taking it 1.5 years ago which worked wonderfully. Since then, my skin has gotten worse.

It's not like it's the worst, I don't get those big pimples, but I don't like how much texture I got and I'm afraid I over exfoliate my skin or just doing something wrong? Might be using too much products? Every ideas are appreciated.

&#x200B;

One issue currently is I do not use a sunscreen at the time, because I ordered Krave The Beet Shield, but it's taking a lot of time to arrive and I don't like using other sunscreens because my skin gets so oily (this might be the problem) :/

Nutrition is pretty on point,  I don't really eat any processed foods. But trying to eliminate dairy  for a month or more anyway to see if that helps. Kind of trying  everything with seriousness at this point. Thanks for taking the time to  read and share any advice!

10,"Hello, 

I am a skincare newbie. I have read the basics on the wiki but am unsure what products to buy for my skin (I am in the UK). 

I have combination skin, mostly oily but I have recently had a lot of dry patches (not sure why as I haven’t changed anything). I’ve got a horrible dry patch on my eyelid and a large dry patch on the tip of my nose. I have brown skin and suffer from hyperpigmentation. I also have sensitive skin - many products cause my skin to become itchy and red. On top of all of this I have rather large pores. 

I do not wear makeup (except mascara, lip stuff) and do not use/have never used moisturiser - every moisturiser or serum I have ever tried makes my face sweat *instantly* . The sweating will get worse if I go out with moisturiser on, ill have sweat droplets all over my face. It’s been like this forever but I understand that moisturiser is needed and I do not know how to find the middle ground.

I usually use a soap (probably bad I know) to wash my face - it’s called Dead Sea mud mask soap but today I have bought the simple moisturising face wash, so I’ll see how that goes. 

I occasionally use cold pressed hemp seed oil at night - if I remember to use it, I’m not sure if this does anything but it doesn’t make my face sweat so that’s a plus. I’ve tried Argan oil and rose hip oil in the past but did not like them. 

I do not suffer with acne/spots, though I do get a lot of spots under my chin around my time of the month (it’s badly scarred from me picking). 

I just want some recommendations for a simple affordable skincare routine which will hopefully help with the problems above (dry patches, oiliness, pores, products that won’t make me sweat, pigmentation). I also wonder if there any ingredients I should avoid? What is bad for my skin? 

I’m clueless and do not know where to start. I feel like there’s so much going on with my face and that there cant be anything out there that will cater to me.

6,"Over the years I've tried a bunch of different products and honestly, only a select few made visible and positive improvement to my skin. I guess I'm curious to learn what other products worked well for my fellow skincare addicts lol. Please note, I like products that work really fast! 


The most important change I made to my improve the health of my skin was eliminating diary as much as possible.  No milk or cheese, took care of my cystic acne problem completely.  But on to the products.  


Being someone who is acne prone,  BHA is critical for me and I've tried many that didn't do anything for my skin.  

The most effective product in this category is Paula's Choice 4% BHA. You will see results after the first use, clearer and smoother skin. I've never had a pimple it couldn't destroy after two usage.  It's like magic.  I recently used her 9% BHA and saw great results as well but it's more of a spot treatment.  


Another issue I encountered over the years is dullness.  Dark spots etc and I must say I've tried a few vitamin C products but I didn't see any amazing change until I started using Olehenriksen Truth Serum and C Rush Gel creme. My favourite routine is to layer Truth serum, then PC's 4% BHA and top it off with the C Rush Gel creme.  This combo is guaranteed to produce frighteningly clear and smooth face the following morning.  As a guy, I don't like using this combo too often as it makes my skin looks too smooth and flawless.   


The most challenging category to find a  product capable of visually improving your skin is definitely the moisturizer category. Honestly, they generally don't do anything for my skin. My skin type combination and I get oily quickly, like needing a blotting paper oily.  lol Getting a moisturizer capable of just giving me a normal look was a challenge.  

The most effective moisturizer in terms of making your skin look renewed, younger, and litreally change the texture of your skin is drunk elephant's Protini. In Toronto, this is litreally over $100 after taxes which means,   it's not a product I get to use as often as I would like (like I always go around trying alternatives and they're no good), but whenever I use it, it makes me look 5 years younger after a week or two of consistent use.  I've litreally had a 6'1 tall extremely beautiful young lady randomly approached me inside a club and told me I was ""beautiful"" because of this moisturizer, it just makes you look your best lol. Actually dated her for a little while lol 

Caveat,  it can cause some reaction like white heads, I feel like it's purging with those signal peptides. Use BHA and continue using because after awhile your skin stop reacting.  


Another category I've tried a bunch of products in is the cleanser category. I've used many drying cleansers that just strip my skin and made it tight.  The ordinary oil cleanser has been a revelation for me as it really cleans my face post gym etc but instead of my face feeling tight it's actually moisturized and soft.  Try an oil cleanser, this one is great tho.


Lastly I'd like to discuss Masks, the most effective for having clearer skin for me has been NIOD Myrrh clay. Whenever I want to just to give my skin a deep and immediate clean, I go for this one.  It takes ten years off lol

I'm trying to look for a thicker moisturizer for the colder winter months that is fungal acne safe, and good for combo/oily skin if possible. I've tried looking at lists but it just leaves me more confused. 

Skincare rn:

Morning/Evening: La Roche Posay Effaclar Salicylic Acid Medicated Gel Cleanser, Tatcha The Water Cream Moisturizer

1-2x/week - Nizoral Shampoo Mask 

Benzoyl Peroxide10% spot treatment as needed for pesky pimples/cysts",1571081087.0,[Product Question] Heavier moisturizers for fungal acne?,0.72
5,"In terms of active ingredients, such as all the AHA's, BHA, retinol etc, I wondered if there are particular product types that these work the best in? For example, I have a toner with salicylic acid, but does that ingredient work better in perhaps a face cream, or a face wash for example?

For reference, I am under 25, have combination (but more oily skin) which is relatively clear from spots, however I do have clogged pores/faint blackheads mainly on my nose but sparsely in other areas too. I also have quite large pores on my nose and cheeks.

My current routine is:
Face wash: Glossier milk jelly cleanser
Toner: I switch between La Roche Possay Effaclar Astringent toner, the Pixi rose tonic and Pixi retinol tonic 
Serum: Vichi Mineral 89 hyaluronic acid booster (in the day)
Moisturiser: day - Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream (SPF 30), night - Keihl's midnight recovery concentrate
Eye cream: Kiehl's creamy eye treatment avocado 

My aim is to hopefully make my pores smaller, clear the pores and maintain young looking skin for when I am older and hopefully reduce development of wrinkles/lines a little. 

I don't want to make my routine too complicated, I'd like to stick with cleansing, toning, serum and moisturiser, but I'm happy to add in extra serums and use them at different times.

If anyone has any knowledge about which products should have which ingredients, it would be very useful as I want to switch up my routine and make it as effective as possible.

I got a big bottle of Tend Skin to spritz on the area post wax/sugar if I do go through with it, but I'm still really scared. Not of the pain or anything, just that I'll be laid up with hot compresses on my groin when I should be doing fun Halloween stuff with my b/f.

4,"So I just ran out of cotton pads and had to do my morning skincare routine without cotton pads. No big deal, right? Wrong.

Let me explain how I use cotton pads. In the mornings I use Niacinamide and peptides. As I'm sure everyone knows, peptides have penetration issues. They have to penetrate to the living skin layers to be effective.

To make sure my peptides are penetrating, I make sure my skin is sufficiently exfoliated at all times. I use high concentration Tretinoin every other day, and a 30% Glycolic Acid peel once a month. I also wash my face in the morning with a foaming cleanser to make sure my skin is completely clean and bare.

In addition to these things, I like to apply my First Treatment Essence on a cotton pad. FTEs themselves are supposed to enhance penetration of the following products. The cotton pad adds just a touch of physical exfoliation immediately preceding peptide application. 

So currently I'm on a hunt for the best cotton pads on the market. I'm pretty picky, I need them to be big, at least 2 inches, thick, soft while still providing some texture/friction to exfoliate slightly.

I am going to a 3-day music festival where I will be camping in a tent with some friends. There will be limited access to running water. I have extremely acne-prone skin and have had acne since I was 11 (23, F), and I am still in the middle of treating a really bad breakout that started around March of this year. My skin type is oily and acne-prone. My current routine is as follows:

AM:

\-Wash face with Cetaphil oily skin cleanser

\-Differin moisturizer with SPF 30

\-BB cream on scars/zits

&#x200B;

PM:

\-Wash face with Cetaphil oily skin cleanser

\-Clindamycin  1% cream

\-Tretinoin 0.025% (dilute with moisturizer if skin is feeling extra sensitive/dry)

I saw a massive improvement with the BP, but my skin was still so much worse than it had been two years ago when I had basically no routine.

And then about six weeks ago I just ran out of energy and stopped using most of my products.

My current routine is something like this:

&#x200B;

AM: 

Wash with water

Skinoren 20% azelaic acid

Nivea Sun Sensitive SPF50

&#x200B;

PM:

Wash with water… or don’t wash at all, if I'm feeling particularly lazy.

&#x200B;

My skin is now looking better than it has for the past year. My acne is mostly hormonal, so I know there’s a limit to how much topical treatments will help, and I’m at peace with that. After a year of having at least 5-6 active cystic pimples on my face all month, I can deal with 2-4 small ones for a week around my period. It’s annoying, but I now know how much worse it can be!

I suspect that actually, my skin just doesn’t need all that much help. Not using a cleanser or moisturiser seems to be a good option for me when I’m not wearing makeup. 

Soooo… what I’d like to know is, is anyone else doing a sort of minimal or “caveman-lite” routine like this? What do you use for removing makeup and sunscreen? Would something like witch hazel or rosewater help? How do you treat spots? Do you use any masks or other treatments as irregular boosters, or just for fun?",1571044852.0,[routine help] Caveman lite / water-only washing,0.87
15,"My skin has been such a wreck lately, and for the life of me I cannot pinpoint why! It’s making me feel so helpless. I’m not sure if a post like this belongs here or if I’m using it properly, so I’ll be happy to remove it if it’s not allowed. I mostly just want to rant honestly.

So I used to have fairly bad hormonal acne a few years ago, mostly due to puberty and lack of a solid routine(aka moisturizer lol, thanks dad). After stumbling upon this sub, I got some Cerave products and TO products and I had clear skin! Hallelujah! I still got the hormonal breakouts on the chin once and a while, but I felt freaking good and so confident! 

Flash forward to this summer, I decided to dabble more into the asian beauty world, specifically sunscreen. I got the popular Biore Watery Essence and the Centella Safe Sun, but unfortunately the Centella ended up breaking me out (pretty sure I’m sensitive to niacinamide or something). I thought the Biore worked, but I highly suspect the high alcohol content could’ve triggered the fungal acne that was just waiting to crop up again (looking back, I’m pretty sure it was rather severe during my high school days). Add to that the humidity of summer, the stress from school starting, bad eating habits and boom, my face was breaking out and itchy. And it literally hasn’t let up since then (the itch is mostly gone though thank goodness!). 

I stopping everything and went back to the basics with my Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and the Clinique Dramatically Different Lotion, but then... it got worse! So I put back the Stridex, and it worked a little. This weekend I think all the spots were starting to clear up, but unfortunately I made the biggest noob mistake. I’d been putting a lot of actives on my face trying to just get rid of all the acne, but as we all know that’s never a good plan. I feel like my skin’s biting back lol, so here I am again with angry skin ready to burst with new breakouts. 

*sigh* I’ll definitely lay off the actives, but jeez I just want this whole acne period to end already, preferably soon since I have an interview on Wednesday🙏🙏 Wouldn’t it be so nice if our skin didn’t always decide to be a jerk the one day we desperately need it to chill?? Lol and as insecure as this sounds, it sucks having had bad skin for so long, then finally getting to clear up, only for the acne to return once again. I just feel like everyone’s staring (and it doesn’t help my family had commented on how bad my skin has been lately), and my confidence is at an all time low.

5," I have been using a Vitamin C serum for a week and have already been seeing an effect, but wanted to do a bit more research on it. I came across this article: [https://www.oumere.com/blogs/news/the-3-reasons-why-vitamin-c-serums-are-bad-for-your-skin](https://www.oumere.com/blogs/news/the-3-reasons-why-vitamin-c-serums-are-bad-for-your-skin) and it's making me panic. The writer seems to imply that our bodies have a finite amount of collagen etc and that using something like a Vitamin C serum to increase the renewal of our skin will actually age us faster, because our bodies will then stop producing collagen a lot faster. There's also a lot about something called the Fenton reaction and that Vitamin C is a 'pro-oxidant' that will react with other chemicals to oxidise on our skin and damage it, but to be honest, I didn't really understand a lot of that.

I also take a collagen supplement, along with using Vitamin C serum as my only 'active' (at the moment), but now I'm freaked out that I'm going to run out of collagen and my skin will age more rapidly and poorly as a result.

I always breakout from stress and PMS which has lead me to have little pimples, red marks from touching them and acne scars from before that I want to get rid of.

I’ve had severe closed comedones on my face (forehead, cheeks, and jawline) for a few months, so the doctor recently prescribed me with Finacea 15% gel. I started using it last week and I use it everyday during the morning and evening. I’m not the most knowledgeable about skincare, so was wondering if I could get advice about my routine and the order of using products.

For both morning and evening, this is my routine:
- Cleanse with Cetaphil 
- Apply Paula’s Choice 2% BHA
- Apply Finacea
- Apply moisturizer 
- Apply sunscreen (just for the morning)

I’m confused about the order and wait time between using the above products. Should I use the BHA before or after the Finacea? And when should I use the moisturizer? I’ve noticed that in the one week I’ve used Finacea that the skin around my mouth and nose is red and painful.

Are there any other products I can introduce in my current routine to help with the stubborn closed comedones? I’ve heard a lot about The Ordinary’s products and was wondering if I can use something from their line along with Finacea.

19,"Last I posted here I started to get into a nice routine to combat my eczema. Things have changed.

Last winter I developed Nummular Eczema. It started on my neck and face but it has now spread to my arms, feet and upper lip area. The worst being my hands. Thankfully it does not cover my entire face like it used to. 

It used to flare up for about a week but then go down for 2-3 weeks. It has been in constant flare up mode since July. Some days the redness goes away, but the dryness and flakes are still present. 

Using soaps (unscented or scented) on my hands trigger it, as well as shampoos, body washes, sunscreen, makeup, most lotions etc. I cut out all of these items and it went away almost completely. But I work with animals and i have to wash my hands frequently, I also feel really gross after not using soap and I don’t want to get sick or get other people or my animals sick.

I’ve run out of things to try and combat this. I’ve visited the dermatologist & a normal doctor and all they can give me is steroid creams for temporary use. It’s been mostly just a band-aid solution. I would love some advice from some other eczema sufferers here. I’d love to find someone else with Nummular eczema I could talk to.

Things I’ve tried...
- Vanicream (the only thing that semi helps dryness)
- Oatmeal soaks, oatmeal masks
- Coconut oil, Shea butter, olive oil
- Facial oil
- Sleeping in a ski mask (lol)
- Going vegan
- Taking fish oil and other vitamins
- Probiotics
- Moist wound dressings
- Eucerin (made me flare up), CeraVe (a bit better but still makes me flare up on occasion), Ponds (flare up) Aveeno
- Aloe Vera (worst flare up of all time)
- Apple cider vinegar
- Essential oils (flare up city!!)
- Drinking loads more water
- Vaseline or Aquaphor (flare up)
- Allergy meds

11,"I'm currently using Paula's Choice Skin Balancing Gel moisturizer which I honestly love because it's so lightweight, hydrating, not greasy, and I love the finish. Unfortunately because it's so siliconey I have noticed it doesn't work well with a lot of sunscreens, they tend to just sit on top and never absorb and I feel sticky and greasy all day. 

I'm trying to find a similar lightweight moisturizer I can use during the day without all the silicone (or at least less, so it plays nicer with layers on top).

8,"I am a caucasian male, 38. 

I developed melasma about 2 years ago and have spent lots of time and money treating it. It's much better but not totally gone. Hydroquinone + lasers + sun avoidance.

Friends tell me, ""Man it looks like you could use a little sun"". I've gone on 2 dates where 1 girl has asked me ""Do you get out into the sun?"", and another ""You look like you have the kind of skin that will tan easily."" She's right. I can go out in the sun for 1 hour and come back looking Peurto Rican. 

I hate how pale and sick my skin looks. I've always had a tan my whole life. I worked on cruise ships for years and used to lay out in the sun. I look much, much better with a bit of a tan.  On the other hand I'm terrified of aggravating my melasma again. My natural skin tone is weird. It's not pale, but it's not tan either. It tends to take on the light of wherever I am.

I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. Maybe it's better to have some melasma and a tan, than to look pale and have some mild melasma. I realize tanning ages you, but dudes...I'm 38 and single after being married for 8 years. When I'm 60, no one is going to want to sleep with me anyways. So I'll have some more wrinkles.

I've asked my dermatologists about this and of course they can only see you as a medical condition. They can't ethically tell you ""go get a tan"", even if in their heart they think I would look better with one.

Is anyone else in this position? Sometimes I think about going and tanning but absolutely smothering the melasma-prone areas of my skin with sunscreen. I started to use all that fancy skin-nerd stuff, Retin-A, niacinamide, vitamin-C serum. I suppose I have to stop all that stuff.

2,"Hello everyone!

So this past February, I had a change in my living situation and moved from one town to another.

Since I made the move, my skin has not been in its best condition to say the least.

Note:  I used to have pretty bad acne when I was younger - up until 21 when I started taking antibiotics.

Here's what has changed in my living situation:

1. I moved from a clean town (at least, no big pollution sources) to a town in which I live like 10 minutes from an oil refinery.
2. I had to move in with my grandmother to take care of her.  She is a HEAVY chain smoke and smokes in the house.  I work from home.. thus resulting in me being around second hand smoke all day everyday. 
3. She's also not the cleanest person in the world either.  (I'll clean the house spotless and give it two days, voila we're back to a mess).

Since I made the move, my skin has been in crap condition and it seemingly started when these factors had changed.  I now have more acne than I've had in years, my skin is EXTREMELY blotchy, red and now super dry in some areas, which was never an issue before I moved.

I've tried to weed out external factors such as diet, etc but I'll be honest.. my diet has always included dairy, gluten and I used to eat a lot of sugar.  However, I've since removed soda from my diet entirely, drink my fair share of water in a day, and I rarely consume sugar except for the occasional indulgence. 

Can these factors have an effect on the skin?  I'm going to be moving into my own place within the month so I'm sure I'll get my answer then but I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion to weigh in on or if anyone experienced similar.

1,"Hey SCA❤ I've learned so much from this sub and stayed silent for so long. Here goes my first post!


I'm a 27 yo female from Phoenix, AZ and I had perfect skin up to 21 yo :(. Around this time I started wearing a lot of makeup and didnt have a good understanding of skincare...like none at all lol. I didnt care, unfortunately. Atm as of this month I feel like I'm more dry due to the Obagi but im combo for sure. My tzone gets oily throughout the day.


Fast forward some years after the acne started and I'm dealing with cystic, hormonal acne now. Around the age of 24 i went to see a dermatologist and after spending less than 5 minutes in the office they prescribed something that was $400 after insurance...I didnt feel confident the items would help or that the derm even listened to my concerns...I went in for advice, not to have products thrown at me expecting to know what to do with them - it's been so long that idr what the doctor prescribed me. 


I found r/SkincareAddition and you guys opened my eyes to Paula's Choice. The basic BHA and AHA creams changed my skin so much but I wasn't able to really fight the hormonal stuff well so I'd go on for years trying out other products...spending more than the original $400 I didnt want to spend lol but it's been fun learning about my skin and the science behind everything. 


That being said, I still have so much to learn and want to see if you guys have any advice for what I currently so and how I can implement a new vitamin c and aha product from Tatcha. The Violet-C Serum and mask both sounded amazing and I did like the reviews I've read about the hydration and cell turnover it can help with. I felt this was gentle enough and would help with the Obagi products I'm currently using for the acne I have - which, HOLY COW the ClenziDerm line has really change my skin so much. I saw a difference in just one night.


Should I completely eliminate the CosRX BHA blackhead power liquid while I'm going through the Obagi ClenziDerm products to clear my acne up? It's making a huge difference so I dont plan on quitting the Obagi products. 


I use the Obagi products because I only use a Clenser at night for obvious drying issues that come with Arizona plus the amount of makeup I wear require a double cleanse...well its basically a triple cleanse with their toner, it feels. 


I tried to find all the pH levels and typically go from thinnest to thickest, except the last step in my PM routine. Where ever I apple the benzoyl peroxide tend to get dry fast and flake overnight. To combat this, I tap the DE b-hydra to add more hydration back into those areas. Is this smart or is there something better I might try instead?



Would it be okay to keep the CosRX BHA before the Tatcha violet-c serum or should I replace the CosRX for the Tatcha?

Tatcha Violet-C Brightening Serum 20% Vitamin-C and 10% AHA: pH 4.5-5



Here's my current routine:

AM

	• Evian facial mist: pH 7.2

	• Secret key Starting treatment essence rose edition: pH 5-6?

	• CosRX BHA: pH 4.0

	• Tatcha Water Cream: pH ??

	• Tatcha Water Cream: pH ??

	• Bragi ClenziDerm Benzoyl Peroxide 5%: pH ??

	• DE B-hydra: pH 5.7


As a somewhat unrelated note, I plan to get on the Obagi Nu-Derm line but only the Step 3 and 5 (Clear and Blender).  Also, not for another 3 months at the minimum because of how much this will cost.

2,"Hey guys so for the past few years I every so often get a single bump on my scalp that itches and is painful.  There's usually just one in one section at a time but there may be multiple ones in different areas at one time.  They feel similar to a bruise and the pain radiates outwards from the spot.  Touching it makes it feel worse and sometimes I don't even notice it till I touch my scalp.

My scalp also gets smelly and oily after only about 10 hours of not washing my hair.  I try to wash my hair once every two days.  I feel like the oil and smell could be related but I'm not sure how to address these issues because I wash my hair as frequently as I want to without drying it out.  Maybe a pH issue?

I've been diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis but I don't think this is related.  Or maybe it is.  For the seb derm, I'm currently using 2% ketoconazole and it helps but it's also very drying on my scalp.

Some pics of the itchy bump are attached.  Anyone have any idea what this is?

The products I currently use on my hair are:

2% prescription ketoconazole

Free and Clear Shampoo

Nature's Zero Matte Clay to style

I sometimes use:  
T-Gel Extra Strength Shampoo

T-Sal Shampoo

I usually wash my hair once with the free and clear and then once with the ketoconazole shampoo, every two days.  I no longer use conditioner because I thought it could be making my scalp greasy.  I feel like I'm doing better without it actually.

- wash with vanicream gentle cleanser
- apply cosrx honey ceramide full moisture cream
- apply supergoop unseen sunscreen

- use off-brand target sensitive skin makeup wipes (if needed)
- wash with vanicream gentle cleanser
- apply cosrx honey ceramide full moisture cream
- apply differin
- apply a bit more cosrx honey ceramide full moisture cream

I just discovered this sub, so I wanted to ask a question.

Years ago, about maybe 6 or 7, Vichy used to sell a cream that I don't know what kind of black magic had in the composition, but after applying it immediately brightened my face, removed every single line imperfection, and killed all the oil from my face. 

I have a super mega oily head, I mean to the point that 4 or 5 hours after waking up, I can pass a kleenex on my bald head and ends like the simpsons oily paper episode.

7,"Hi! Long time lurker. I need your help, bad. I’ll try anything at this point. A couple weeks ago...my face started flushing red. It’s very ugly, and blotchy. And it happened at work...so that did wonders for my self esteem. Since then, it’s been happening almost every day whether I’m at work or not. Always around the same time. It’s a really warm and tingly sensation, like I’m having an allergic reaction. I’ve seen a dermatologist and she told me that it’s rosacea. I hadn’t changed anything in my diet or skincare routine when this started. I haven’t done anything out of the ordinary in the time leading up to this. I’ve noticed it also happens when I drink alcohol, even when it’s just one drink. But it was never this bad, and always just on my neck...not ever my face. It’s possibly that my awareness of it and stress are making it worse...and anxiety is another thing I’m trying to get a handle on. My dermatologist prescribed me Spironolactone and Minocycline to take orally, along with 2 topicals but so far, they haven’t done anything. If they do help, I figured they won’t start working for a few weeks/months but I don’t have high hopes. Here’s my skincare routine:

MORNING: Rinse with water, apply the Mirvaso that my derm prescribed me, and then moisturize with Neutrogena Hydroboost. 

NIGHT: Wash with CeraVe hydrating cleanser, apply the Metronidazole gel my derm prescribed me, and then moisturize with Hydroboost. 

My skin type is dry and...pimply, I guess. I’m sure I’m doing something wrong, or plenty of things wrong so feel free to give me ANY advice. I’m feeling so hopeless. I’m so sorry for this information dump, I’m just so desperate. I don’t wanna go out, or even go to work because of this. I’ll include a picture, it’s not great cause I snapped it real quick. That’s not even the full fledged flare up...it gets much more red and covers my forehead as well. I’m in Ohio, if that helps. I just wanna know if anybody has had similar experiences and if you’ve found a solution. Thank you soooo much to anybody still reading!

I started doing a bare minimum skin care routine (oil cleanser, foam cleanser, toner and then light moisturizer) a little bit ago and liked the change in my skin. With winter coming up, I decided to add a serum to my routine to make sure I stay properly moisturized.  

I used a serum a friend recommended that contained vitamin c, a retinoid and hyaluronic acid. I've used products like this before and had no issues or reactions.

About 5 days into using this product it started to BURN. Not a tingle, but it felt like my face are on fire. I was crying from the pain. I removed what I could from my face but my under eye areas were swollen and beet red. Its been over 24 hours and both of my under eyes are still pink and still sting (though they are better than before?)

The skin in a couple areas seems almost burned in texture too.

Question regarding Home IPL and Facial Bleaching while following a skincare routine

Hi I was wondering where in my current skincare routine can I fit in home ipl and facial bleaching. 

For the last couple of years I have been using the lumea precision plus on my legs, underarms and bikini line with great success. I am Indian with dark hair, oily skin which is dry when I wash it but gets oily after an hour or so and  I have acne, acne scars and marks, uneven skin, just really bad skin. The acne has reduced greatly but I still have scars and huge pores. I also have a decent amount of dark facial hair which in the past I have used facial bleach FEM to lighten. To help the issue my current routine is 

AM
1. Wash face with cerave foaming facial cleanser

2. Cerave AM moisturizer

PM
1. Remove makeup with whatever I have on hand which has ranged from Nivea double effect to micelles cleaning gel wash to Banila Co Clean it zero, basically anything to take the makeup off

2. Cerave foaming facial cleanser

3. Sometimes I’ll use a toner as step three but not always

4. Few months ago I started using TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% every single evening and it’s helped heaps! Two weeks ago I bought TO Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% and I alternate the two as my last step. 

I don’t moisturize after as I’ve noticed my skin doesn’t feel tight after using either one of the TO products and after a couple of hours it gets oily. 

Seeing how I’m using acids where in my routine can I fit in facial bleaching and IPL? Would not using the TO products for two days on either side of facial bleaching be ok? Also how long a gap if I were to not use facial bleach and only use IPL?

First picture is from this morning under natural lighting, second picture was last night right after washing and moisturizing under indoor lighting.

Hello! This is my first post and if I messed up on any rules, let me know and I’ll be happy to fix it. I have a few questions near the end (I’ve bonded the entire paragraph), if you don’t feel like reading all this.


After my severe acne finally went away, I was left with red marks that never seemed to fade. I couldn’t figure out what it was and gave up looking for a way to get rid of it because the only answers I could find were that it would go away with time. I started looking into skin care again 2 years ago and have since stuck to a (basic) routine to at least keep my face clean while still looking for a way to get rid of the leftover red marks. 

I learned about Vbeam vascular laser treatment and how it can get rid of redness. I went to a derm and found out the reason my redness wasn’t fading, even after years of waiting, was because I had postinflammatory erythema (PIE). I had a test session in May 2017 where only a few spots were treated. Within a couple weeks, those same spots lost their redness and were the same color as my normal skin. 

I had my second treatment (first full treatment) in September 2017, where every red spot on my cheeks were treated. Again, I saw some improvement in about 1 month post treatment. My next appointment wasn’t until a year later, around October 2018. I don’t remember the energy settings from that appointment but they were slightly stronger than my first full treatment. During my second treatment, my derm used the double stacking to see if it would increase improvement. I had every red spot on my cheeks zapped twice. The healing did take a little longer and the swelling was much worse this time. I had a bunch of whiteheads appear within a couple days that covered almost the entire treated areas. It took about 2 weeks for the swelling to go away. I did notice there was much more improvement after this session.

My most recent appointment was 8 days ago and there was no change in energy settings from my appointment last year and I only had a single pass over my red spots. So far, I haven’t noticed any improvement and I actually had 2 pustules pop up within a few days post treatment. In the pictures, they are the more inflamed red spots, one near the top of my cheek, about eye level and one to the right out that and a little lower. The one that’s more inflamed popped prematurely while I was washing my face and the other one was already near the end of its lifespan when it broke while I was washing my face. I’ll be getting a double stack treatment at my next appointment. 

I’m not sure if it’s all that obvious from the pictures but the texture of my skin is very smooth. Running a finger over my cheeks, the red spots feel just the same as any other spot on my face without any. There aren’t any indentations and my skin there is also flat. 

I’ve been hesitant about adding any new products to my routine while undergoing treatment. I don’t want new pustules or acne to appear right before an appointment so I want to wait until after at least 2 or 3 more appointments before I decide. 

Has anyone else gone through multiple treatments of vbeam and had their PIE completely removed? I’m curious about how many treatments it took for you. It’s $350 per session for me so I’m hoping it won’t take another 5 sessions before I don’t need to go anymore. Also, I believe I just have PIE now but if any other issues I might have with my skin, I would love to hear. If anyone has also gotten results for PIE with other products, I’d love to hear that too.

And if anyone’s interested, here’s my super basic routine. I don’t really use anything like BHAs, niacinamide, vit c, retinoids, etc right now. I’m mostly focusing on just keeping my skin clean while waiting for my vbeam treatments. I do the same thing for both morning and night.

- Wash face with Neutrogen hydro boost hydrating gel cleanser
- Exfoliate with Neutrogena exfoliating cleanser every 4th day
- Moisturize with Neutrogena hydro boost water gel
- If I’m going outside, I put on Neutrogena hydro boost water gel lotion spf 50

I found that neutrogena’s hydro boost products don’t irritate my skin at all and don’t clog up my pores that much. The gel cream moisturizer is thicker than the water gel so I use water gel in the summer and gel cream in the winter. I think I have combo oily/dry skin type because my forehead can get really oily throughout the day but my cheeks and chin will get dry if I don’t moisturize enough. 

Hoping to hear some feedback from this great community

6,"TLDR: I’m unhappy with my fairly large purchase from Frank Body. I’m curious if it’s just me/if I’m crazy, and what is the skincare community’s general consensus on Frank Body? 

[Pictured here! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/MvCf0HQ) — everything but the lip tints. 

A few months ago I discovered that Frank Body offers payments via Afterpay. I thought that was really cool because I had been following their Instagram for a while now but hesitating on making a purchase and afterpay works great with my pay schedule. 

I bought: Anti Makeup Cleansing Oil, Send Nudes Lip Tint and Cherry Bomb Lip Tint, Express-o Body Scrub, Body Balm, Shimmer Lip Scrub, as well as the regular/best selling Coffee Scrub. All of this equalled [almost $100.](https://i.imgur.com/kvTPtUE.png)

I spent a lot of money on products I thought were fine tuned, marketed well, and “natural” but I haven’t been impressed with any of these products enough to repurchase or recommend. 

The makeup cleansing oil is kinda slippery and slimy and doesn’t fully removed eye makeup, the lip tints are VERY sticky with almost no pigment. 

The express-o body scrub is extremely gritty and smells weird, the shimmer lip scrub is an extremely small pot of scrub with “shimmer” but I still don’t understand the  selling point because yeah, it shimmers when the scrub is on your lips but there isn’t anything shimmery after rinsing. 

The body balm is suuuuper oily and turns to a slimy liquid since it’s coconut oil based and last but not least, the best selling Coffee Scrub is *fine, I guess* but there isn’t anything super special about it and i don’t really notice a whole lot of improvement to my skin. I’ve made body scrubs in the past for personal use and gifts and it (frankbody) just seems like a very simple formula. 

I also didn’t realize that while there are different scrubs advertised on their site, you could pick one and just stick with it for a body scrub/light face exfoliator/AND a lip scrub. Buying all three I realize now, was kind of silly. 

I guess I just came here to see if anyone else has experienced disappointment with these very overpriced products?

So I just had my first facial in YEARS. Probably at least 10 years, since I used to get those teen facials at the dermatologist which mostly just consisted of extremely painful extractions.

Since I've started following this community over the past few years I've gotten really into skincare, and I feel like I have a great routine that works well for me. That being said, I am still dealing with a lot of congestion on my cheeks and chin, even though they very rarely turn into actual acne I still wanted to get a facial and see if the esthetician could help me out.

Overall, I felt that the facial was excellent. The esthetician did some kind of ultrasound treatment, which I wasn't familiar with previously but which heats the skin and does something to loosen debris/dirt?  She then did a lot of extractions, and it felt like she was actually scraping away oil/dirt with some kind of tool as well. Finally she used some serums and creams and it was just lovely.

What I need help with is her advice going forward. She told me that I am using too many strong actives (which I admit, she is probably right) and recommended that I stop washing twice daily and take a break from all of the actives I am using. She said I should rinse with water in the morning, use SPF, cleanse in the evening, and use a moisturizer and that's it. Her reasoning was that I had a lot of ""topical oil"" and that my pores were more ""open"" than they should be, which she attributed to my aggressive use of exfoliants, vitamin C, and retinoid. However, she also said that I need a stronger cleanser to address the topical oil. She said that although my skin is fairly clear, as in I do not really break out, over time I will start to break out and develop acne if I continue my current routine. 

Her logic makes sense, but I am confused about the ""topical oil"" and ""open pores"" comments. I was under the impression that the open/closed pores thing is a myth? In which case, what might she have meant? And what in the world is topical oil?? Also, should I really quit everything at once, or just reduce frequency? And I could use some recommendations for cleansers that might be more effective for me.

8,"As mentioned in the title, I’ve recently changed my routine up quite a bit. Current routine has been in place for a month. Details on my skin and my routine (current and what I was using before) at the bottom of the post. I was determined to wean myself off benzoyl peroxide, because it kept my skin clear but was drying my skin out so bad. Even contact therapy or 1-2x per week usage was undoing all of my progress on protecting my barrier. I found that niacinamide did a great job of helping so I’ve loaded up on it in my routine and I haven’t had any new breakouts.  


During this trial and error time, I also discovered that retinol/retinoids are not a consideration right now. I have no doubts that it may help with my goals but I’m very sensitive to the retinization process and I’d prefer to wait until warmer weather (I live in a state that sees four very distinct seasons and we are about to go into very cold, very dry weather) to mix things up again. I used prescription tretinoin cream for many years in my 20s  but it was a 6+ month process to see improvement. The process was brutal and exhausting anytime the weather changed. Even OTC/mild formulas wreck me before eliciting positive change.  


My issue is this — nearly everyday I wake up with 1-2 more dark spots around my cheeks, forehead and nose. They look like blurred freckles, and vary in color from slightly darker than my skin tone to deep brown. They’re spread in a uniform pattern across my nose onto my cheeks, and between my brows. They are flat and not raised. Meanwhile, the hyperpigmentation leftover from years of acne and compulsive picking seems to be fading. Whyyyyy?  


I am a salesperson and spend most of my day driving, then indoors visiting my customers. Is the “windshield time” the culprit? I wear large sunglasses and try to be mindful of the sun’s position so I can pull down the visor and keep the sun off my face as much as possible. I apply sunscreen in the morning and reapply during the day, and my foundation contains SPF as well.  


Sorry for the long post. I’m looking for any advice or recommendations. Anyone else spend a lot of time driving and have issues? Is it possible that this is old damage coming to the surface or is there something I’m doing wrong that is causing new damage?

29/f/dry skin mildly sensitive, and and aging prevention. Tryna look young foreverrr and account for the 8 years I worked as a farmer under the hot sun.

Routine: tbh I often wing it. It Bujo so I track skincare stuff and try not to overuse any particular ingredient too many days in a row, except niacimode and retinol which I try to use once a day (same for moisturizer and sunscreen lol)

Morning

+wash with REN purity cleansing balm 
(or just rinse with water and wipe with microfiber cloth). 

Love this stuff, smells nice, gets the gunk off, doesnt irritate or dey my skin

+TO glycolic acid 7% 

leaves my skin soft non irritating 

OR

+TO acerbic acid 8% plus alpha arbitron

I love vit C but this stuff is annoying cuz it oxidizes sooo easily and leaves a yellow tone on my skin unless I dont wear moisturizer or sunscreen over it, or leave like 20 min between applying the vit C and the rest of my routine, which I never have time to do. Just got ethylated acerbic acid 15% but havent tried yet-- supposed to be harder to oxidize this so well see if it looks a little better!

OR

+TO Resveratrol 3% Ferulic Acid 3%

Tbh idk what this does but I put it on to feel like I'm being good when I'm taking a break from the Vit C or AHA. I also layer it with the Vit C and AHA sometimes. Skincare jazz 😎

+TO Niacimide

Def feel like this helps my skin look clearer, and I feel like I dont need BHA as much with this.

+CeraVe in a tub

tried to avoid it cuz I dont trust the production process of silicons to keep contaminants out of the final product (a EWG study shows 25% of petroleum derived products contain carcinogenic contaminants from the refining processes), but dang this stuff keeps my dry ass skin moist most the day, and I cant argue with that. Plus the price.

+C'est Moi gentle mineral sunscreen lotion

Got this cuz it was on a list of nontoxic sunscreens put out by the EWG and also on a magazine list of physical  subscreen that doesnt look too bad. I am warm toned and it does make me look a little.. corpse? But not too bad. I like a greasy sunscreen cuz I'm a dry faced baby and this is nice and moisturizing to me. Would love to find a good tinted moisturizer replacement but havemt found one yet. Recs welcome!

Evening:

+wash with ren purity cleansing balm (or shower and tbh in the shower I dont wash my face because I feel like the shampoo that naturally gets everywhere strips everything off. Maybe I'm a heathen)

+TO Azelaic Acid 10%

Just got this, so far non irritating. Copped cuz curology included it in my now canceled subscription and I'm all about brightening my skin

OR

+TO alpha lipolic

Also just starting this, so far non irritating, have been very conservative. Supposed to be anti aging improve discoloration and plumpness, could always do with that!

+TO granactic retinoid 5% in squaline

We all know what retinols are supposed to do. Tret in Curology was crazy drying for me so I backed off to TO 2% granactive retinoid (the creamy one) and just upped to the 5% this month. Only complaint is that it doesnt sit well under my CeraVe in a tub, probably because it's in an oil ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

+TO natural moisturizing factors +HA. 

Just switched to this and love the reformulation. Old formula felt really dry to me, love that this is a bit milkier. Mixing with oil for bonus occlusion.


+Oil of some sort.. now its TO cold pressed chia, before it was cold pressed hemp from Amazon, or TO B oil

Gotta hold that moisture in over night!

I sometimes use BHA but I ran out and TO is out of stock and I'm a broke college kid so I'm waiting till they restock instead of going with the 5x as expensive Paula's Choice option (tho Paulas choice is amazing and seems like it is better formatted with more active ingredient but less irritating to my skin than TO... but TO is sooo cheap and works great as long as I resist the urge to put ALL THE THINGS on my face. )

I have been on tretinoin cream for 5 years and doxycycline (25mg per day) for 2 years and in combination with getting older, has reduced 90% of my acne. Unfortunately, my skin has now become discoloured and with large dots/pores on my face and dents that are noticeable in certain lighting.

1. What are the the dots? Large pores? I did not have this prior to having bad acne. Can they be reduced to normal?

2. Can my skin be returned to a normal “soft” state? 

3. What sort of work would likely be needed to be done? I am up for anything that isn’t heavy plastic surgery. I am aware I will likely need fillers for the dents from cysts.

5,"I didn’t start getting acne until about 20. I’m 24 now and I feel like I’ve tried everything and it hasn’t budged. I have been on Tretinoin (0.1% cream) for a couple months now and I notice a general improvement in the tone and texture of my skin, but I need some advice. My skin is still pretty sensitive, but it no longer gets red and irritated from applying. BUT even though I have faith in tretinoin as a holy grail product, I am still having a lot of issues and I’m not sure what to do or how to deal with them since I’m scared to use extra active ingredients (ex. AHAs) and risk irritation/inflammation and triggering ANOTHER breakout. 

1. My skin has become VERY oily and nothing I try works to regulate/reduce oil production

2. Instead of shedding off, the dead skin seems to just sit on my face and pile up if I don’t manually exfoliate, which I hate doing because it irritates my skin (even though I am very gentle and use a baby washcloth)

3. There hasn’t really been an improvement in my previous breakouts and it seems like I keep getting new ones on top of it (even if the new breakouts are just purging, I can’t get rid of some of the old, stubborn clusters!)

TLDR; How can I reduce oil production, keep up with the exfoliation of dead skin from the tretinoin, and more effectively treat acne without worrying about a bad reaction with the tretinoin? Is it even possible? If anyone has any tips or product recommendations, I’d really appreciate it. I’m at my wit’s end. 😔

Those of us who sometimes have issues with getting out of bed, nevermind looking down a skincare regimen on some days .. it is easy to get overwhelmed.. and then “fall off the wagon”.. and that just adds to the depression and anxiety and feelings over crap.

Over the years here are some little tricks I’ve learned, and I wanted to share with you. On the days where feeding myself was a daunting task.. it made me feel like I didn’t slip backwards with my skin, or maybe feel a little better.. without having to get out of bed.

1) keeping a basket of microfiber clothes (or disposable “dry cleansing wipes” (ultra soft medical grade, box of 500 wrapped 50 a piece for under 10 dollars on amazon) in my nightstand with a bottle of Micellar water.  

I also keep a jar of Cerave, and my tretinion in this basket.

At my very worst depression days .. I can get by three days.. with out doing too bad to my skin.

Usually a good oil cleanse before I eventually shower will get any shallow plugs from this. 

2) you don’t have to even use anything more than just micellar .. keeping it next to your bed, is good for those nights you just go to bed, and realize you forgot to take off your makeup, but there is no way you are making it to the bathroom

3) giving your over all body a wipe down actually will make you feel better

4) consider a spritz bottle with essential oil you enjoy.. citrus can be energetic, lavender relaxing.. whatever you like .. spray it on your hands, hair and bed linens .. 

5) remember we aren’t all perfect.. the tiny small things make a difference .. it’s hard out there.. and we need to be kinder to ourselves 

Now you can replace micellar water with Ceraphil or any other cleanser that doesn’t need water.  I hope someone finds this helpful!

After 3,4 months it improved my skin a lot, but after that it all went downhill.
The biggest side effect that I can't seem to find in any official documentation is unexplainable oilyness. The oil is sitting on top of my skin. Many would say it'a because of oil compensation (dehydrated skin), but I think that's a myth. I think the real reason why people have the *glow* is because the oil that was behind that stratum corneum layer is now revealed since the stratum corneum is thinned and doesn't cover up that oil. And that's why many people struggle with *oily* skin while on tret. The same amount of oil is now revealed. No matter how I build up usage, or moisturize, the ending effects are always the same.

6 months later, I've tried everything, from Fusicort to using a milk cleanser/moisturizer everyday. However, it still shows as bright red and sometimes is very clearly visible.

1,"Reposting to amend title to include tag, as per the rules.

EDIT TO UPDATE: well for all the panic below which you can now ignore, I was gently massaging my face in the shower with my fingertips, and the skin was sloughing happily. Bit dryer than normal now, but otherwise peachy keen and dewy, which is altogether very strange, but I'm not complaining - arguably it is in better condition than normal.

Used TO's AHA/BHA mask two days ago for the first time in a few months. It didn't tingle anymore than I recall. I removed it after 7 minutes rather than the full ten because I'm slightly impatient, and followed it with a squalane oil cleanse which I also haven't done in a few months. My skin is usually rather rugged, and I haven't had problems doing an oil cleanse after that exfoliation in the past. Guess I'll be more cautious next time haha.


Rinsed well after it all, and patted dry. At that point it all felt great, but when I applied my usual hyuralonic lotion that stung a lot, as did snail mucin and Cerave (in the tub). None of these things sting me ordinarily.


Initially it looked as if there were blister-like whiter regions over some pores on my cheeks, the sides of my chin, and parts of my forehead and some redness. It looked and felt not unlike I'd run headlong into a clump of nettles. It woke me a few times in the night however. By morning the blisters had mostly flattened out though the redness was more intense, but now those areas were extremely dry and raised, and as they lacked stretchiness, were getting tugged by facial expressions.


Gave the snail mucin another shot, and it was no longer causing stinging, but the affected skin and surrounding areas were mopping it up like crazy, whereas it usually takes an age for my skin to absorb far lesser amounts. That said, I found I could somewhat resurrect the layers of snail mucin by dampening my face with cool water, then adding a light moisturiser.


It is somewhat less angry looking today and quite a lot less uncomfortable, but to my fingers it still feels like fine sand that got stuck to damp skin and then dried in that very persistent coating before it could be brushed off.
Does anyone have any useful tips for addressing this, besides keeping at it with the snail mucin? On the plus side, the skin in between the bad bits seems to now be super-bouncy! Mostly thinking about potential for scarring, and ways to attenuate that as much as possible.

5,"After comparing a multitude of products, specifically ones from Sephora, I’m curious to know why brands from western companies cost a substantial amount more than products curated in Asia? When it comes to active ingredients such as retinols, acid peels, and such, I would get the higher price mark as Western Formulations are typically superior in comparison to Asian formulations. What I’m curious about is the formulations with claims for hydration, redness, sensitivity, and etc. Here an example.

The ingredients are typically aren’t superb. For example, the Fresh Black Tea Kombucha Facial Treatment Essence (250ml) is $68USD and this is the ingredient list: Water, Saccharomyces Ferment Filtrate, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Pentylene Glycol, Polyglycerin-3, Kigelia Africana Fruit Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Adenosine, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopherol, Butylene Glycol, Diglycerin, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Parfum (Fragrance), Disodium EDTA, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Citrate, BHT, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Biotin, Phenoxyethanol, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol. 
 
In comparison to an Asian Essence with similar claims/ingredients (though the concentration and overall ingredient list is superior)-ATRUE Real Black Tea True Active Essence 180ml for $42USD. The ingredients are: Saccharomyces/Xylinum/Black Tea Ferment(146,340mg), Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycereth-26, Niacinamide, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Dipropylene Glycol, Trehalose, Panthenol, Glycerin, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Maltodextrin, Propanediol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Sorghum Bicolor Stalk Juice, Adenosine, Tromethamine, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Disodium EDTA, PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Water, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Fragrance

Is this price discrepancy due to marketing?

* [Banila Co. Clean It Zero](https://www.amazon.com/BANILA-CO-Clean-Cleansing-Original/dp/B07BSV1T35) \- Oil Cleansing Balm - Double Cleansing has been a game changer for me. Currently use Erborian and I love the slightly medicinal plant smell. I am excited to try this out as I have heard such good things! I thought adding oil to my already oily skin would be counter-intuitive but it gets so much off my face it's crazy! I put it on my face, turn on the TV, and just massage my face very gently with my fingers in circles... after about 2 mins or so, I can feel tiny little sandy-gritty stuff start to appear under my fingers. I keep going for another few mins, very relaxing, very satisfying. And then I wash with tepid water, and then continue on with a gentle foamy cleanser (I currently use Cerave Foaming) **$4.99**
* [Neogen Gauze Peeling Lemon](https://www.amazon.com/Neogen-Bio-Peel-Gauze-Peeling-Lemon/dp/B019RULW50/) \- Toner - I've used these before and was happy to find then at TJ Maxx! I like the rounds more than the serum/toner they are soaked in. I am really careful to go nowhere near my eyes with this as it burns my skin. I have seen my post acne scars lighten with this product. I used to use it on a weekly basis (every Sunday is my spa day!) **$5.99**
* [Murad Multi-Vitamin Infusion Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Murad-Multi-Vitamin-Infusion-Oil-Revolutionary/dp/B0035I768S/) \- Face Oil - Woohoo! I just got out of the spot test phase and I honestly love this rich oil. I put it on 20 mins before bed so it can really sink in. **$9.99**
* [Holika Holika 99% Aloe Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Holika-Aloe-99-Soothing-Ounce/dp/B00K3KYTLI/) \- Gel/Moisturizer - I have never used this I have heard good things about it. If it doesn't work for my skin I will use it in my hair. (I have curly hair and I use aloe gel in my hair styling routine at the moment) **$5.99**
* [Cleansing Story Yellow Earth Deep Cleansing Foam](https://www.amazon.com/Cleansing-Story-Natural-Facial-5-19oz/dp/B06XK73KQW/) \- Water Based Cleanser - I have used this back in 2017 when I lived in Asia and I liked it a lot back then! It is a bit soapy (scent-wise), it's a rich face gel and it's got a lovely velvety texture.

* [Holika Holika Lazy & Easy Smooth Egg Peeling Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Holika-Lazy-Easy-Smooth-Peeling/dp/B01H7UDMGE/) \- Exfoliator - This has been a big hit for me in the past. At first I bought it because of the novelty of Gudetama (who can resist that Lazy Lil Egg?!) I actually really like this product. It smells like baby powder. it comes out in an egg white consistency. I just smear it on my face and wait for a minute or two (in the morning while my shower heats up) and then I massage my face. It pills up, no clue if it is actually removing dead skin but I swear I look more awake (possibly because I am massaging my face?) but my skin also looks a lot clearer! **$2.99**

* [Nature Republic 80% Aloe Vera Soothing and Moisture](https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Republic-Soothing-Moisture-Emulsion/dp/B01EV2BFJM/) \- Body Lotion - I used this on my legs after shaving and they feel so smooth, I like the smell (it reminds me of Cool Waters by Davidoff?) I just wish it had a pump and was not a pour top as the product is very thick. **$4.99**
* [Boscia - Revitalizing Black Hydration Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Boscia-Revitalizing-Black-Hydration-Gel/dp/B07L387YT3/) \- Face Moisturizer - I had the Boscia Tsubaki Splash Mask back in 2015/16 and I wanted to try this out. I am patch testing this product before putting on my face. I am a little meh about the smell, it smells like citronella/geranium/natural bug spray. I might just end up using it on my body rather than my face. **$3.99**
* [Neogen - Real Fresh Foam Cereal - Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/NEOGEN-Dermalogy-Fresh-cleansing-Cereal/dp/B06Y1TQYLC/) \- I have used the Green Tea version of this and I loved it so much. I hear Rice/Fermented Grains are good for brightening skin/fading acne so I thought I'd give it a whirl! **$3.99**
* [H20+ Beauty Waterbright Dark Spot Corrector](https://www.amazon.com/H2O-Beauty-Waterbright-Corrector-Powerfully/dp/B01G8UTFHE/) \- Spot Treatment - Never tried this before but it looked interesting. I will use this as a spot treatment. I will test it on an old, small burn scar on my inner arm before using on my face. **$4.99**
* [Mitomo Rice Leaven Essence Mask](https://www.amazon.com/MITOMO-Uruuru-Quality-Japan-Leaven/dp/B071D8YBB6/) \- 6x Sheet Masks - Also never tried this but I thought for **$3.99** and 6 masks I'd try it out.

1. My routine:

* **AM** I use a teaspoon sized amount of ***Holika Holika Lazy & Easy Peel,*** I massage for about 3 minutes followed by a pea-sized amount of ***Erborian Solid Cleansing Balm*** before stepping in the shower. Next I wash in the shower with ***Cerave Foaming Cleanser***, about two pumps. After my shower, I pat my face dry (not rub). Then I massage a thin layer of *C****erave Day Lotion*** in and a generous amount of *Biore UV Aqua Rich* Watery Gel 50 SPF. Swipe on a bit of mascara (***Estee Lauder***), bit of blush on my cheeks (***Nars***) and I am out the door.
* **PM** Splash my face with tepid water for a minute or two, then I wipe my mascara off with ***Lancôme Bi-Facil Double-Action Eye Makeup Remover + a cotton round*** and then go in with a pea sized amount of ***Erborian Solid Cleanser***. Then I wash in slightly cooler water with ***Cerave Foaming Cleanser***. I pat dry and then I wipe with ***Thayer's Witch Hazel and Rose Water Toner,*** then I massage in 4 drops of ***Mad Hippie Vitamin C Serum***. I finish it all off with a nice thick layer of ***Cerave Night Repair Cream (purple tub)****.*

I am a 23 year old graduate student who developed cystic jaw acne for the first time in my life about 5 weeks ago. I am terrified of it spreading, or getting worse, and am not sure that the routine I am doing is helping at all so I would greatly appreciate any advice. I have always had mild acne, was never super consistent with skin care, and generally let my skin even out on its own. This summer, (the first picture), I developed more of a consistent routine and my acne marks started to fade/skin cleared up. As you can see, it still wasn't anywhere near great, but it was getting better and I was optimistic about the results I was seeing.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v4n950yxjsr31.jpg

5 weeks ago or so, right before my last period, my jaw erupted into painful, itchy under-the-surface cysts on both sides. I panicked, doubled down on the exfoliating, and exacerbated the issue until I realized that I needed to switch to a gentler cleanser. From everything I have read, I understand this is a hormonal imbalance and have already seen a dermatologist to discuss next steps. I've also begun taking probiotics, upping my water intake, switched to a gentler routine/stronger spf, and have cut out dairy/refined carbs.

The cysts are so itchy they keep me up at night, I am overwhelmed by the different products, and really have no idea whether to listen to the derm's suggestion of birth control/antibiotics after hearing horror stories of the acne returning even worse in the end. Thank you so much for any help you can offer in advance.

71,"Hey everybody. Longtime lurker lol. I just found something out that I thought I should share because I have never ever read it on here before!

I use a sunscreen primer by Shiseido as well as SPF foundation for morning/work day inside with no windows. Before I go home, I put on a cheaper Aveeno sunscreen SPF 45 on top just while I walk home, since I walk directly into the sunlight. It's a sensitive skin type as well.

Every day, walking home, my eyes water uncontrollably. People see me and think I’m sobbing. I’ve ignored it, assuming it was my eyes watering from the sun.

I finally looked into it and asked my doctor, especially because my vision has been gradually getting worse. Turns out certain sunscreens close enough to your eyes/in your eyes can cause chemical burns!!! Now, I always made a point to put sunscreen around my eyes, because I always read that sunscreen is a good anti age prevention, sun = ages your skin, etc etc... now I’ve really screwed up my eyes! I’m not going to continue using the Aveeno, only Shiseido since my skin seems to respond a lot better to that one.

Maybe I’m an idiot for not knowing this, but I just wanted to post something about it to let people know who might have been not too knowledgeable about this like I was. I thought I knew it all but apparently not.

I’m assuming this is due to ingredients? Does anybody else have any light to shed on this? I’m freaked out doing this daily for almost a year has totally ruined my eyes now! I have never experienced this with Shiseido or the IT cosmetics SPF stuff I use, so I am going to assume it's the Aveeno since that's the only time it happens.

(Edit: I occasionally use Vichy micellar water to take the sunscreen off, but it burns my eyes even worse than sunscreen. Literally feels like I am pouring pure rubbing alcohol in my eyes. I try to use it as little as possible now, but it’s got me wondering - is that the sunscreen burning my eyes even more? Or should I not use micellar water? My typical makeup remover is green clean farmacy cleansing balm...)

I'm sorry if I have somehow posted this more than once because every other time was literally a different reason why I couldn't post so this should hopefully be the only post here...)",1570745767.0,[Sun Care] I've made a huge mistake,0.94

So I have been in a constant struggle trying to balance my skin out because it easily gets dehydrated and dry but I also suffer from pretty recurrent breakouts. They are mostly on my cheeks and lately I've been getting some bumps on my forehead as well. 

Most recently I was using the Aveeno ultra calming foaming cleanser, clinique acne solutions clarifying lotion and dramatically different moisturizing gel. Although the clinique toner was helping my breakouts and clearing them up, it was also irritating and drying my skin out and I developed flaky skin on my cheeks and dry patches near my mouth. Since it has alcohol and witch hazel it was overkill for my skin. I purchased ole henriksen balancing force oil control toner  because it has both aha/bha and is alcohol free (but still has witch hazel) but I want to able to use it but not dry my skin out.

The aveeno cleanser and clinique moisturizer as far as i'm concerned don't break me out, so i'm scared to switch them out. i'm considering adding more hydrating products and tweak my routine that way? 

for morning i'm considering to skip cleansing. i have a micellar water i can use called it cosmetics miracle water. it has lots of good ingredients and if anything is hydrating, has green tea, collagen, peptides etc. i can either use this or nothing at all and just go straight to moisturizer. would love some advice on my morning routine in this regard.

Luckily it was really only on the outside of my upper arms so it wasn't a big deal. In the last few months I \[hadn't\] changed anything about how I treated my skin but all of a sudden it spread to the inside of my arms, up on to my shoulder (really bad bumps but no redness so far), down to my forearms a bit and I think possibly even my inner thighs and back of my calves.

In the evenings before bed I've been applying The Ordinary SA onto the worst spots then CeraVe SA onto all affected areas. None of this has made any difference so far except maybe the redness on the outside of my arms has been reduced.

I didnt know if Niacinimide was the culprit because it was my first Niacinimide product and it also had other mildly irritating ingredients in it. My skin didnt react in just one day. It progressively got worse and worse until I finally stopped using the product. 

Skin was rough all over, skin felt dehydrated for some reason, and if you looked closely at my skin, it was like every pore was inflamed but in really tiny bumps! My skin would get really itchy sometimes and Id get a random zit just from the itching which was so weird. So I stopped that and I just remember that it took weeks to get my skin back to normal.

Fast forward to now, I just bought the best sunscreen Ive ever used a week ago. Its the Rire Silky Sun Milk. Its so cheap for 50ml! No alcohol. It was so lightweight I couldnt feel it on my skin unlike the Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk that Ive been previously using. The finish wasnt sticky at all. It was a satin finish. It had this light floral scent that disappears after awhile. Im not a fan of scents but smelling this while putting it on made me feel happy lol. This was my dream sunscreen!!! WAS!!!

On the 3rd day of using it my skin started to look awful again. It reminded me so much of the time I reacted to the essence so I immediately looked up the ingredients. BAM! Niacinimide as the 3rd ingredient. My skin started getting itchy again and it was just roughville all over. I wanted to love this so much but my skin just hates it.

5,"Hello :) I am 28, female and my skin is very sensitive and dehydrated. Unfortunately, I also still am suffering from hormonal acne, especially on my jawline, neck, forehead and cheeks. Also when I have a lot of stress, I get a lot of spots. I also have Rosacea. 

I am thinking about incorporating an acid peeling from The Ordinary into my skin care routine to get rid of my acne, but I'm not sure if an acid peeling would work for my skin. So far, I am only using a mild cleanser and a light moisturizer for sensitive skin (by Bioderma).

I have seen that TO sells a lot of different acid peelings, but I am not sure which one would help my skin. I have thought about the 7% Glycolic Acid toner or the 5% Lactic Acid & HA serum. I have used glycolic acid in the past (a higher concentrated product), but my skin didn't tolerate it - it got red, itchy, inflamed and I broke out. Would it make sense to try glycolic acid again or would another acid be better? Would it generally be helpful to incorporate an acid peeling into my skin care routine? Do you maybe have other product recommendations? 

Thank you!",1570708703.0,[Skin concern] Which TO acid is good for my skin type?,0.25
5,"Hi guys,

So I think my skin had a bad reaction to either TO Niacinamide or/and the acid hyaluronic serum. I' tried them both last week and this is was happened after a few days. I've stopped using them but now my skin feels really rough and dry and I really don't know what to do :(. It's weird because I always has a hydrated and soft skin. I'm so disappointed because I finally had some peace and wanted to treat my scars and PIE but now it feels like I ruined everything. I have many small comedons now, and a lighter wallet to top it off. 
I'm trying to keep it low-key, here's my emergency/damage control routine:

AM
*spray face with rose water
*apply jojoba oil + squalane
*if I'm going out my day cream Laboratoire Novexpert Fluid pureté (French brand made with zinc, very light, worked okayish)
*Australian Gold tinted sunscreen 
*make up sometimes (Lily Lolo mineral makeup) 

PM
*OCM + a bar soap made with donkey milk if I've applied makeup
*rose water or sukin hydrating toner
*jojoba oil + squalane (and sometimes a drop of argan oil)

A few more info :
I'm pretty convinced that my barrier is damaged on my chin, which is why I'm very prone to white heads here (here's the tea: I once or twice used an antiseptic to dry out some pimples... But my face never recovered and if I exfoliate there I get tons of white heads, it's honestly disgusting) (yes, I'm a dumb ass) 
I think my zinc day cream and the niacinamide + zinc serum might have been too much for my skin? Also this cream does not moisturize my skin enough (currently living in Quebec, Canada). I'm scared of exfoliating bc every time I do it, I break out. I have never tried any type of acid. 
I have an EXTREMELY sensitive and reactive and acne prone skin, as well as dehydrated and combination. Most products if they don't break me out give me some kind of texture (like very small pimples).
 Here are some pictures (it looks worse in reality) http://imgur.com/gallery/pgqh3w1

If anyone has any type of advise or recommendation for a very picky skin it is welcomed. Especially for hydration and moisture (would aloe Vera be enough?) . I was thinking of trying the cerave lotion bc I've seen it everywhere here, but I usually only try natural and cruelty free products...

A few months ago, I took in a stray cat into my new apartment and my idiot ass didn't wash the cat or check it for fleas. And lo and behold, my place got a flea infection and I ended up passing the cat along to someone else for a bit to take care of and wash. And because I'm an idiot, I scratched the shit out of those bites and left scars everywhere on my legs. There are literally dozens of dark spots on my legs and ankles and they are very unattractive. I used to like to wear dresses a lot and now I don't and always wear a long sleeve cardigan even when its hot as crap outside because I am embarassed by a few of the dark spots on my arms. In fact, this whole thing has made me anti social and I don't even go out because I don't want people to gawk at my spots and ask me what happened or think I'm some kind of junkie.

The past few months, I've tried dry brushing my skin daily, applying lotion twice a day and I also exfoliate in the shower. I've used Vitamin E lotion, Vitamin C serum, a couple of random scar gels/creams and rosehip oil and coconut oil lotion. They barely look like they're fading. I'm starting to wonder if they will ever go away and it's making me depressed. I know it'll take time for them to disappear but can anyone recommend something that might work better than what I am already doing? I feel like I can't even date now because I'm worried if I ever get to the point where my clothes come off, the guy will be grossed out by all the dark spots and it'll just be weird.

1,"I’m just wondering if anyone else has had this experience! 

I have used cetaphil moisturiser for a few years now. My dr recommend it to me because it’s “non comedogenic” - she said it was designed to keep me from breaking out. Looking back on this, I shouldn’t have prioritised that - I don’t really have problems with acne, just with red patches that seem to be under the top layer of my skin... I don’t really know what it is...

Anyway, I’ve been using cetaphil but lately I’ve been noticing more and more that it just doesn’t feel nice when I put it on, it’s like thin and oily. My skin is super dry so I want something hydrating.

I tried E45 just under my eyes and holy fuck, my skin feels so SOFT and it’s like a dream to put on, it feels right putting it on and I think I can see skin improvements already. I think I’m going to start using it all over my face.

I just got a new thing of cetaphil though, and it’s so expensive! haha. Sometimes cetaphil would also burn a little when I put it on.. i have to recognise this isn’t normal! i thought that was just from the rubbing motion on my face, not the moisturiser itself, but with E45 i dont feel anything.

I need Fraxel treatments, but skin care will just have to do for now. Nothing really seems to work, and I still have to wear Dermacol foundation. So tonight I bit the bullet and got some products from The Ordinary. I sent them a lengthy message on Facebook. I described all my skin issues and told them that things like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and retinol don't work for me. They answered almost immediately and recommended some products as well as an AM and PM routine. I love this company already.

They recommended:

1. The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5
2. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
3. The Ordinary Mandelic Acid 10% + HA
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA
5. The Ordinary Mineral UV Filters SPF 30 with Antioxidants

I got everything but the sunscreen and moisturizer, as a Redditor gifted me [this](https://www.amazon.com/Benton-Snail-High-Content-Lotion/dp/B01LWM0VDZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp) moisturizer, and it still has plenty left. I was also concerned about overspending, because money. But if you spend $25, shipping is free. So I calculated it, and 4 products + $0 shipping is cheaper than 3 products + $5 shipping. So that left me with the sunscreen, which I decided to skip (I know, I know).

And then I second-guessed myself, and decided to just check and see how much the sunscreen would cost. But they're [sold out](https://deciem.com/product/rdn-mineral-uv-filters-spf-30-with-antioxidants-50ml). So I just told myself that $10 was too much to pay for 50 mL of product anyway, and gave up on the idea.

Which brings me to the reason I wrote this post. I know you aren't supposed to use sunscreen on your face unless the label specifies that it's non-comedogenic. But [this](https://imgur.com/a/o03ClC2) is all I have. On the back, in the section that says ""Directions,"" it says, ""do not spray into face. Spray into hand and apply to face."" So I guess maybe it would be okay on my face? I'm not sure. I know every person's skin is different. But I just want to make sure I'm not about to murder my face.

I have a lot of nervous habits like nail biting and hair pulling, but skin picking in particular I got diagnosed with as a disorder. Cue a lifelong refusal from my parents to take me to a dermatologist. They said that there was no point in me getting my skin clear with expensive products if I'm just going to pick at it anyways.

So here I am, 18, in college, and super self conscious about my skin. When you pick at your skin so much you tend to forget other people DONT do it as well, so seeing everyone with clear skin is really difficult. And I want to change this.

There's not really medicine to fight the impulses (I've tried many) so I have to work with what I have, which is my skincare routine. I've never really had a set skincare routine because standing in front of a mirror alone makes me pick at my skin obsessively (also what my parents kept repeating to me made me give up on my skin), but God do I want to change this.

I have dry skin that tends to flake a lot which contributes to me picking it off, really bad skin texture and a lot of scarring. Small breakouts are really common too, I do tend to have acne, and my nose looks like a strawberry

After watching a lot of videos I bought Cerave SA cleanser and lotion for bumpy skin. That's all I have for now, since it is an investment. I'm also scared of a lot of exfoliants since my skin has a lot of lesions.

33,"Hi, community.

I've been vocal here about how this subreddit fosters a culture of obsession, fixation, dysmorphia, and anxiety. Unfortunately, I've been letting myself get sucked into the very mindset that I've been criticizing. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for over a decade, and some time last year, I discovered the world of skincare. My money started disappearing, my bathroom storage started shrinking, and I started planning my social life around my skincare regimen--*no, I'm not going to that concert, because that's mask night and I won't do masks if I come home drunk.*

I didn't realize how much I loved the control of collecting and crafting a skincare routine until I got a rush after an unexpected breakout. I had a new project! I had a new problem to solve! I had something new to fixate on! My skincare fixation escalated to creating daily spreadsheets that covered everything from the weather to my caloric intake.

My skin was getting better, but the rest of my life was looking really shitty. I was letting my spreadsheets get in the way of my actual work spreadsheets, I was sacrificing time with my fiance to stay holed up in my bathroom, and I was recklessly spending money on new products. A depressive episode hit me like a sucker punch and I realized that I was sacrificing time dedicated to other forms of grooming (shaving, waxing, ironing my clothes, etc.) just to expand my AM and PM skincare routines.

In short, I was really letting myself go, while convincing myself that I was keeping it together because my skin looked great and I had shiny new toys to play with at my bathroom sink. I finally hit a really low low and went to a new psychiatrist. She told me that she thinks I have some OCD symptoms (intrusive thoughts, unhealthy fixations, panic over routines) and prescribed an SNRI that is used to treat depression, anxiety, and mild OCD.

I've been on this medication for a month now and I've cut my skincare routine down to a cleanser, toner, treatment, moisturizer, and sunscreen. I threw all of the products I don't use into a box and gave it to my neighbor to pick through. I told her to give away what she didn't want so I didn't have to see it again.

My skin is still clear, but I'm now devoting time and headspace to my job, my relationship, and my social life. My job performance has skyrocketed, I'm delighting in spending evenings with my fiance again, and I'm more social than I've been since college.

It's not okay to let this shit run your life. If you think you're channeling your mental illness into your skincare routine, think hard about why you do that and how you can make it better. It took a new medication to force me to have this realization, but I'm so happy that I did.

Editing to add: you might not strike luck on your first attempt at treating your mental illness. This certainly was not my first attempt. Please don't think that I took a magic pill! Xoxo",1570647531.0,[Personal] Changing antidepressants helped cure my skincare fixation.,0.96

It itches and it gets worse after wearing makeup or sweating and no amount of benzoyl Peroxide or salicylic acid or lactic acid reduces the size. In fact with each swipe of cream my spots became more aggressive.

Alas I googled “yeast acne” ( after popping a spot that had a smell that reminded me of yeast) TMI, I know but this brought up the term fungal acne and a whole new insight. I bought 1% clotrimazole cream and zinc pyrithione anti dandruff shampoo. This started a whole new routine and within a few days my face transformed. 

In a week my face was “normalish” a few spots here and there and I stopped my routine( maybe a bit too early) But it all came back albeit not as bad. 

Fast forward and I decided to get a doctors appointment hoping to be prescribed an oral antifungal or something stronger. To my surprise despite all that’s happened she said it doesn’t look like fungal acne and then refused to give me any medication other than typical acne treatments (which I already told her irritated the spots further). She also didn’t want to do any tests because she was so sure she was right. She prescribed me another cream containing benzoyl Peroxide!? Should I listen to her? Does this make sense?

On the positive side, it's great to see more Western (and big name) companies looking into more sustainable options, but I was disappointed to see that it's on a trial basis and that it's being sold for an astronomical price ($59 for the moisturizer and refill; though at least for this particular product, it's helpful to note that the proceeds will go to a good cause!). 

I suppose the trial basis is logical since they have to make a profit, but I suspect it will be a profitable endeavor in the future, particularly for popular products. I think if a product came in pretty nice packaging and I could just buy a recyclable refill, I would have some decent incentive to rebuy. 

I'd also note that while I think the price is ridiculous, it matches the price they generally sell that moisturizer at. I'm hoping/looking forward to what other more affordable brands (e.g. CeraVe and Neutrogena) will do.

I started micro needling at home with Dr. Pen Ultima A6 for my bad acne scars on both of my cheeks. I have noticed that for length below maybe 1mm, the needles would retract under the cartridge, and poke out. So for these length, I think it would be okay to drag the pen across the whole area like the video we see everywhere online.

However, for length let's say 2mm or more, the needles are constantly extended above the cartridge shield even at retracted state (verified with iPhone slow-motion video). So I was wondering, for those of you who DIY at home and the professionals, would you drag with a long needle length, or lift and stamp across the face?

2,"I had a bad breakout two weeks ago so I got an acne facial with a new to me esthetician last night. Facial went well, did some masks, led light therapy, extractions, ultrasound(?) therapy. 

It was a very acid forward facial. As a last step before applying moisturizer she used this serum on me with 10% glycolic, 10% lactic, and 5% salicylic. My entire face had no reaction except for some slight tingling when the product was first placed but on my left check it immediately started frosting.  The esthetician quickly cleaned off that side of my face with water and applied a hydrating gel mask to sit there for a few minutes. 

She explained what happened and said it’ll peel and to wear sunscreen everyday. She also said not to exfoliate for at least 5 days. (I plan on waiting a week since multiple acids were involved in the facial). 

This morning though I woke up and the two pimples where the serum had a bad reaction turned a dark brown.  Below is a link with pics of that side of my face at 2 hrs after the facial, 4 hrs after, and 12 hrs after.

I always have closed comedones all on either side of my chin close to my jawline that just won't move. I use prescription tretinion (.025%) and Paula's choice BHA exfoliant a few times a week (not together) and they help with my other acne but these little bumps never seem to move. About 6 months ago I gave 10% bp a whirl and they cleared those comedones right up but I also ended up looking like shireen from game of thrones for about 10 days.

I decided to give it another try on Saturday (dumb, I know) and see if I used a much smaller amount and no other actives I wouldn't have the same reaction. To be fair, it is a lot better than what happened last time, I'm not flaking or oozing but it feels very dry and textured and stings when anything is applied to it.

5,"Hello, something that's really causing me to go into 'paralysis by analysis' mode is the fact that everything can 'clog' your pores. Honestly people say to patch test and all, and that's what causes me to obsess about these things. I can't say for sure if something really caused me pimple even if I patch test, because I also get pimples in places where I don't patch test. Even if pimple doesn't appear after X amount of time, somewhere down the line it will pop up in that place, forcing me to think it's the product that caused it. 

People also say that even Tretinoin cream can cause clogged pores because of the inactive ingredients, making your breakouts even worse. This to me seems paradoxical, because the whole point of it is to unclog pores. You also need cleanser, sunscreen and moisturizer along side your treatment, but how can I know if they clog me up before starting treatment if I don't have clear skin, it's impossible. Yes you can find a patch of skin that 'generally' doesn't break out, but even if you do breakout, it could just be a random break out, diet, hormonal changes, million different things. You'd have to recreate the same conditions every time you test a product, which seems impossible.

So, I live in Slovenia, and I have no way of buying EltaMD products from anywhere here. So, I turned to UK Amazon - being the only place I can order to my country. A while after the purchase, I wanted to send the listing to my friends asking where I found it, and that's when I noticed a whole bunch of comments saying the product is a fake, but also a bunch of saying its fine. The listing had more buying options, so I guess that's where the confusion comes from..  the bad reviews didn't specify what seller.  


First thing, I wrote an email to the seller, but of course, they assured me, that the product isn't a fake - but I mean, I didn't really expect them to admit to it, as that breaks Amazon policy. I'm only worried, because my order was fullfilled by the seller, and because the item was a bit cheaper - about 28$ with no postage. I was checking the box, it was sent from USA to Germany, from Germany to me. That can't be cheap, sure as hell isn't free, and I know how free postage works, it's usually embedded in the product price, not hurting the margin.   


Now, I've read every bad review. Mostly they said that the original is kinda buttery and sinks in lovely, while the fake one is super oily and weirdly colored. My sunscreen is buttery-siliconey, has a normal tint that doesn't really add anything to the face (kinda like the Coola mineral tinted). It sank in completely, leaving kind of a powdery finish. It's matt, but not drying like Korean physical sunscreens. 

I like the sunscreen. Scratch that, I really love it. But I'm hesitant to use it, as I am still a bit doubtfull about what I am putting on my face. I am acne prone and somewhat sensitive, so I fear doing serious damage..   


Anyone here bought a fake and can make a comparison? Anyone here that has the original, and can tell me if my review sounds right? Maybe send me some pictures? I checked the pictures on Dermstore, and the blob of sunscreen looks exactly like what I have - same consistency, same color.. so do the box and the tube.   


This is my first purchase of this sunscreen, so I have nothing to compare it to. Any advice on a website or Amazon/Ebay seller where I can be sure I am buying the original? It needs to send to EU (Slovenia).. Thanks for your help.",1570619396.0,[Product question] EltaMD UV Physical Broad-spectrum SPF41 tinted sunscreen,1.0
3,"Hey guys, 

I'm pretty confused about where to start. I'm really a noob when it comes to skincare products. 

I'll just try to list out all the details which I can give you. Please feel free to ask me if you want any additional details. 

Sorry for the long post in advance. 

I hope this subreddit can help me. I've seen pretty promising posts in here. 

# All about my skin

* **Combination Skin**: I believe I have combination skin because my T-zone gets pretty oily within like 15 minutes of washing and the rest of the face just dries out (depending on weather). Also, it is important to mention that I sweat a lot. I have a lot of heat flashes because of PCOS. 
* **Concern - Acne/Blackheads/Whiteheads/Pores**: I have had pretty horrible acne as a teenager. Now, I don't break out as much but I have pretty large pores on my skin. I accumulate black and whiteheads pretty quickly. (Like, within a week of getting a professional clean-up, you could see a  significant number of white and blackheads.) IDK if this is relevant, but I have PCOS and a hormonal imbalance, therefore. Though I don't have any hormonal acne, I believe hormonal imbalances do otherwise affect the skin. You'll have to confirm though.
* **Concern - Sensitive Skin/ (Sunburn?)** \- I can't say I have overly sensitive skin as I don't react as much to most products. But, in a full-body scan which included a scan of my skin, my doctor showed me that the top 4 layers of my exposed skin (face) has a sun-tan (I'm guessing he means sunburn or sun damage). 
* **Back-ne**: As a teenager, I was host to a lot of dandruff. My dermatologist from then has mentioned that this dandruff had resulted in a lot of acne on my shoulders and back (face too). On this day, though I don't have dandruff (except sometimes in harsh winters), I still have some back-ne. 

# Products I use 

I don't really have a routine as such, but I'll just list here the products I currently use. 

* **Cleanser**: I use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser twice a day, once in the morning, one at night before sleeping. (Sometimes thrice depending on activity) 
* **Toner**: I use [this](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01LWPEJEP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) toner right after cleansing my skin with Cetaphil at night. I do live in one of the most polluted cities in the WORLD. 
* **Moisturizing Cream**: (I know I'll face a significant amount of criticism for this) I do not moisturize my face in the morning. I feel like my natural skin oils do the job just fine. At night, after using the toner I use this [Calamine lotion](https://www.amazon.in/Lacto-Calamine-Lotion-Balance-Combination/dp/B071SDS4ZM/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=lacto+calamine&qid=1570621502&sr=8-5). I feel like this doesn't make my skin oily, but with enough movement and sweat, even this makes my face feel heavy.  
* **Sunscreen**: Due to popular recommendations, I purchased the [Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF](https://www.amazon.in/Neutrogena-Ultra-Sheer-Dry-Touch-Sunblock/dp/B000EPA4GQ/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=neutrogena+spf&qid=1570621619&sr=8-3). I was very disappointed. This did end up leaving a shiny layer on my face, and the more I sweat, the shinier it got. I also felt like I sweat more because of it. So, at the moment I just use a [Lakme sunscreen](https://www.amazon.in/Lakme-Sun-Expert-Lotion-120ml/dp/B008KH4YKC/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=lakme+spf&qid=1570621718&sr=8-3) for the other parts of my body, but yes, my face does not have any moisturizer or sunscreen when I leave home.
* **Exfoliation**: I use [Clean and Clear's daily scrub](https://www.amazon.in/Clean-Clear-Black-Head-Scrub/dp/B01CGEV5H4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=clean+and+clear+scrub+daily&qid=1570622030&s=pantry&sr=8-1) maybe once a week, depending on how much my skin is exposed to pollution. Every Sunday I use a herbal apricot scrub. Mid-week I use my ultrasonic skin scrubber with Cetaphil on the peeling mode. Once a month I do a routine with steam, scrub, extractions (using ultrasonic skin scrubber) ending with a face mask (by Face Shop usually). 

I also work on a budget, as you can tell from my usage of drugstore products. I'd appreciate it if you could give me advice about cheaper alternatives.

6,"Hi guys! Just need a bit of feedback on my routine, 
and advice if possible. Apologies for formatting; on mobile. Also can't figure out spacing??


Skin type: combination, acne prone. Am on birth control(Yaz).


Concerns: hyperpigmentation(quite severe on cheeks at the moment, makes my acne look worse than it is), texture, scarring, active acne(majority is surface acne, but a few are deeper and more cystic).


Current routine:


AM: 

CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser; Hado Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion on damp skin; The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1%; The Ordinary ECGC + Caffeine 5% on under eye contour only; The Ordinary Hemi-Squalane; Neutrogena HydroBoost moisturiser (Emulsion); Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50.


PM: alternating


Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil; CeraVe Foaming Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser(depending on how my skin feels); CeraVe Daily Moisturising Lotion on damp skin; Vaseline around eyes, corners of mouth, nose, and on lips; Differin applied all over face 20mins after moisturiser. 


OR 


Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil; CeraVe Foaming Cleanser or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser(depending on how my skin feels); Hado Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion on damp skin; The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% and Zinc 1%; The Ordinary ECGC + Caffeine 5% on under eye contour only; The Ordinary Hemi-Squalane; CeraVe Daily Moisturising Lotion. 


My acne is quite bad at the moment(for me) and the breakouts around my mouth and on my lower cheeks are refusing to subside. I have only been on Differin for about 4-5 weeks now, so I know it's probably purging, but it still sucks. So far I haven't had any dryness, just a little more red than normal and occasionally mildly itchy. 


I'm going on holiday in just under a month, and am praying to the gods my skin clears just a little xD


I want to add 2.5% Benzac(benzoyl peroxide) on the nights where I'm not using Differin to try and quell the breakouts. I've heard that a lower percentage and short contact therapy works just as well as leaving it on overnight, so that is my plan for the moment. I'm just a bit nervous - I saw some comments saying BP and Differin at the same time can ruin your moisture barrier, and you only realise that's happened once it's too late.


Has anyone used Differin and BP at the same time? Any advice?

8,"Hey guys, I like to take cold showers, but am worried that they are impeding my skins progress (dealing with mild acne and hyperpigmentation). Usually, I wake up and rinse my face with warm water to open the pores, then I cleanse using cetaphil gentle cleanser. Next I take my cold shower (which I think somewhat tightens/closes my pores, hence my concern) and then procédé with the rest of my routine (TO niacinamide, CeraVe two in one moisturiser sunscreen, and finally TO Azelaic acid) but I’m concerned that because of the cold water from my shower, the amount of the rest of my routine that is absorbed might be limited.
