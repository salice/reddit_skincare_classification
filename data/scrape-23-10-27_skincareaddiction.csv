Help with forehead (closed comedones? Another problem?) [Acne],"https://i.imgur.com/ok7QZTe_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium

https://i.imgur.com/ptYM5ia_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium

I have had acne since I hit puberty (now I'm 25). Was getting better last few years, and it's not /that/ bad now but since I went off birth control this year for medication reasons it got bad again in my chin area.

Anyway, the point of this post though is to figure out the texture of my forehead. It got better in recent years, I think from chemical exfoliants. But this year it started getting like this again. 

I'm wondering if it started again because I've been working out consistently every other day, and I wasn't washing my face most of the time right after (and I'd sweat). The other day I bought micellar water and cotton pads to use at the gym but I've only done that a couple times so far.

I thought maybe it was that fungal infection but sulfur didn't do anything. Also noticed it started up after I began consistently using The Ordinary's granactive retinoid 2% emulsion on my forehead, but previously I had used that less consistently on PIH/PIE areas with no problems...

Thinking of going to a dermatologist again, if my medical can cover it.

Current routine (that I try to keep consistent...):

AM
Wash with just water OR Vanicream gentle cleanser 

Moisturize with Hado Lobo gokujyun premium hyaluronic solution OR Dr Lin's moisturizing gel


PM 
Wash with Vanicream gentle cleanser 

Moisturize with Hado Lobo gokujyun premium hyaluronic solution OR Dr Lin's moisturizing gel

[Reviews] Krave Oat So Simple Review on normal-acne prone skin.,"I just used it for the first time last night and won't use again. I bought it because my normal-acne prone-fungal acne prone skin (that is pretty clear now) loves gel moisturizers and this has none of my triggers (dimethicone and fragrance). And also I wanted to try squalane in different form because pure squalane didn't work on me.

The texture is a silky light gel lotion, has a faint clean smell. Upon application my face felt pretty silky, but the next day I woke up feeling and looking dry with a couple of skin colored bumps. I am suspecting the squalane. 

Can't comment on packaging because I got a shared in 5 ml jar.

Overall I can't recommend this to anybody. Not even oily skin, because good products for oily skin would make my skin feel balanced, not dry. 

Pretty shocked too with the alleged removal of negative comments by Krave.

In case you guys interested, moisturizers that work for me are Supergoop Superscreen and I'm From Water Gel.",1572234547.0,0.87,0

"[Routine Help] Teeny tiny bumps on outer cheeks, chin, and jaw. Has anyone had a similar experience with dehydrated skin or damaged skin/moisture barrier? I had smooth skin up until a few weeks ago...","I will TRY to make this as short as possible.


I had a similar issue to this in the spring. Very, very small bumps on my outer cheeks and my chin, I would say that they looked smaller than the average CC. They gave my skin a very rough, sandpapery texture. I ended up breaking out HORRIBLY, to the point where I had probably upwards of 50 or so active, painful, large lesions on my face. I started using tretinoin 0.025% and a low dose of minocycline for a few months until I completed the antibiotic and then eventually upped my tret dosage to 0.05% and continued on. My progress at this point was fantastic and my skin was very smooth. 


Nearing the end of September, my skin started to get a little bit rough in texture, similar to the spring, but I would not yet describe it as having small bumps or anything like that quite yet. To others, it probably still looked smooth. I started to break out a little bit and my skin got bumpier, at which point I saw two doctors who both described it as perioral dermatitis as I had the characteristic redness in my central face. One of them prescribed Metronidazole gel and upped my tretinoin dosage to 0.1% and the other prescribed 1000mg of tetracycline per day. Fast forward to now, my skin was SO flaky the past few weeks and I did not know why, I continued to apply to tretinoin every day and I literally had to scrub the skin off of my face (bad idea, I know), as well as use glycolic acid in hopes it would be less flaky (also bad idea, I know).  Two weeks ago it started to get really bad and I was breaking out badly. Then one week ago I decided to just attack my face with mass amounts of moisture in hopes that it all clears. Some of the products are new, because I did not have a lot of moisture in my routine prior.


My current routine for the last week-ish:

AM:

\-CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, on a wet face, several layers

\-Uriage Bariederm Insulating Repairing Cream, also a couple of extra layers if needed

\-Indeed Laboratories Squalane Oil

\-CosRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream

\-Banana Boat Simply Protect SPF 50


PM:

\-Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water, to remove some of my makeup, I use this very gently on a cotton pad

\-Indeed Laboratories Squalane Oil, to remove the rest of my makeup

\-Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water, to remove the oil and makeup residue

\-CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, on a wet face, several layers

\-Uriage Bariederm Insulating Repairing Cream, also a couple of extra layers if needed

\-Indeed Laboratories Squalane Oil

\-CosRX Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream

\-Vaseline, on lips and face as needed


So far, my face has calmed down a lot since starting all of this hydration. The active acne has calmed down a tiny bit, but it’s tough to tell because I am still getting new spots every day. Otherwise, it doesn’t hurt to open my mouth anymore (lol) and the peeling has subsided quite a bit, just some flaking left to go away.

BUT, the bumps haven’t budged at all. And I get scared everyday that they’re getting worse, it’s really difficult to tell if they are or not. I’m also scared nonstop that something I’m using will clog my skin. I’m so depressed about my skin, but genuinely wondering if maybe lack of hydration has been a long standing issue with my recurring acne. Even in the summer when my skin was good, I suspect that I needed more moisture. 

Has anyone else’s dehydration or impaired barrier given them these kind of little tiny sandpaper bumps? Did they eventually go away or did they all come to the surface like raging pimples? Any extra tips or product recs?

Edit: I am 100% sure it is not fungal, confirmed this via extraction under woods lamp.

[product question] Moisturiser for Tret,"Hi all,

I've just been prescribed Tretinoin for the first time. At the same time as getting that prescription, my dermatologist recommended I start using LRP Toleriane cleanser and moisturiser as I would ""need something a bit more nourishing"". I dutifully went out and bought them but the moisturiser in particular only comes in a 40ml bottle and I'm not sure I can afford to keep paying full retail price for such a tiny bottle.

I've gone through a million moisturisers before and I've been pretty happy with most of them but I'm not sure which of them would fit the ""more nourishing"" bill. 

Any recommendations would be awesome. I'm in Australia so my options can be quite limited. I also live in quite a dry part of Australia so I've found HA (as a final step) to go more harm than good.",1572231120.0,1.0,1

I just wash my face in the shower and use hot water, maybe use some Aloe Vera gel, but that's about it

First, I will let you know that I looked at the resources in this community that help with finding skin types and concerns, but that has left me much more confused sadly. It almost feels as my skin has a lot of issues where I can't really figure out what it really needs. My T-zone is quite oily and has a somewhat bumpy texture, but once I wash my face, my skin feels tight and sometimes gets flaky and I can rub the dead skin off once it is wet. My cheeks are dry and I can see little cracks of skin due to the dryness. They are also a little red and a little bumpy, so I'm guessing I have rosacea? I'm not quite sure since I've always had red cheeks. My mother has also told me that my skin is also sensitive, since I am still quite young and she believes I shouldn't use harsh products on my skin. My mother has tried to help me, but her skin type is largely different from mine (She has oily skin all over). Not really related, but my eyelids and the skin underneath my eyebrows also get oily, so I'm sure what to do about that.

So with all those issues, what skin type do I have exactly? I can't really tell for myself about what skin type I have, so please help me if you can. As for products, I would rather have mainly affordable ones, but possibly a few expensive ones I would be alright with. Additionally, I get busy with homework assignments and other school related things, so if there's a routine that isn't too time consuming, I am willing to try it. Please, if anyone can help me, I would be so grateful for your advice would like to thank you for taking some time out of your day to read my concern.

[Skin Concerns] Desperately need advice on chapped lips,"I've been using chapstick daily for at least 15 years or so.  The last maybe seven years I've adjusted what I'm using since I learned that some brands CAUSE chapped lips so you keep buying their product.  But nothing has ""cured"" it.  I've tried lanolin (made my mouth itch after a while), using straight up coconut or jojoba oil follow by vaseline or the laniege lip mask.  Using aquaphor lip repair, Carmex in the yellow tube, OKeefe's lip tube.  Using a gentle sugar scrub.  Nothing helps the constant cycle of feeling tight and dry and then peeling off.  I try not to pick but I always end up peeling it.

Contributing factors I can think of:

- I work in manufacturing where there is peroxide in the air.  It gets better when I'm away from work for a week but not 100%.  I try to keep ointment on all the time to protect from the peroxide.

- I breathe mainly through my mouth, especially at night.  Even during the day because something about my sinuses makes it so I feel like I don't get enough air if I breathe exclusively through my nose.

- Just years of using chapstick?? IDK.

I use a gentle cream face wash followed by that habolado gel with hyaluronic acid, which I apply on my mouth, too.  I use a high flouride toothpaste which probably contains SLS, but using non-SLS toothpaste never helped.  My skin is probably normal to combo, I haven't decided, and was oily or maybe just dehydrated in my teenage years.

Any advice on other products to try?  Ideally I'd like it to heal enough to not need much but at least stopping the peeling cycle will be great.",1572217972.0,1.0,36

"[Personal] At the end of my rope, my skin is so difficult","I don't know what to do about my skin anymore. The last two or so years I've been dealing with hardcore dryness, redness and sensitivity, to the point where literally everything I use ends up breaking my skin out into red irritated bumps or cystic acne

 It's mostly concentrated on the tops of my cheeks and my nose (my jawline and forehead don't really get affected), so I saw my doctor back in May and she, before referring me to a derm, suggested it could be rosacea and to try a course of metronidazole cream (she also drew blood to see if it was being caused by something autoimmune, which results came back negative for). I used it for 12 weeks, and it worked somewhat well, but halfway through using it it stopped being effective and my skin went back to the way it was. I saw a dermatologist last month who thought it could be my birth control dosage causing hormonal acne, and put me on a low dose of spironolactone for a month to see if it will help. It's done nothing to make a difference, and I'm starting to think it's not my birth control, my skin is just ridiculously sensitive for reasons I can't figure out. I follow up with the derm this week and I think he'll want to up the dosage of the spiro but I doubt it'll do anything. I burst into tears looking at myself in the mirror this morning because my skin is so terrible. It's gotten to the point where coworkers will point it out and ask if I'm okay

I just want to be able to curate a nice routine to take care of my dryness but I can't when everything I use wrecks my skin. Foundation looks horrible no matter how I prep my skin, whereas a few years ago my skin looked amazing without even having to cleanse and moisturize. Even without makeup my skin looks like shit, and feels just as bad, rough and dry

I’m 26 and approaching 27. Am in a highly stressed working environment (and will likely to be for another 2 years or so before I get enough experience and move on). I eat quite healthily, do not smoke and I don’t drink a lot. But I have to sleep late and work under pressure a lot. 

I’ve been thinking about using retinol every night instead of three times a week. I also use vitamin C serum (for the last 6 months) and lots of moisturiser every night. However, I don’t feel like they are doing anything visible yet. 

Should I use a stronger retinol? Is there any other anti aging products / food / routine I can implement for my stressful career?

[acne] Relapsing after years of somewhat clear skin (3 years post-Accutane). Feeling like I will never get rid of it,"Hey everyone,

Three years ago I was on Accutane for 8 months and after that, my skin was so much better. I have struggled with acne since I was 12 (I'm 21 now). It was a life saver and I didn't experience many side effects apart from dry lips and lower back pain. I didn't have to wake up every morning and worry about how bad my acne would be this day. I still had oily skin but it looked healthy. [See pics](https://imgur.com/a/HHQ6YFM). This was last year and those were good days but it shows I had clear skin for a while.

Right now, my skin is pretty much back to where it used to be before I went on Accutane. I don't feel like I have drastically changed my routine. It has changed a bit over the months but my routine right now is pretty much this:

**AM:**

* Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (Even though I have oily skin, my skin doesn't like harsh face washes like the Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser)

* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

* Cetaphil Oil Control Moisturizer with 30 SPF

**PM:**

*  Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser

* The Ordinary Salicylic Acid 2% Solution

* Cerave PM Moisturizer

I have bought a Neutrogena Rapid Clear Spot Gel, which is basically a 5% Benzoyl Peroxide gel and I don't feel like it's doing much but I still use it every now and then. I'm also trying out diluted tea tree oil. (I have used these products before I went on Accutane and they didn't help much back then, I feel like my skin is inflamed and topical products don't help that much). I would love to go back on Accutane because I tolerated it pretty well, the issue is that I had Lasik surgery on my eyes a year ago and they're still very dry and it can be a problem with Accutane.

I have always had a very clear forehead, barely have any pimples there. During puberty, my cheeks were out of control and I still have scars but it's calmed down down. My biggest issue has always been and still is with the **mouth area**. I have stopped using lip balm and swapped toothpaste but it hasn't done anything.

[A few close-ups of my face right now](https://imgur.com/a/CNHkzIL) I mostly have whiteheads and big red bumps that take a while to go away. (see how almost everything is concentrated around my mouth)

Also if used on damp skin it has dimethicone, glycerin and stuff in it so doesn't that basically seal the water into your skin?

[Routine help] What other products should I integrate into my routine?,"

My current routine:


PM
1. Bioderma Attoderm Oil wash
2. TO Niamidacid + Zinc
3. A light face cream mixed by my aesthetician (forgot what she mixed into it, probably B-vitamin, not sure)
4. Akneroxid (benzoyl peroxid) every 2-4 days


AM
1. Plain water or Bioderma wash
2. La Roche-Posay SPF30


Weekly
- TO AHA + BHA
- Sheet mask


My acne-journey started off with big, hurfull inflammations all-over my face (probably hormonal acne) and a very oily skin.


I found out that my skin was dry or combined and seemed oil bc I used very drying face washes. I switched to a more gentle one and started using face cream. In the warmer months I use the above mentioned light textured cream, and in the colder, dryer months I use the la roche-posay sensitive rich face cream.


I also started using benzoyl peroxide around a year ago and it helped getting rid of the hormonal acne. I used to use it every day, now I only use it as a spot treatement when needed.


However, as the big inflammations disapeared, those little bumps started to apear on my forhead and smaller red acne on my face. They are not hurtfull and most of them doesn't have that white ""head"" part. I do get occasionally bigger ones, but the peroxid helps with those. It has no effect on the small bumps thought and I have no idea how to treat them.

[ACNE] Need help with my butt acne,"I've had butt acne for years with no success of eliminating it and now, I've gotten desperate. It affects my daily life, my sex life, it affects my daily activities. As you can see from the pictures, I get these big pimples, that inflame and fking hurt when walking, siting. Eventually they burst, which stain my clothes with blood. They usually appear on butt cheeks and most frequently on an area that connects my butt with my thighs. I don't have acne anywhere else on my body, only on my butt. I also have a lot of scarring from previous pimples. I workout 5-6 times a week.  I live in Europe (for product recommendations)

What kind of products do I use? How do I tackle this? Should I visit a dermathologist? I'm really, really desperate.

[Acne] I actually started caring about my skin and I've gained SO much confidence,"I'm a 19 year old male and up until 6 months ago I've never took care of my skin. I'd constantly pick at spots and scabs and make them bleed, I'd squeeze anything that looks squeezable, just all around did pretty much anything possible to worsen my skin. I met a high school friend for the first time in about 3 months and I'd noticed that his face was super clean. The last time I saw him he had sort of moderate acne but It's not something I've ever thought about until I saw him without it. Kind of made me jealous but also curious of what I could do with my skin, so I started taking care of it.  

I started doing things inconsistently because in the past I've tried a moisturiser, or a face wash, wasn't impressed with the results and stopped doing it. My first things I started doing where washing my face each day - or when I remembered - and I began to use honey as a mask. I saw a little improvement over a month so I went all in and started changing things in every aspect of my life.  All these things below I've done consistently for around 4/5 months and I feel they've all contributed to huge improvement with my skin!  

I washed my face twice a day, with water, when I wake up and before I go to bed. Also about 5 times a week I use a face wash and a face scrub in the shower, and always moisturise afterwards.   

I wash my hands so much more than I used to. Every time I head upstairs in my house or downstairs, I wash my hands. I wash my hands between lessons in college too. 

I started reducing the amount of milk and sugar I drink. I no longer drink sugary/milky coffee/tea, and instead drink them both black. Read alot about dairy causing breakouts and such so I reduced my main intake of dairy. Also, I drink a shit ton of water. Like, 3-4 litres plus every single day.   

I stopped having fast food. I have never been a big fast food eater, maybe once a week at the absolute most and that's usually when I'm with friends - I feel the need to get something to eat with them. Well, I stopped. In 6 months I've had half a pot of KFC popcorn and a chicken breast. That's is, I go out of the way whenever eating with friends to get something organic, or to get fruit or something that is healthy. 

I've stopped touching, scratching and picking at my face. I don't even touch my face really unless I've just washed my hands. I also don't wipe or rub my face with a towel or anything anymore either. I just dab, or hold the towel onto my skin.  

I started exercising a lot more. I do around 4-6 hours of moderately intensive exercise a week. I've included this because I honestly just feel cleaner and fresher when I exercise more.  

6 months or so ago, my neck was riddled with spots, I had super dry flaky skin on my nose, my cheeks were incredibly red, riddled with blackheads and whiteheads and cysts. Similarly just under my mouth, my temples and above my eyebrows. Now I can count two smaller cyst looking things which I pay very little attention to, and one whitehead which comes and goes from time to time on my jawline. I have little to no redness on my face anymore, it's not dry and it's not oily, I couldn't be happier :)",1572177316.0,0.98,9

[Acne] Help with persistent chin acne issues,"I have had persistent chin acne issues for like 3 months now, and it doesn't seem to matter what I do my skin it just won't get better.

[Skin Concerns] My acne is back and it can't be stopped,"Hi guys. I had acne for the most part of my puberty until it finally cleared up this year, thanks to Tretinoin and a consistent routine. My acne came back when I broke out because of either Hada Labo Gokujyun Premium Lotion or Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence, I bought them together and I don't know which of those was the culprit. I stopped using both of them and I haven't touched them again.

 That happened in September and since then, my acne has been coming and going, but I still get lots of new pimples that are painful and also at a part of my face that never was that prone to acne before. I'm still on tret, and I don't want to give up on it, but it doesn't help as much.

 I've considered salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, but there aren't any legit products containing those in my country. Should I try the antibiotic route? Should I go for Azelaic Acid? What do you think would help me that can also be used along with Tretinoin? I really need your opinion!

Thank you!

Note: I've used 10% Azelaic Acid before and it kinda helped, but not as much as tret. If I try it again, I'll get 20% AzA (Skinoren).",1572173569.0,1.0,5

[Haul] Best boyfriend bought treats from Germany! Sensitive/ hormonal acne-prone skin.,"My boyfriend bought me some of my favourite skincare products from Germany ❤️He is the best! First time posting on Reddit, got hooked on the skincare community, want to show some of my favourites and what I know about them:

* **Eucerin Oil Control Cleansing Gel.** I use it every morning and night for acne, it has been great! It gently exfoliates your skin as well, so for someone with sensitive skin it is enough exfoliation with only this product. It contains salicylic acid that is a great ingredient for acne control. It comes with a pump that makes the bacterial contact minimal. Fragrance-free. Gel cleansers like this one are a great option for sensitive skin.
* **Weleda skin food**. Good for everything. I use it as a leave-on mask the day before an event for more glow under my make-up, every night and morning as a lip balm, make-up primer, for dry cuticles, for dry elbows, as night cream in very dry cold weather (I dilute it with a wet Beautyblender), for other dry patches on your body... it is a great multi-use product. The only minus is that is has fragrance, so I don't use it everyday on my skin.
* **La Roche- Posay** **Anthelios** sunscreen 50+. I use it every day. It's good for acne-prone, sensitive skin and under make-up. Fragrance-free.
* **La Roche- Posay** hydrating masks. My favourite masks ever. Very good for sensitive skin, but they do have fragrance in them that is a minus. After a flight (airplanes are drying out the skin a lot) this is a must have!

[Personal] Today my cousin came to me and cried after attempting to whiten her skin," I'm devastated. If you read this story and feel related or you're in the same situation, don't make the same mistake my cousin did.

Today my cousin called me and cried badly. I asked her what's wrong and she told me she fucked up, she couldn't stand looking at herself in the mirror anymore because she thought she looked so hideous. I asked for more details and eventually, she told me about her whitening journey. She lives in Asia, and you know how Asians praise the glass, milky skin. My cousin doesn't have that kind of skin. She loves outdoor activities and she had been in a swimming team for years but she stopped because her classmates were starting to pick on her for her brown skin. She said they wouldn't let her group up with them in the PE class, or they would cut her out of a group selfie. Out of pressure, she hid her parents and decided to buy skin whitening creams sold on the internet by a girl in her school (she's like 15?). She has been using for 4 months and her skin got whitened within 14 days which was insane. She used all her saving money for whitening cream but this month she ran out of money so /fortunately/, she couldn't get it. It made her depressed. One week of not using the cream and now her skin is freaking her out. She showed me photos of her skin and I was shocked.

Her skin right now is so pale you can see so many veins on her skin, it doesn't even look like she has any layers of skin left. The color between her neck and her face is like 8 shades different. There are huge, red, angry pimples all over her cheeks and they look hurt to even touch it. Her eye areas are swollen. She looks nothing like the last time I saw her. Her parents have been thinking it's a bad allergic reaction since she's too afraid to tell them she used all the money for skin-whitening products. She said she wanted to kill herself because now her friends would think she's too ugly and they would start talking about her back again which makes studying harder for her. I hate to see my 14 year old cousin goes through this. She shouldn't have hated her skin, or should feel like she needs a certain skin color to be liked. There should of been no beauty standard that my sister feels obligated to follow.

Please, if you're seeking to whiten your skin color, be wise. Don't risk your skin over some creams being advertised on the internet. If you can, try to love your skin. If you use any social media, don't try to always follow ""influencers"" and feel obligated to follow a certain beauty standard. You're not doing yourself any good.",1572168113.0,0.98,222

I still had a lot of PIH and closed comedones that just won't get any better. Thus, I went down the skincare rabbit hole and came upon a video of Liah Yoo and her Tamanu Oil recommendation. I immediately ordered it. 

I was super excited when I first started using it, hoping to see these ""instant"" results, but nothing seemed to be happening. In fact, my skin seemed to be getting worse and worse. I didn't know what to do. 

Well, since the days have been getting colder, I decided to buy another moisturiser to layer on top of my current one about two weeks ago. Guess what? My skin has seen major improvements within two days of using my new moisturiser. A lot of redness has disappeared, I'm breaking out less, and my PIH is now slowly but surely fading. 

Turns out all of these extra stuff I've been adding to my routine (Adapalene and Tamanu Oil) only get to work their full magic when my skin is not a dehydrated mess. The thing is, I never noticed how dehydrated my skin was until now, but the signs were there all this time. 

So yeah. Do take some time to think if you're experiencing any stagnating progress, tightness, redness, excess oil production, and/or stinging. We might not be moisturising as much as we should be, after all!",1572153998.0,0.63,2
[Skin Concerns] Skin used to be so oily in the T-zone but now is very dry (and flaking) in the T-zone,"I moved north from a country without winter last year. Where I'm from, theres no winter; so my skin is adjusting I bet. But we moved here during the summer which was a nice transition to the cold. When winter last year started, my face started flaking (horribly in my scalp, but a little visible on the face). The summer, my skin is still dry, but flaking is less evident. And now that winter's  about to come, I'm worried it will be bad again.

I put Cerave moisturizing cream (i admit, inconsistently) but that will only last for a few hours. What do you guys recommend?",1572153553.0,1.0,2
[Sun Care] Kose Suncut sunscreens,"I'm currently using Skin Aqua UV moisture gel and love everything about it except for how shiny it makes my face.

The Aqualy is tempting because it comes in a larger pump bottle, but I don't want another shiny sunscreen and have heard that the waterproof is not shiny.

[Routine Help] How to get rid of Face warts?,"Hello all,

Was wanting to post to see if anyone has had any success in removing warts on the face? (think they are warts not sure btw). So I tried an over the counter freeze burn off, compound w freeze off. This one if anyone is wondering. 

[https://www.amazon.com/Compound-Freeze-Wart-Removal-System/dp/B000HM8YCM/ref=sr\_1\_4?crid=1LOKUHFOLFDM4&keywords=compound+w+freeze+off&qid=1572150293&sprefix=compound+w+fr%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.com/Compound-Freeze-Wart-Removal-System/dp/B000HM8YCM/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1LOKUHFOLFDM4&keywords=compound+w+freeze+off&qid=1572150293&sprefix=compound+w+fr%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-4)

&#x200B;

It didnt really do anything to remove the bump as I still have it. When I did apply it, the one on the side of my face did throb at first due to the liquid nitrogen (also the one on my forehead), but all it did was make it throb/burn for half a day, then turn the skin black and fall/peel off a few days later. I thought maybe the wart would have fallen off too but it didnt. I have other pics in my imgur here [https://imgur.com/a/XSOozjr](https://imgur.com/a/XSOozjr) (last one you can see the bump/wart more clearly)

&#x200B;

Is there any product or routine I can try? I just want the bump or wart if thats what it to fall off, want those bumps to bee smooth when my skin grows back. Im currently on a job search so cant go to the dermatologist.

[Acne] La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5?,"hi everyone, 

so i recently read a PIE (post inflammatory erythema.. i think?) thread and people were talking about where your skin is dry and you break out, that’s where you get PIE. and it was like a revelation for me haha! it made so much sense to me! 

when i breakout on my forehead which is oily, there is no mark is left behind. but when i break our on my cheeks there is always a mark and it’s definitely dryer than my cheeks. 

so has anyone tried / would recommend the lrp cicaplast baume for pie? just so i can focus on repairing my skin barrier to hopefully make the redness go away. just for reference, i’ve literally tried every ingredient lol: vit c, azelaic acid, niacinimide, tamanu oil and literally probably everything else. 

any help would be appreciated!",1572149590.0,0.89,6

[Routine Help] Advice on skin care when you work in a cave?,"I (27F) just switched jobs and now work in an underground warehouse that exists in a former limestone mine. It has good ventilation and is food grade but there is still a considerable amount of truck exhaust and general dust. I want a solid barrier between my skin and the free radicals and air pollution.

My current routine is wash my face with only water in the morning, then witch hazel toner, and a light moisturizer with spf. When I get home its a light exfoliating face wash with salicylic acid, followed by nothing or a dab of rose hip oil if I'm feeling dry. If I got very dirty or sweaty I use a coconut oil sugar scrub to really get the grime off followed by nothing but I will leave rinse off the sugar and leave coconut oil on to soak in over night. 

I have been considering Neutrogena hydro boost gel. I've also considered blending a few straight oils (tea tree, vitamin E, jojoba, etc) with my normal rose hip routine. My skin tends to like pretty minimalist products like oils and witch hazel. My skin is typically more on the dry side but I have oily patches from time to time.

Any advice to protect my skin from my new work environment? Spf is not a huge concern as there is no sunlight in the cave but it would be a plus. I just want to up my skin care in general and do preventative aging care as I near my 30s. Acne is not a huge issues either.",1572146506.0,1.0,2

I've never had really bad skin, just normal but pretty consistent breakouts around my chin and the sides of my face. My pimples are mostly just bumps of varying sizes (only the tiny ones really ever turn into white heads), with the occasional underground-er. I also have a bunch of small blackheads on/around my nose and chin. 


I'd love some feedback on my current routine. I'm fairly new to this so I mainly just want to know that I'm using what I should be and in the correct order. I'm mostly looking to clear up my pimples, even out my complexion and bring some life back to my dull-ish skin. And of course, anything anti-aging is a plus!

* Garnier Micellar Water

* TO Hyaluronic Acid *(I haven't used this yet, it just came in the mail today and this is probably where I would slot it in)*

* TO Caffeine Solution

* Sunday Riley C.E.O. Glow Vitamin C + Turmeric

* Pond's Dry Skin Cream *(I hate this but I'm just trying to use it up!)*

* SPF 30 


Night:

* Garnier Micellar Water

* Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser

* Pond's Dry Skin Cream *(As a buffer)*

* Tretinoin .025%

* TO Rose Hip Seed Oil *(Haven't used this yet either, but planning to slot it in here)*

* Origins Drink Up Overnight Mask

[Product Question] Anyone use La Roche Posay Micellar Water?,"I bought a bottle from Ulta instead of my normal BioDerma when I ran out. So far I've used it twice, and I'm on the fence because the LRP feels.. heavier/more oily. Since I'm basically just removing prior skincare products (I wear makeup maybe 5 times per year), I can't really judge the efficiency aspect aside from the fact that it just doesn't give me the same fresh feeling as BioDerma. I'm the same way with cleansing wipes and can only use Shisedo's.. they have this fresh feeling that I've never found in another wipe. Usually they all feel either slimy, oily, soapy or leave some weird indescribable residue.

I always rinse BioDerma off well and will do the same with this bottle, so the texture issue isn't all too big of a deal. I just can't tell which one actually works better lol.

[Routine Help] Suggestions about a new routine,"Okay,  so today I went a little crazy in my local Ulta and bought some The  Ordinary products. I've never used them before, but have heard many a  tale of their benefits. I would say my skin type is combination(leaning a  bit more towards dry), I typically don't break out from products, and  I'm currently on an oral medication (spironolactone) for my acne. My  skin is generally good (minimal breakouts, a tinge of hyperpigmentation  on my nose, and like a bit more dry, but oily in spots) but there are  some things I'd like to improve. I'm hoping with these new products I  can achieve that. So I ended buying the caffeine solution (for dark  circles), the niacinamide (for appearance of pores on/around my nose),  the plant derived squalene (for moisture after cleansing at night) and  the hyaluronic acid (to also work on moisture).

So my proposed regime is:

AM: Cleanse Neutrogena (Hydro Boost),Caffeine solution, then Hyaluronic acid, then moisturizer (clinique) then makeup

PM: Cleanse Neutrogena (Hydro Boost), Plant Squalene & Niacinamide, and moisturizer (clinique)

Is this a good regime to follow, or does anyone have any tweaks to suggest for optimal skin improvement?

[Routine Help] What can I do to improve the appearance of my pores and control my oily skin?,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I need some help with my current routine!

Skin concernes: large visible pores (mainly on cheeks and nose) and generally poor texture, oily skin, congestion, minor but consistant acne and blackheads, and being proactive on the anti-aging front. I will also note that my skin has never been very sensitive to strong products or fragrance. 

Current routine (modified about 7 days ago to include TO products):
AM: Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, TO Buffett, TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, Cerave AM Moisturizer with 30 SPF.

PM: Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, Stridex in the Red Box, TO Buffett, TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, TO Granactive Retanoid 2% Emulsion, Cerave PM.

1 - I now know that I shouldn't be using BHA with the Retanoid. Didn't think anything of it at first but after about 5 days I noticed very very slight warmth, redness and a bit of dryness after finishing my PM routine. I plan to alternate days with the BHA and the Retanoid. Will this provide sufficient exfoliation? Recently I tried oil cleansing/double cleansing with mineral oil followed by my Cerave cleanser and was impressed with the results. Thinking maybe I could add this to my PM routine on nights that I use the Retanoid for a little oomph.

2 - I am not very seasoned in using actives. My previous routine was very basic: cleanse, BHA at night only, then moisturize. My biggest question is on application of multiple actives. The lady at ULTA told me I could mix a few drops of each in my palm and apply them all at once. I have noticed that this has helped with pilling but I'm curious if this method would weaken the effects of each active?

3 - My Cerave AM SPF leaves my skin very greasy and I hate it! Any recommendations on a moisturizer w/ SPF? I would also be open to using a single moisturizer AM and PM then adding an SPF on the morning. Could I do this with the Cerave PM? I am also thinking about trying TO Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA.

4 - I want to try a Rosehip Seed Oil at night, it has been recommended to me by a few people and I have seen some great B&A pictures of people who have similar skin to my own. I'm also curious (for the same ressons) about Thayers Witch Hazel toner but have no idea if it would be helpful, or if I could use it considering my current products? Any suggestions or recommendations on products or my routine would be very appreciated!

I have always been very unhappy with my skin and am finally in a place mentally and money-wise that I can make a real effort to improve it so I'll take all the help I can get!!

+ have a change in ceramides
+ dimethicone seems to be slightly higher up
+ no more hyaluronic acid/seems to be lower (sodium hyaluronate)
+ no more sodium hydroxide

Any more observations anyone? Has anyone else notice the change? I know cerave in the tub is more popular here but anyone use the pm moisturizer? Have you noticed a difference?

[acne] Is there any hope for me? 29 year old male. huge cystic acne. Picture included.,"[https://imgur.com/a/coc4mFt](https://imgur.com/a/coc4mFt)

This is the worst my acne has ever been. I think part of it is I have huge stress at work. I work a mentally straining computer programming job. I moisturize twice a day, was using retin a at night but I probably use it once every 3 days now. I've tried retin A 0.1% for over 2 years. I've tried everything. I'm currently using Cerave baby cream and sometimes  hado lobo premium.

Almost every time after I eat a meal, my face starts to immediately feel oily after. I asked a girl I know who also has some acne if that happens to her, and she said ""no"". The greasier the food I eat, the more my face starts to feel oily after I eat. If I eat a salad it still feels a little oily, but not as much. 

I've been to a naturopath before, I was on gut medication but I was still getting acne. I've done lasers, (photodynamic red light therapy, costed me $900), I've been to Korea and Taiwan to do laser treatments, nothing works. 

Should I try antibiotics, and should it be oral or topical? I heard the oral ones could mess up my gut. Sigh I don't know what to do. I'm 29 years old I shouldn't have to deal with this anymore.",1572120161.0,1.0,16

[Routine Help] Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream dupe / recommendations?,"I have unfortunately gone and gotten myself addicted to the Tatcha Dewy Skin Cream, which I've been using as a daily moisturizer for several months (I don't use it at night because I don't want to mix things on top of tretinoin). I don't have as much cash to spare as I did the last time I bought it... so now I'm looking for cheaper options.

What I love about this product is the sort of ""glossy"" feel after I put it on. It's not what I would call tacky, but it certainly doesn't fully absorb into my skin or dry down. I don't mind it staying slidy because it looks GREAT under makeup; most days I just kinda blend my concealer into it. It doesn't break me out, which is an issue I usually have with creams. The only two moisturizers I've liked before this one were Clinique Moisture Surge (gel formula) and FAB Ultra Repair Face Moisturizer, but they are just not as hydrating as the dewy skin cream.

I am an avid YouTube beauty content consumer but haven't actually spent much time in this sub so sorry if I'm missing some obvious or well-known products!

For context, I guess, the rest of my routine is pretty simple and I'm quite happy with my skin:

Morning: Fresh soy face wash, heavy spritz of Lush tea tree water, dewy skin cream, Farmacy sunscreen

Night: rosehip oil as makeup remover (if I wore makeup that day), Fresh soy face wash, then some combo of tretinoin / clindamycin / niacinamide or half a drop of Drunk Elephant facial oil if I am feeling super dried out",1572118731.0,0.5,6

[Acne] Any advice on what’s on my skin and how to deal with it?,"Here is a link to the picture of my skin: https://m.imgur.com/a/oOCULrE

The area below my lips and around my mouth and on the sides of my nose have these really clustered small bumps over them. They have been there for the past 2 years and while my acne has improved, these bumps on my skin seem to be unaffected. 

The bumps do not hurt at all and they occasionally “flare up” by producing some sort of white secretion but I don’t think it’s pus. You can see it in the picture without flash. 

I have no clue what they are or how to get rid of them but my dermatologist seem to dismiss them whenever I brought it up.

I have struggled with acne for the past 5 years but I have been following this routine since the start of the year (January) when I visited my dermatologist. I was also prescribed Doxycycline 10mg 2 tabs a day for the first 3 months and 1 tab for the next 3 until July before stopping. I’m an 18 year old male.

Morning
1. Cetaphil Cleanser
2. Galderma Benzac Spots Treatment Gel (Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5%) (on active pimples)
3. Neutrogena Combination Skin Oil-Free Moisturizer
4. Innisfree Perfect UV Long Lasting For Oily Skin SPF50+/PA+++

Night
1. Cetaphil Cleanser
2. Galderma Differin (Adapalene 0.1%)
3. Innisfree Green Tea Balancing Lotion EX

My skin is a combination of both dry and oily skin and it’s throughout the year really sensitive too, recently ever since starting my new routine prescribed by my dermatologist who recommended me to still use both active products daily but minimally.

My skin is usually always really oily at the end of the day or whenever I wake up.

I occasionally use toners but I feel that I shouldn’t be using too much on my skin because of how sensitive it can be. 

I have used doxycycline before in the the past few years and while taking it has drastically improved my skin condition, my acne has always returned like right now. I’ll be seeing my dermatologist again at the end of the year but I don’t know what to do in the meantime.

The area around my eyes have been really dried out and really flaky which has lead to my eyes feeling really irritated, red and really painful.

I live in a climate where outside it’s usually always humid while I sleep with air-condition on so it’s much colder and the air is more dry. 

I think I’ve been pretty generous and active when it comes to trying to help my dear skin but it’s honestly very demoralising knowing that it isn’t cooperating.

Thank you for reading this, I would appreciate it anyone could share or give me some advice on how to deal with my acne and those bumps around my mouth area.",1572113904.0,0.5,3

I’m (24F) going to see my GP soon and would like to ask her for a prescription for a topical treatment to help with the frequent breakouts and CCs. As of now, I have a CC that won’t go away - it’s red with a small, baby white head. It’s so aggravating. 

Aggravating because I’ve been on Spironolactone (50 mg) since this late July; however, I went up from 25 mg to 50 mg mid-August, so I guess I’ve used it from that change in dosage (?). Shouldn’t it be working to prevent these? I’m considering asking my doctor to boost my dose to 100 mg - will that help, too? Oh, I’m also on Yasmin as my birth control. 

Reason for these medication regards my PCOS. 

I have combo-dry, sensitive skin. But I do well with acids and whatnot, except salicylic acid, of which burns. 

I’ve seen on many posts - especially, before and afters - the following products used for acne. Could you tell me your experience with one or however many on this list? And how you implement it in your routine? Especially if it’s a retinoid / Tret.

One thing that's confusing me though, since the name has both ""milk"" (like a second step cleanser) and ""oil"" (like a first step cleanser), which cleansing step would it be? Or like their original Cream Skin could it be a hybrid duo cleanser product? :o Just making wide guesses here..

Update: the person who posted it on her story said the post was from a Korean review app and that it will be released in Korea in November.

[Acne] Made the move to Australia and my skin has gone wild,"I've always browsed this sub for skincare ideas and recommendations, but I never thought I would need to come here for help :( I have very oily and acne prone skin, I've been on Accutane 4 times (low doses), with my last treatment starting in February of this year. I had been making a lot of progress on my skin and was dermarolling to get rid of my acne scars. I was honestly feeling so confident in my skin. I lived in a dry cold city in Canada, and almost 2 months ago I made the move to Sydney, Australia. The humidity and heat and big city air has just done a number on my skin. Normally I get cystic acne, which I have still been getting. But I get so many of these small white heads, I even get them on my chest and arms, which I included a picture of. Each morning I wake up with probably 3-4 new white heads. I treat them at night, just for more spots to pop up in the morning. I'm starting to feel so discouraged and upset.

My current routine:

AM

\-vichy normaderm cleansing gel

\- Paula's choice BHA toner

\- Drunk Elephant vitamin c serum

\-Neutrogena ultra sheer sunscreen

PM

\-vichy normaderm cleansing gel with a konjac sponge (I have 2 to let them dry between each use)

\-Garnier micellar cleansing water

\-TO Niancide+ Zinc

\-Cetaphil moisturizer

\-TO Rose hip oil

\- TO salicylic acid to spot treat

\-I also use clay masks throughout the week

Does anyone have any advice who has been through a similar situation? I really thought my skin would have gotten used to this new climate by now. I've also cut down on my sugar and dairy intake to try and help.

[Routine Help] Which products from The Ordinary should/can I use together?,"I ordered some products from The Ordinary and wanted to know which ones I can use together, use AM vs PM, and maybe not use at all together?

I also got Niacinamide + Zinc, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, and “Buffet”.

I believe Niacinamide and MAP can be used together because MAP isn’t quite the same as L-Ascorbic acid/Vitamin C and wouldn’t counteract the Niacinamide, but does anything in “Buffet” interact badly with anything in this?

Finally I got rose hip oil, which I don’t think would change anything. Alternatively, what are some other products I can get from The Ordinary that would work well with another?

[Routine Help] I’m only getting acne and PIH on my left cheek. I’m not sure if my routine is working.,"I used to have mostly clear skin for *years* with dermatologist-prescribed erythromycin, medicated astringent, and RS lotion. Eventually, it stopped working and I broke out like crazy.

Weird thing is, I only get acne on my left cheekbone. Occasionally on the lower parts of my left cheek, but mostly just on the cheekbone area. No, I don’t use my phone on my left cheek; I also don’t sleep on that side. I make sure my hair is always away from my face and my sheets are clean. The acne I get on the left side of my face always turns really red, they always have two heads (either, one bump with two heads or two bumps with a head each right next to each other), and they always leave intense discoloration. I do get acne on other parts of my face, but not as often and they’re a lot milder (just on the surface, goes away quickly, not red and leaves light marks).

I started a new routine 2 weeks ago with clindamycin + benzoyl peroxide (AM/PM daily) and 0.025% tretinoin + 2% hydroquinone (every other PM). It might be too early to judge the effectiveness of this routine, but I’m worried that it’s not working since I still get acne and I don’t see any noticeable difference in my acne marks and inflammation. Also, I don’t know if this is a good thing, but I never experienced peeling/redness/irritation when I use BP and tret on the same day.

Should I continue my routine or should I change it?

**Full routine (oily, acne-prone, moderate acne):**

AM/PM:
- Pond’s Acne Clear facial foam for AM, Pond’s anti-bacterial facial scrub for PM
- Nivea MicellAIR Acne Clear (micellar water)
- Tea tree oil + witch hazel toner
- Benzoyl peroxide gel
- Clindamycin cream
- Celeteque dermoscience moisturizer
- SPF50 sunscreen (AM only)

Every other PM: 0.025% tretinoin + 2% hydroquinone cream (30 minutes wait time before applying moisturizer)

Once a week, PM: sheet mask

Diet changes: cut out dairy and sweets

[Product Question] How to use The Ordinary Vitamin C Powder. It’s so gritty!,"So I wanted a Vitamin C serum that I knew wouldn’t oxidize in the mail in summer or just randomly after time, so I looked at The Ordinary’s Vitamin C powder. I love their price point, and their ingredients are nice, but I’m not sure they’re effective, and they seem pretty inelegant. 

I emailed the company and was told to mix 1/4-1/2 of a scoop full of the powder with 4-5 drops of their Ferulic+Resveratrol serum. Well, I just tried this on the inside of my arm, and it goes on incredibly gritty. The powder doesn’t dissolve completely, and it doesn’t tingle or feel acidic AT ALL. I’m tempted to go buy pH paper tomorrow to see if it’s really acidic. It feels so gritty that I’m not sure that I can wear it during the day under my makeup like I usually do with Vitamin C serums. This was supposed to replace the more expensive Drunk Elephant C-Firma serum. Any idea if I’m just doing this wrong? Does this product actually work?

Also, I can’t use The Ordinary’s Hyaluronic Acid+B5 serum during the day, only at night, bc it pills so badly. I can’t put it on my face while wet bc I use toner. It’s very frustrating. I really wanted to like this company’s products bc they’re so cheap.",1572067450.0,0.66,11

"[Anti-Aging] If epidermis/ dermis thickness is roughly the same depth all over the face, why does the forehead bleed and nowhere else does when microneedling at similar depths?","This is a representation of the findings from \~10 cadavers used to determine precise epidermal/ dermal depths on the face: [https://imgur.com/PpyWj1W](https://imgur.com/PpyWj1W) [https://imgur.com/4vZawZR](https://imgur.com/4vZawZR) [https://imgur.com/qYnqwTU](https://imgur.com/qYnqwTU)

What I want to know is, why does the forehead bleed for me and hurt so much to needle at .5 mm, when the mid-cheek at 1 mm doesn't bleed or hurt (nor does anywhere else outside of the forehead) when it's being needled despite the fact it has essentially the exact same epidermis/ dermis depth profile.

Does subcutaneous tissue somehow buffer pain and bleeding from occurring? And, is the fact that there is none of the aforementioned bleeding outside of the cheek any potential cause for concern re the needling not being effective enough and doing its job?

-You’ve tried a lot. Your exhausted. You have way more important things that life has thrown at you that you’d rather give all your attention to. But instead you can’t escape what is your face that just won’t heal.

Cystic acne is a bitch. It completely takes over your life. Maybe you stopped birth control, moved across country, had a baby. It feels like it came on slow and progressed into what is now never ending and slow healing. People don’t understand why you are insecure. They tell you to drink more water even though you have to pee every hour due to the amount that you do. People say “maybe your doing too much” when really you’ve stuck to your simple 3 step routine for 6 months. Or “your not doing X enough so you need Y” or “just try some vitamins.”

It’s exhausting. Let’s be real. I honestly love SCa bc I have learned so much. And this sub is super supportive. 

I recently tried giving up coffee for a month. It was torture and I had headaches and was a grumpy little lady 90% of the time. My cysts (along my jaw and contoured parts of my cheeks) that I had gotten at the beginning of the month would come back bigger and more inflamed every couple days. By the end of the month I looked in the mirror and realized “well I guess I can drink some coffee today”... I still had every single bump from when I started, plus an extra cluster of CCs and whiteheads everywhere. 

So I started drinking coffee and decided I’d try dairy next.

Milk, since I drink a lot and icecream.
I’m not giving up my cheeses. 

So I did some research and decided on cashew milk (since I know I like almond milk I was like, wait I like cashews more than almonds so maybe I’d like that better)

And it turns out I do. I bought it 5 days ago and have had it with coffee, cereal, smoothies, and with cookies and you know what it’s pretty damn good so yeah, go me.

Anyway, when I went to buy it, i was remembering how much I hated what I called “fake milk” as a child. I was diagnosed lactose intolerant at age 7 and by age 8 I had stomach ulcer removal surgery. I drank lactaid and took Prilosec (I had acid reflux too) until I was about 12/13 when I started staying at friends more and more. And could control more of what I ate. I told my parents I didn’t get stomach aches anymore and when we asked the doctor he said maybe I outgrew it.

I put the cashew milk in my cart and while I’m checking out I look at my boyfriend and go “I’ve been getting stomach aches more recently, I wonder if it’s lactose” and he just looks at me and goes “I mean it doesn’t even sound that crazy”

Fast forward 30 mins and he’s cooking dinner and I’m sitting at the kitchen table googling. And I mean GOOGLING.
I find a lot of articles like these 4:

https://www.healthline.com/health/dairy-and-acne#how-dairy-affects-skin

https://www.quora.com/Can-lactose-intolerance-cause-acne

https://www.sharecare.com/health/lactose-intolerance/children-outgrow-congenital-lactose-intolerance

https://www.romper.com/p/is-lactose-intolerance-something-you-can-grow-out-of-is-it-a-lifelong-sentence-without-cheese-13062482

I’m sitting there like, wait hold the f*** up.

Is it at all possible that I might be lactose intolerant still? I may sound stupid to some but I am 27 years old! 
1.Why would my doctor would tell my parents that, or if he truly just thought that back then. 
2. Why didn’t I think of this before now. If I had a dollar for every time I saw a post on SCa about someone solving their acne by giving up dairy... I’d legit be booking a flight to the Maldives for a month long stay right about now.

Has anyone ever given up dairy and come to this realization or am I the only one?

It’s been 5 days since I started drinking cashew milk and haven’t had icecream. My cysts that haven’t budged in over a month are seriously less inflamed and don’t itch or hurt like they have been. (2 are almost one that I was sure would persist for another couple weeks) 

I’m not getting ahead of myself, I’m just lik “yooo... maybe I’m lactose intolerant still?”
It’s not really my fault considering my stomach has been pretty easy since I was a teen and my doctors legit never said anything again.

Any wisdom, experience, friend of someone with a similar experience, articles, or 2cents are greatly appreciated.

[Routine help] Can these products go together?,"Hey guys! ive heard before you're not supposed to use niacinamide and vitamin c together, but i bought the pixi vitamin C tonic on accident (as opposed to the glycolic acid one, but i also bought the retinol one) and im scared it could cause a bad reaction if i use it along with my cerave moistuirizer (which has niacinamide). i know i could use one in the morning and the other at night, but i moistuirize my face at night too since i take showers at night.

so my question is, can i use both of them together in the same time of the day if i like, use the tonic a couple hours (maybe) before the moistuirizer?? thank u

on a sidenote, im looking into purchasing the ordinary's niacinamide, that one AHA BHA exfoliant (or the salicylic acid one) and maybe the granactive retinoid, would you recommend i get all of these? or do you have any advice on what the ordinary products to get

my current routine is just skincare cosmetics' Retinol Gel cleanser and the Cerave moistuirizer, the one with niacinamide and a little pump. for reference my skin is mixed, sort of acne prone (mostly stress-induced acne and hormonal acne), with some clogged pores and some acne scars/dark spots (which is why im looking into niacinamide lol)

[Product Question] The Ordinary Product Recommendation,"So I'm new to The Ordinary. I almost tried one of their products, but I didn't like the chemicals used. I've since (in a very fierce comment section showdown), found out that their products are pretty safe. So I have 4 items I'm considering:

1. Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5

2. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

3. 100% Plant-Derived Squalane

4. AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution

I'm honestly conflicted about which one to buy (I can only afford 1).

I have oily skin, and I definitely have experience with acids (but I'm not sure as high as 30%). I've used salicylic acid (2%), and glycolic acid in a mask. I don't have sensitive skin, and I've only reacted badly to a product three times (twice was from Clean & Clear, and once was by a cleanser by Seaweed Bath Co.).

In regards to the niacinamide + Zinc, I've heard it works great, but I've also heard some horror stories about it making their skin worse and leaving scars on this app. I really want to buy the right product as the cost is amazing, and since I've started to scale down on the items I use.

I need a product that can provide moisture as I've run out of my moisturizer (it's more expensive than the products above), but I also need a product that can exfoliate and reduce my acne.

1. Is the hyaluronic acid or the Squalane better? The squalane is only ingredient, and also provides moisture. I know hyaluronic acid's efficiency depends on the moisture in the air and whatever moisture in your skin.

2. Is the peeling solution strong? I already use a glycolic mask twice a week at night and since I'm rarely outside for more than a minute, I don't wear sunscreen. Would I have to stop using the mask if I use this, and would I have to wear sunscreen in the morning since this concentration is much higher?",1572052209.0,0.64,11

"[Review] DE T.L.C. Serum, Marula Oil & Saai Makeup Remover| Wrecked my Skin:(","&#x200B;

**Full Product Name(s)**: My skin was giving me some trouble back in August, with some mild acne, uneven tone, mostly around the chin area. I decided to splurge because I was getting really insecure about the situation and picked up Drunk Elephant's T.L.C Framboos Glycolic Night Serum & Marula Oil, as well as the Saai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser. 

**How long I used it**: I stopped using it after 2 weeks.

**Packaging**: Very cute. Love the opaque containers, and the Saai butter packaging is especially cute, with this little spoon thing that has a magnet on it so you can't lose it. Marula Oil dropper felt very fancy. I'm no skincare aficionado and this kind of product line is very ""out of my league"". Loved the outside!!

**Product feel and smell:** The serum doesn't smell like much, a little bit sticky, but gets absorbed pretty quickly. Marula oil is very rich, you only need a little bit. Kind of stays on top of my skin though. The butter cleanser is really hard to get off of your face once it's on there! It's thick and you'll be scrubbing for a little while before that ""butter"" feeling is gone (kind of unpleasant literally like you put a butter stick to your face).

**Postive and Negative effects:** Before anyone tries to gaslight me Drunk Elephant style, as in, claiming the horror story I'm about to tell you had to do with how I was putting it on/when/how often/when I introduced it, etc. I just want to say, look: I was really careful with all of these products. BEFORE adding in these products, I only used La Neige moisturizer & would sometimes (like 2-3 a week if I felt like it) wash my face with Panoxyl (Benzoyl Peroxide). I quit the La Neige in favor of the Marula Oil, and was dedicated to a DE only routine (because that's what all the stuff I read about it said to do). 

But there's no amount of retrograde logic & deflection that justifies the fact that after 7 days of use my skin had developed these boils (welts, even, just these thick things under my skin), and I had never had those. Never. I suppose this is a variant of cystic acne? But it was everywhere. I'm not kidding. My hairline, cheeks, chin, I looked like I had a severe drug problem or something. Even my boyfriend was really concerned for me, and he doesn't really notice stuff like this. At one point I had this massive boil by the part of our face that's close to our ears (day 10), and it became this conglomerate that was also seeping on my scalp. Now I didn't just have horrific acne, and skin that made my ""bad skin"" seem like a long lost dream, I also had a freaking pimple that graduated from a pimple to a freaking baby vulcano??? It was so disgusting. And I'm sorry to whoever is reading this and thinks I'm crazy. But this seriously happened. I then had to figure out what to do. Oh did I mention my face hurt so bad to even move? Like my face was in pain--not burning or tingling--straight up pain. So I get this charcoal tar soap hoping it will help my hair, and I put neosporin on the vulcano. Meanwhile that night, as I'm lying in bed with charcoal smelling hair, it dawned on me.... I was blaming all sorts of things... That I ate some cheese (but I eat cheese every day), or had a soda (I drink soda too), but it was Drunk Elephant. There wasn't going to be an end to the purge. This brand new acne variant that was having fun on my face was a product of their products. So I stopped using them all together. 

**Does it do what it should:** No.

**Overall opinion:** run away if you have skin and you want care for it. 

I have never taken the time to air out my grievances with products until today. Because this is simply the most horrific outcome of a skincare product I have ever experienced, and after scouring the internet for corroborating opinions, I did find many--though buried under the praise. I'm really confused about this brand, and considering the mess it has left me with, and seeing that others have experienced it, I think this really needs some attention. I just don't understand how a product can cause something like this. I have had irritation from things before, or like a little breakout, etc. and then I would know it wasn't for me. But this was a whole new level. Anyone else out here? Can we band together? IDK I'm just so not chill with what happened to my face. I don't even want my money back, I want that Tiffany lady (who I only looked into after all this) to stop saying this is some kind of one-size-fits-all skincare line. If you're going to sell stuff for astronomical amounts of money, I dont give a sh\* about how you think it's your customer's fault for the reaction they're having to your product. NO PRODUCT, especially at this price point, should be able to do this to someone's face within 10 days. Alright sorry for this firey post y'all, this is just, it's therapeutic.",1572046110.0,0.5,7

[Product Question] Adapalene/Differin + Aczone - Concerns with Progress,"Hi y’all - new to reddit but have been following SCA for a while now. 

I was prescribed Adapalene .3% and Aczone about two months ago by a dermatologist for whiteheads and some cystic acne. Here is my progress thus far: \[8 week progress\]([https://imgur.com/gallery/Mt35Ne6](https://imgur.com/gallery/Mt35Ne6)). Sorry for the different lighting in the pictures!

My forehead acne, as you can tell, has cleared significantly and my overall texture and skin feels softer and more even, but I have experienced waves of purging. Like I can’t even tell you what weeks exactly because I feel like different areas purged at different times I know you don’t see the full effects until three months at the least, but at two months, I have experience a new wave of purging on my chin and cheeks. 

It’s possible the wave was caused by other exacerbating factor -  by stress and midterms (I go to a very difficult university), being sick for the past week, PMS, and not eating as well as I do because all the listed factors.

Would love advice for hyperpigmentation (I’ve always had hyperpigmentation issues everywhere on my body fml) and how to manage the purges/if I should keep using Adapalene + Aczone! Product recs would be appreciated.

I’m an AWFUL picker and squeezer but have tried my best not to be. My diet, until this past week, is pretty well rounded, mostly organic - fruits, veggies, carbs (unfortunately lots of pasta) and meat. I work at least 3-4 times a week. 

Skin Type: Sensitive and Combo - prone to flakiness on the noses. Prone to hyperpigmentation and scabs take forever to heal.

Here is my current skincare routine:

AM:

\- Wash face with Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser 

\- Aczone on affected areas 

\- Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream - Extra Dry Skin

\- Pure and Clear Neutrogena Baby Sunscreen (every sunscreen I have ever tried - Elta MD, Sheseido, La Roche Posay, etc. has caused me to breakout more since I have pretty sensitive skin) 

I wear makeup everyday - foundation: Bareminerals Original Powder (I wash my brush weekly) 


PM:

\- Double cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water and wash with Vanicream Cleansee 

\- wait to dry for at least 3 minutes - combine Aczone and Adapalene and pat into face 

\- Apply hydro boost again

\- Started incorporating Cerave Healing Ointment on drier areas now that’s it getting colder in DC. I tried Aquaphor, and it didn’t do much. 

\- I’ll put on hydrocolloid bandaids on areas that are more inflamed after washing and before rest of skincare routine. While it flattens the pimple, I feel like I get pretty bad PIE.

[Personal] How changing my diet cleared my skin after struggling with acne for 10 years,"Hi! I've never posted here before but after reading so many threads about diet and acne I thought I would share my experience :)

I’m a 19 year old female who has been struggling with hormonal acne consistently for 10 years, although it has varied from moderate to severe. Like many others I have tried what feels like every topical treatment and medication (except Accutane because I have heard so many stories about its negative long term effects) and became familiar with the cycle of getting my hopes up only to be let down when these products did nothing for my skin. Unfortunately I don’t have any photos from when my acne was at its worst because I avoided photos in general but I have very oily, acne prone skin and generally broke about all over my cheeks, jawline and chin with quite large painful whiteheads and at times cysts.

Earlier this year I decided to cut dairy out of my diet after doing a bit of research, and for the first 3 months I managed to cut out 80-85% of it from my diet. Before this I had been drinking around 1-2 cups of skim milk per day and ate cheese regularly so I expected to notice a quick change in my skin but not much happened. At the 3 month mark I cut out 100% of dairy and also cut out foods with a high glycemic index, especially white bread, white rice and potatoes. After about a week of this new acne stopped appearing and I was thrilled - this was the first time since I was nine that I had not had active acne on my face for longer than a couple of days. 

After a few weeks I started to snack on sorbet, macarons and dairy-free biscuits, which are obviously high in sugar and while I didn’t break out immediately, in the following weeks I got a couple of small cyst like pimples that were very painful and inflamed, as well as several whiteheads. Following this I cut out added sugars (which for me was mostly fruit juices, sugary muesli/granola bars and breakfast cereals) and maintained a dairy free, low GI diet. I am aware that combining high GI foods with low GI foods in one meal will prevent your blood sugar levels from spiking but I avoided them anyway because I wanted to see what kinds of effects my new diet would have.

At the time I am writing this it has been about 6 weeks since I cut these foods out and my skin has never been clearer. I have had a couple of tiny whiteheads around my jawline which are not painful and tend to disappear after a day or two, but otherwise nothing. I know 6 weeks is not the longest amount of time but I have never seen such a positive change in my skin so I finally feel like I must be doing something right :)

I’m not sure whether anyone else who has had acne for ages can relate to this but it's crazy how having clearer skin can make you feel totally different - when people look at me I’m not just thinking about how they’re looking noticing my acne and nothing else, and when I look in the mirror now I feel like I can see a face instead of just seeing acne. While cutting out a few things (i.e. potatoes in all their forms) has been a struggle, I am adjusting to my new eating habits and might start re-introducing a couple of things back into my diet one by one to try and find out exactly what has been causing my acne.

Routine:

\*Disclaimer: unfortunately in all my years of having acne no product I have used has ever drastically improved my skin but my current routine seems to at least be maintaining my clear skin :)

AM:

* Phisohex cleanser
* The Ordinary Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% (only started this some weeks ago but it has already helped fade some of my scarring)
* usually Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel but Sukin Organic Rosehip Oil in very cold weather as my skin tends to dry out a bit
* La Roche Posay Anthelios XL SPF 50+ Ultra-Light Fluid

PM:

* Phisohex cleanser
* The Ordinary Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2%
* Sukin Organic Rosehip Oil
* Spot treatments: Epiduo for whiteheads (not incredibly effective) or Mario Badescu Buffering Lotion for cystic acne 

1-2 times a week: Pixi Glow Tonic (if I use this in the AM I make sure I don't use Ascorbic Acid until the PM and vice versa)

3-4 times a week: Pixi Rose Tonic 

I never thought I would be making a post about how I cleared my skin, so if you have made it this far thank you so much for reading!! Please let me know if you have had any similar experiences/have any questions/if you would like a more detailed list of what foods I avoid to help maintain my skin :)

[Skin Concerns] Help with scarring due to Tretinoin purge.,"Hi SCA, i've been having some Tretinoin purge, my face looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/PTxK7Sg) two weeks ago.

Things are getting better though, it seems that no more pimples are coming out, at least for now, but now my face is very scarred, like never before, especially on my forehead and the right side of my face, [this](https://imgur.com/a/S0v4xyD) is my face today.

&#x200B;

I guess it looks ok considering two weeks ago i was breaking out real bad, but if possible, i would like to use something to get rid of the scars faster.

&#x200B;

My routine is:

**AM**

* Cerave hydrating facial cleanser for normal to dry skin.
* Cerave moisturizing lotion for dry to very dry skin.
* Local brand sunscreen 50+ FPS UVA-UVB

**PM**

* Cerave hydrating facial cleanser for normal to dry skin.
* A mixture of Tretinoin 0.5% and Cerave moisturizing lotion for dry to very dry skin.
* Local brand hydrating sleep mask.

&#x200B;

What would you experts recommend? Also, i tend to get a lot of irritation on my face after shaving, i shave with Gillete Mach 3 sensitive Razors and i use Gillete sensitive shaving cream, but i still get some red bumps. I used to get a lot of irritation before because i used normal Gillete razors, but since i changed to the sensitive brand, it got a lot better, but sometimes is still a problem.

Anyways, thanks for reading the post, looking forward to your answers and have a good day.

[Haul] Testimonial: Skin care regime making a difference to someone I love :-),"As I was reading through this Reddit community (I'm new to this community by the way), it reminded me of my boyfriend who just recently got into a skin care routine. A month or two ago, I made him change out his entire skin care procedure because he's only been using body lotion for everything... which I found ridiculous. Here, I thought I'd share the products that he's changed to, to possibly influence some guys in this community!

So if any guys need some tips... continue reading below :-)

**Skin history/issues/type:**  
• Moderate to severe facial acne and now boxcar scars on malar cheeks  
• Mild (black) comedones on nose  
• Semi-oily t-zone, resulting in combination skin

**Diet/Lifestyle:**  
• Fast food a couple times a week (which isn't great, but he can't do much about it in his situation)  
• Cooked food daily (a healthy balance in carbs, veggies, and protein)  
• Not much sugar and sodium intake (he doesn't really like sugar)  
• A hefty amount of water a day (11-15 cups/day)  
• Works out a couple of times/week• Little to no humidity with intense sun in his location  
• Uses a Fitbit to count his steps... lol

**Before:**  
• Some random body lotion... I don't even know what it was. He's used this on his face too, only after showering  
• Dove body soap  
• No sunscreen at all  
• Hot water for showering

**After (aka, the ""Haul""):**  
• Still uses Dove body soap. I told him that any soap that makes you feel ""squeaky clean"" will only dry out your skin so he's sticking with Dove! He's also lowered the temperature of his shower water  
• *CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion* (aw yeah that giant tub of goodnesssss)  
• *Elta MD Sport Broad SPF 50 Sunscreen* (He has sunscreen allergy!! I found that out by using Neutrogena sunscreen at the beach. I remembered that the dermatologist that I used to work under always recommended this sunscreen and so I made him get this one. He uses it daily, or at least I make him, and it is effective!)  
• [Philosophy Purity Made Simple Cleanser](https://www.sephora.com/product/purity-made-simple-P7109?icid2=products%20grid:p7109) switching back and forth with *CeraVe Hydrating Cleanse**r* (both cleansers have been very gentle to his skin and non-drying)

• [InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner](https://www.amazon.com/InstaNatural-Vitamin-Facial-Toner-Moisturizers/dp/B00NLKAVL4) (Great for dry to combo skin, right after cleansing. Also contains witch hazel, which is supplemental for those with acne/rosacea.)  
• [Innisfree Green Tea Serum](https://us.innisfree.com/products/intensive-hydrating-serum-with-green-tea-seed) (I highly recommend this as it is light on the skin and good for any type of skin. They're also available at Sephora)  
• [Innisfree brightening and pore-caring cream](https://us.innisfree.com/collections/tangerine/products/brightening-pore-caring-cream) (only for face. Innisfree's brightening and pore-caring tangerine products have Vitamin C, resulting in a brightening touch)  
• [Innisfree pore-caring sleeping mask](https://us.innisfree.com/collections/tangerine/products/brightening-pore-caring-sleeping-mask) (2x/week to keep the moisture intact)  
• [Biore deep cleansing pore strips](https://www.amazon.com/Bior%C3%A9-Deep-Cleansing-Strips-Count/dp/B0009EILKS/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=biore+nose&qid=1572031129&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTjhIMDlFQjhROE0xJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTgwNjc1MjRYMEVJQ0dXU1lXRyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTEyNzc0MkpLWlhGOFg0S0NSOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) (I personally use these for my whiteheads and they're super effective! He uses these once in a while... he hates this haha)

**AM Routine (in order):**  
• Cleanser  
• Toner  
• Serum  
• Sunscreen (reapplying throughout the day)

**PM Routine (in order, no mask application):**  
• Shower  
• Moisturizer (CeraVe)  
• Cleanser  
• Toner  
• Serum  
• Facial Cream (Innisfree)

◘ If he uses a sleeping mask, he only applies up to the toner, puts on the sleeping mask, sleeps, wakes up and goes forward with the AM Routine.  
◘ If he uses the pore strip, he adds that in between the toner and serum steps.

**Results/Overall:**

I only see him once a week and after 2-3 weeks, I've noticed that his face is now a lot more moisturized, his pores definitely reduced in size (they used to be a lot larger, especially around his scars), and his face looks A LOT more evened out in tone and texture! So amazing. He's also told me that his co-workers noticed a huge difference in his skin and he's been obsessed with skin care ever since! It's so great to get someone into skin care :-) It's not too late!

About his diet: He did not change his diet at all, meaning that his diet didn't affect his skin as much as we thought because he hasn't been eating super unhealthy all the time.

All in all, I just want to point out that **consistency is key** with skin care and **finding the right products for your skin takes time** (and unfortunately money but), and definitely **research**. These products have chemicals of different pH in them so it's your job to find out what products mix in well in your skin care regime! It is certainly rewarding in doing so.

[Product Question] Desperately need advice on pimple patches for my sister!,"My sister recently has had a random breakout on her face that consists of about 5 pimples on her face that are pretty large, she hasn’t touched them so now all the pus is at the surface and very big and white, she’s been trying all week to get them to pop on their own and go down but instead today she woke up with a new one. We have a sweet 16 tomorrow and she’s very stressed about them, nothing that usually works for me to clear up my acne has helped her. I’ve never used pimple patches but I’ve heard of them really helping with pimples overnight so my question is, should she pop them and use the patch or just put the patch right on them unpopped, they are extremely ready to go but just haven’t, I usually pop mine and clean them out and dry them out but my mom told my sister not to pop them afraid that it’ll scar her cause they’re big. Any other help on how to get rid of these or at least severely minimize them for tomorrow would be amazing, I hate seeing her so upset.

[B&A] One Year; thanks everyone!," It's been a little over a year since I joined this subreddit and my skin has changed for the better. I didn't realize how much until I saw these pictures. My skin looks so much more glowy and healthy, even if some of my more stubborn bumps and scars persist. ([Now](https://imgur.com/a/HktpO5u)) A year ago, I had a lot more redness, oil, and irritation from using bad products. ([Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/a/726TFRU), [Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/a/uLFRM69))

I have combination skin that's oily in the t-zone and dry in my cheek area. I get hormonal acne, but I'm more prone to clogged pores, blackheads, and generally awful skin texture. I'm still dealing with that, and I don't like my scarring, skin texture, or giant nose pores, but keeping my skin hydrated and moisturized has cut down on the oiliness and irritation. Less Instantpot and more Instagram.

Currently my main concerns are finding a cruelty-free, low-waste routine, improving skin texture, and keeping skin hydrated. Gotta save the water on my face as much as the water in the environment.

Current Routine

AM

1. Cleanse with water.
2. Apply TO HA.
3. Apply TO Squalane if I'm feeling dry.
4. Apply PURITO Centella Green Level Unscented Sun once the squalane has sunk in.

PM

1. Oil cleanse with Jojoba and wipe clean with a soft microfiber cloth.
2. Cleanse with Derma-e Sensitive Skin Cleanser.
3. Apply PC 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant or COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid depending on the day.
4. After waiting 20 minutes, dampen face and apply TO HA.
5. Apply TO Squalane.
6. If face is very dry, apply Ceramedx Moisturizing Body Lotion to dry areas.

Weekly

1. Apply Aztec Healing Clay Mask mixed with ACV.
2. Apply Derma-e AHA Overnight Peel.
3. Wash makeup brushes.

My skincare journey radically changed when I went vegan May of this year. I wanted to switch my skincare as well, but as a member of the Church of All the Allergies, all that hippy-dippy, essential oil, fragrance-having heresy was not going to fly. When my beloved CeraVe bit the dust I knew I couldn't repurchase it, and I stumbled on Peet Rivko. It's great as long as coconut-derived ingredients jive with you. Not so great if you love your wallet. I used my travel sizes up, cried, said a prayer to the hippie skincare Gods for mercy, and stumbled upon Derma-e's cleanser. I love it, and it's affordable.

I'm still nailing down my products, but I have a much better idea of what to avoid and what works for me. I cut out dairy for close to a month before I went fully vegan, and saw a drastic change in my skin. It may not work for everyone, but it did for me. I stopped using foaming cleansers altogether, and while I'm not opposed to plant extracts and additives, I'm much more careful about them. I avoid fragrance almost entirely. The biggest challenge was wearing sunscreen every day. This was never something I was taught to do, but I'm proud of myself for sticking with it. I also wash my makeup brushes, towels, and sheets on a weekly basis to keep everything clean.

I've been working with my doctors to manage my disability and depression. It's going to take a while but being a part of this sub has helped me realize that I am not an ugly monster, skin texture is normal, and its okay to take time for me and take care of myself. My ex-boyfriend constantly made comments about my weight when I gained a few pounds on birth control, and my self-confidence dropped. I started nitpicking every little flaw, and honestly if it weren't for seeing real-life photos of you wonderful people, I don't know if I'd have snapped out of that.

Thanks, SCA. I know my skin isn’t perfect, but I’m proud of it and I just wanted to share with everyone!",1572029003.0,1.0,2
[misc] The Ordinary products feel tacky/sticky as they dry?,"Hi everyone,

I have tried a few TO products, namely Alpha Arbutin 2%, Lactic Acid 5% and Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%. I have never used them more than a couple times, because every time I do, they feel super sticky afterwards, and feels like my skin can't breathe (as if under plastic wrap). I usually freak out and want to wash it off. I haven't had any adverse effects, no breakouts on them or anything, but no benefits either, because I'm too scared to keep using them.

My main questions is, first of all, is this tackiness/stickiness normal? And second of all, if it is, does it eventually get absorbed and stop feeling sticky? 

I feel like my aversion to that tacky feeling is from using cheap acne stuff when I was younger, that made me break out even worse because my skin is so reactive.",1572028431.0,0.4,6

I’ve been using Dove bar soap for about 20 years without incident. In frugal times, I even use it to lather up to shave underarms! But for the past few months, I’ve been stepping out of the shower with a mild rash on my face, arms and legs. It looks like a heat rash (and skin feels hot), but I always shower in fairly cold water. I tried switching out the Beauty bar/original white for the Sensitive Skin version, and get the same result.

[Acne] Deep painful little whiteheads along the lip line,"Hey all,

Anyone else struggle horribly with getting really deep painful little pimples right along the lip line and/or in the corners of the mouth? I've got the acne on my face generally under control at this point but it's these concentrated little pain nuggets right along the lip that are just the worst. My lips have been getting really dry especially with the change of weather lately but anything I use on them seems to cause/worsen these lil' painful buggers at the edges of my lips. :( Vaseline almost seems to be the worst as not only does it cause the lip line pimples but I also seem to get nasty massive canker sores on the inside of my lower lip whenever I use it for a while :/ Generic oil/beeswax type lip balms don't seem to do much even when I use a plain HA serum on my lips first and also contribute to the lip line pimples. It's extremely irksome. I know some people say toothpaste is a cause but I already use sulfate free toothpaste, and I don't get them constantly, more so just when I'm using anything that keeps my lips from getting dry, but I don't like my lips constantly flaking and cracking either!

Any advice on how to deal with this? Both getting rid of these pimples fast because they hurt and if they get too deep they can cause my whole lip to swell, as well as preventing their return.",1572021221.0,0.67,2

Is there anything I can do to get rid of it fast?

P.s I have tried lemon juice for 2 weeks and have not seen much difference.
    Thanks for the help 😊",1571999090.0,0.4,6
"[routine help] I think I have figured it out! Dry, sensitive skin, acne prone with eczema.","Hey all!

I just wanted to share my routine, because I think I have finally figured it out. I have very sensitive skin, with both acne (mild/moderate) and eczema. I live in a country with dry, cold winters, which always triggers my eczema.

I have the last 6-8 months been experimenting trying to get a solid routine. This is what I have been using the last couple of months, and I really feel its working, not triggering the acne nor the eczema . Everything is over the counter products (in Europe).

&#x200B;

**AM**:

\- Rinse with water or Ceraves hydrating cleanser.

\-  Gardens of Wisdoms azelaic acid 10%

\-  La Roche-Posay Toleraine Sensitive riche cream in winter (and the normal one in the summer)

\-  ROHTO Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk SPF 50+++

&#x200B;

**PM:**

\- Rinse with water or Ceraves hydrating cleanser.

\- benzoyl peroxide 5% all over the face for about 10-15 minutes before rinsing it off. (started with 3-5 minutes)

\-  Gardens of Wisdoms azelaic acid 10% (sometimes I skip this if I feel my skin needs a break).

\-  La Roche-Posay Toleraine Sensitive riche cream in winter (and the normal one in the summer)

&#x200B;

I really feel the combination of benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid is the key here (and of course finding a moisturizer that works for me).

I have worked my way up with the products. In the beginning only using AA every onther day. Then only using BP in the evenings and AA in the mornings. Im gonna continue with this, hopefully usng AA and BP together both mornings and nights, and maybe switching to BP 10%. It is really important for my skin that I rinse the BP off (for now anyways) because it is way too sensitive to leave it on over night.

&#x200B;

Hope this can help someone! <3

And if someone with similar skin conditions have any other experiences, please share!

"[Routine Help] Need some advice building a The Ordinary routine for acne prevention, skin brightening, and lightening dark spots. Overwhelmed with all the choices.","I'm going to soon be running out of a few of the major players in my skincare routine, and instead of repurchasing them, I'd like to get some products from The Ordinary. As the title says, I'm primarily interested in preventing acne outbreaks (I tend to get them around the time of my period, stressful times, and when I have bad eating habits) as well as lightening dark acne spots that I've had for a while and keeping my complexion bright.

I have combination skin. Sometimes (depending on the weather and heat) it can be dry, other times very oily. For most of the year, I tend to have an oily T-zone.

So far I own three TO products: Glycolic toning solution, Niacinamide + Zinc, AHA + BHA peeling solution.

**Current AM Routine**

\-Rinse face with water.

\-Apply toner, currently using I'm From Rice Toner.

\-Apply vitamin c serum. Currently using the Farmacy Very Cherry Brightening Serum. This is one of the products I'm about to run out of. I've been using it for about a month and a half now. I like the product, but am not sure if I should get another bottle to see if this is really an effective serum or if I should go back to using an l-ascorbic acid serum, since I know those are more potent.

\-Apply sunscreen. Currently it's the Drunk Elephant SPF 30.

As far as skincare goes, that's it. I wear makeup almost every day.

**Current PM Routine**

\-Cleanse. Right now I double cleanse, first using the Dear, Klairs Gentle Deep Black Cleansing Oil and follow it up with the Pixi Rose Cream Cleanser. Twice a week, instead of using the Pixi cleanser, I use Murad's AHA/BHA exfoliating cleanser.

\-Use a wash-off mask. I currently have 9 different ones that I use on rotation. Some of them I use primarily for pampering purposes. The two strongest ones are Drunk Elephant's Sukari Babyfacial and The Ordinary's AHA + BHA Peeling Solution. I apply each of those once a week, with 2-3 days between them, and I usually don't apply them on days when I cleanse with the Murad AHA/BHA cleanser because I get the feeling it would be too much on my skin. If I'm not applying one of those two, I use one of the following:  I'm From Honey Mask, I'm From Vitamin Tree Mask, I'm From Mugwort Mask, I'm From Ginseng Mask, I'm From Volcanic Mask, Farmacy Honey Potion, and Generation Clay Ultraviolet Brightening Mask.

\-On nights when I've used the Drunk Elephant or TO masks, I will then apply my I'm From Rice Toner, then follow that up with the I'm From Mugwort Essence. On nights when I've used gentler masks, I follow up with my TO Glycolic Acid Toning solution, wait at least 20 minutes and then follow that up with the Mugwort Essence.

\-Next, on most nights (and definitely on nights when I use the Drunk Elephant or TO masks) I apply my TO Niacinamide + Zinc solution. Two or three times a week, instead of applying niacinamide, I use Drunk Elephant's Glycolic Night Serum.

\-Finally, apply moisturizer. These days I'm mostly using either I'm From Vitamin Tree Water Gel or I'm From Mugwort Cream. Sometimes I'll use Purlisse's Matcha Green Tea Moisturizer.

&#x200B;

The products I'm going to be running out of soon are my Farmacy vitamin c serum, my DE Glycolic Night Serum, and my TO Niacinamide. I'd like to continue with the niacinamide. The main difference I've noticed so far is a reduction in my skin's oiliness in the morning. Over the past two days, I've finally started to see my hyperpigmentation looking lighter.

A lot of TO's products claim to help with lightening dark spots and keeping the skin bright, so I'm not sure which I should go with since there are so many options.",1571989398.0,0.5,4

I found my holy grail next to the orange chicken: a skincare love story [personal],"Tl;dr, go to Trader Joe’s, their ultra hydrating gel moisturizer is better than neutrogena hydro boost gel and costs 9 dollars. If you wanna know way too much about my life, have fun with this nonsense, and I’m sorry in advance!

I’ve never had great skin. For most of my life, my skin has been fine. Just fine. Never got a “oh my gosh you have amazing skin” from a drunk girl in a bathroom, no one has ever told me that I look glowy. I always had closed comedones, but not so many that they were horrific or really really bothered me. I washed my face only in the shower, with whatever I picked up at the drugstore that said “for oily skin”. I occasionally got a pimple, but usually just slapped some spot treatment on it and it usually vanished in a few days. Moisturized when i remembered to (so like every 5 days or so). My skin was fine. And then came the Breakup. 

The Breakup happened around three months ago, and it was (and sometimes still is) fucking awful. He was the first guy I ever really, truly loved, and who made me feel truly loved. In the end, we just weren’t right for each other. But the way it ended was fucking awful (mostly on his part honestly). And as soon as it happened, my skin went fucking psycho. Giant, bright red pimples all over my forehead, weird tiny red ones on my chin, random super dry scaly patches between and underneath my eyebrows; plus acne all over my shoulders! Because that’s what I needed as a freshly dumped 19 year old. 

I made an emergency appointment with my little brother’s derm and poured my soul out to the poor nurse assisting her, with her gorgeous face and her perfect skin and her engagement ring. The derm prescribed me doxycycline, epiduo for my face, and clindamyacin lotion for my shoulders and told me to find a good moisturizer. And thus came my intro to SCA. 

Holy fuck you guys love moisturizer. After a little bit of browsing, I figured I should probably set about finding a basic one with hyaluronic acid in it, so I started with the neutrogena hydrogel and liked it a lot! It really helped my skin, kept me from getting too dry on the epiduo, and was generally good. But I really wanted something that was similar, but had less fragrance and no color, two things I’m really sensitive to. 

And then I found it. In Trader Joe’s, while buying toffee covered pretzels, brie, and dried juicy mandarin oranges (yes those are my go to sadness foods. no i will not be judged). The Ultra Hydrating Gel Moisturizer, with aloe and green tea extract. Holy shit. Not only does it have hyaluronic acid, aloe, and is fragrance and dye free, but it’s 9 dollars. NINE DOLLARS. My skin has never felt smoother or more hydrated in my life. I’m obsessed. I’m shouting it from the hilltops. GO TO TRADER JOES. THEY WEIRDLY MAKE REALLY GOOD FACE MOISTURIZER. My skin now looks so good and so much better than even before the Breakup happened that my ex tried to get back with me last week, and said I looked really good when he did it. I didn’t have any makeup on. But now I know my worth, and I told him no. Thank you, moisturizer.",1571985709.0,0.93,19

"[Skin Concerns] I've been doing my skincare for about 4-5 months now with some changes, but I still so lost.","So I've been taking care of my skin for a while, at first it was working pretty well my forehead looked cleared, though I still got random large whiteheads on my face....I continued modifying and changing things (taking off any melted sunscreen, changing pillow cases more frequently, etc.) And about a month ago I was doing my skincare, but whenever I put moisturizer one, I noticed that it would burn (and thus realizing that I was previously damaging my skin's moisture barrier). So for about a week I avoided applying any aha's to my skin and then slowly added them back in...however my skin looks glowy but the texture of my skin is still iffy and I still get random pimples (primarily on my cheeks) and little tiny bumps on my forehead. I'm so frustrated and I don't know what to do. Especially since I am a dark skin woman, and thus every time I get a pimple, it leaves a dark mark, and honestly I've become a little self conscious having to look in the mirror twice a day without any improvement. Should I just drop my entire skincare routine for a month and only wash my face and moisture it? Does anyone have or have had similar skin issues as me?

I have acne-prone combination skin, my cheeks get really dry and t-zone is a little oily, but my nose can get very oily)

Here is my current skincare routine:

**AM**

\- Either wash face with water or wipe gentle with micellular water

\- Kikumasamune Sake Loition, (about 3 times)

\- Cosrx galactomyces 95 whitening power essence

\- (sometimes) Hada Labo Premium

\- either the Cerave moisturizing cream or the Eucerin 5% Urea Cream (in winter I sometimes add the Stratia Liquid Gold -- Michigan is hella dry in winter)

&#x200B;

**PM**

\- Kose Speedy Cleansing Oil

\-  Vanicream Cleanser

\- Stratia Soft Touch AHA (2x per week), (1x per week) Cosrx Whitehead Power Liquid - Question: Should I be using a bha? It's just that I dont get blackheads ever), I also wait about 10-15 minutes for it to fully absorb while lightly spritizing my face with water.

\- Kikumasamune Sake Lotion

\-Hada Labo Premium

\- Eucerin 10% Lotion + Stratia Liquid Gold (another question: can thick creams be causing the pimples? But I don't think so since I also do this to my nose, and there have been no pimples popping out? But the light white dots of pores...is that normal?

[Personal] Extremely disappointed with acne scar treatments...anyone else?,"I had moderate acne when I was in high school. I really didn't think it was a big deal, as mine wasn't particularly bad and most kids my age had it. I was also really focused on doing well that I wasn't really paying attention to it. Unfortunately, when my acne cleared up, I was left with a ton of atrophic pitted scars. I've been trying to get rid of my scars for about 3 years now, and I'm really disappointed. I've tried fillers, lasers, subcision, and microneedling, and if I'm being generous I've seen maybe 15% improvement after spending a little over $5000. The dermatologists I've seen don't seem to really care, they just view it as an opportunity to make money and sell me package deals. I've done a lot of research and it seems a lot of these treatments are based on flimsy studies rather than any rigorous testing (Most of these studies show pictures to other dermatologists to measure improvement, when acne scars can be invisible in the right lighting and angle, instead of actually analyzing scarring or the histology of the skin. And that's not even considering things like post treatment swelling). It's really hard when your insecurities are on your face, as you can't hide the at all. I've had severe body dysmorphia as a result of this, when I never had any issues with my appearance before. I'm just not sure what to do and it seems so strange that I'm stuck with these scars for the rest of my life. It just seems so odd because you can change almost everything about your appearance nowadays, your hair color, your weight, plastic surgery, etc, yet we can't fix 2 mm indentations in the skin. Anyways sorry for rambling I just feel like I'm missing out on what should be the best time of my life.

[Personal] 2019: The year my skin went cray,"In early 2019, I had the best skin of my life. My face looked fair, with no PIE. I was not having any breakouts. And my skin was not flaking (I have very dry skin). I attribute it to a couple factors. 1. I was working out almost every day (sweating out that dirt). 2. I started and maintained a simple and consistent skincare regimen. And 3. I was on birth control. I was feeling so confident in my skin, that I was even going out (yes! In public!) without any makeup on.   

My regimen was:  

AM  
- TO Buffet
- Origins Ginzing Moisturizer
- Origins Depuff Eye Cream
- Supergoop Sunscreen 40spf

PM
- Fresh Soy Face Cleanser
- TO Buffet
- Fresh Lotus Night Cream
- TO Rose Hip Seed Oil (2-3x week)

Shower only
- Origins White Tea Cleanser

Then in the spring, my doctor took me off BC due to some medical issues I was having at the time. I was freaking out. I had been taking BC for over 8 years, and was terrified about how my body would react to the change. The first month went by and I didn’t notice any changes (other than my boobs getting smaller ☹️). But then in month 2, I got my first period after quitting BC and all hell broke loose. I started getting acne all over my face, mainly concentrating on my chin and around my mouth.  

This continued throughout the summer. I decided to add some new skincare products to my regimen and see if that would help. Not gonna lie, seeing all the products mentioned on here was tempting me to try new things even more. 

Over the summer, I added some items to my PM routine:
- Drunk Elephant 1% Retinol Cream (2x week)
- Skin & Co Truffle Therapy Face Toner
- Caudalie Instant Foam Cleanser  

After I added these to my routine, I noticed my acne started to change from whiteheads in my chin/mouth area to deep, painful cysts around my jaw and temple. I never have had acne like this before. I didn’t even think getting acne on my neck was possible! 

In September, my doctor gave me the green light to go back on BC and I jumped on the chance. I thought this would fix all my skin problems. I decided to remove the Caudalie cleanser and Skin & Co toner - I thought they were possibly drying my skin out more and causing some of the acne. I wanted to go back to my original routine, and keep the DE Retinol Cream (cause I was enjoying that). 

It’s been almost two months since I went back on BC and my skin has not improved. I’ve gotten a string of cysts along my jawline. Some have disappeared but they have left horrible PIE. I also have not been able to get rid of the acne on my temple, and I’ve been getting breakouts on my forehead (another area I never really had acne issues with before).  

I feel so helpless and ugly. I absolutely hate that I have acne this bad as an adult. And it doesn’t help that I have a bad habit of picking at my skin already... so the PIE is even worse. Some days I just want to hide in bed away from everyone.  

So SCA, just keep being and doing you. Following this sub has been a light for me on some of my darkest days this year. I hope others who may have similar problems as me know that you’re not alone. I’ll be here and (hopefully) have an update for you all when my skin stops acting like a brat.",1571972734.0,0.8,6

"[Skin Concerns] Losing confidence in routine, I keep getting new cystic acne?","I have combo skin (oily t zone, dry sides) and messed up my barrier with years of Angels on Bare Skin.

I stopped using all oils and Angels on Bare Skin until I could calm my skin down and figure out what was going on. 

The bumps kinda grew into pimples / cystic painful bumps.

I've now been using Vanicream Gentle Cleanser & Lite Lotion for a few weeks.

My skin is looking better, I think. It feels more moisturized, even tho it feels a tad tight after I finish using the Cleanser. But sometimes I lose confidence that it's even working. It seems every day I'm getting new cystic / deep / painful bumps on the sides of my face. They eventually grow into pimples, which I'm trying hard not to touch or pop. I don't know. It doesn't look too much worse, but they're still cropping up (at more or less a constant rate?). How long should I wait until it seems more under control?

I'm just kinda feeling bad for even trying the OCM because it seemed it messed up my face more than Angels on Bare Skin. Angels kept me dry, but at least I didn't get cystic bumps :( I wonder if it's ever gonna clear up and get to like it was before.",1571971768.0,1.0,1

[Routine Help] Need Help w/ Incorporating TO's Products,"Age: 16
Sex: Male
Race: African-American
Skin Type: Oily
Acne Type: Mild, but somewhat stubborn

So my routine has changed a LOT since 2016/2017, and my skin has seen it all. I've been through Clean & Clear (hate them, their products are the only ones that my skin hates), salicylic acid (used at 2% for a scrub), benzoyl peroxide (used at 10% in a cleanser), glycolic acid, sea kelp extract, vitamin c, clay, ACV, etc. My skin is really resilient and can surprisingly handle a lot of ingredients well.

My routine is the following:

AM

0. Pre-wash with warm water to remove surface dirt and allow for soap to glide better.

1. Wash with liquid black soap for about a minute, and wash off. Pat face dry.

2. (Before yesterday) Massage Thrive Face Balm onto face and neck.

PM

0. Pre-wash with warm water to remove surface dirt and allow for soap to glide better.

1. Wash with liquid black soap for about a minute, and wash off. Pat face dry.

2. Press Andalou Naturals Turmeric + C Enlighten Serum into face and neck.

3. (Before yesterday) Massage Thrive Face Balm onto face and neck.

On Sunday nights, I use my Andalou Naturals Pumpkin Honey Glycolic Mask after my serum. 

On Wednesday nights, I use my Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask after my serum, use my serum again, and then use my Andalou Naturals Pumpkin Honey Glycolic Mask .

On Friday Nights, I just use my Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask after my serum, and then use my serum again.

Key Things:

1. I'm out of a moisturizer, but I do have cold pressed argan oil. It's not a moisturizer, but it's the closest I have to it. I haven't moisturized though in 2 days.

2. I'm going to get hate for this, but I don't use sunscreen. During the week, I get driven to and picked up from school, so I'm only in the sun for about a minute every day (plus there's a large tree by the entrance with shade). However, I should work on using it when I'm outside for long periods of time, as I get way too lazy.

My question is should I add The Ordinary's Niacinamide + Zinc and the Glycolic Toning Solution to my routine? I've read some horror stories about the niacinamide regarding ""niacin flush"", acne flare ups, and scars that they've had trouble fixing. I've also read reviews where people say they've had bad reactions to it, but I also see people love it a lot. Seeing as I really don't react much to new ingredients, should I take a gamble?

Also, since I use my glycolic mask twice a week and I don't have a good toner, should I use the toning solution? If so, when in my routine, and how often? I'd really love your feedback.",1571967740.0,0.6,10

"[Acne] Deep small bump around chin turned into a pimple with a hardened head, how should I proceed?","So I had a cluster of small, under the skin bumps around my chin since my last period which I had always thought were just deep hormonal pimples and figured they would either go away on their own time or I’d eventually get my hands on a chemical exfoliator to gently exfoliate them out. One of the bumps recently developed into a somewhat deep pimple that came to a head and hardened. I left it on my face because I had just ordered cosrx pimple patches and didn’t want to pop it until I had my bandages to put over it. I just popped it (I lanced it carefully, squeezed out some of the gunk and then placed a hydrocolliod over it) but I was wondering if there’s something else I should be doing. I’ve had experiences in the past where I’ve used a hydrocolloid bandage on a deep pimple and it’s ripped out all of the gunk and left a hole so I’m not sure what’s the gentlest method for me to go about taking care of this.

[Personal] My 6 month skincare journey. From hopeless to hopeful - thanks to this community.,"I've been a long time lurker on this subreddit, but felt compelled to share my journey after gaining so much from all of you. I also hope I now have some knowledge to share after finally being happy with my skin in so long.

&nbsp;

*Back story:* For the last 2-3 years, my skin has been incredibly dry, irritated, sensitive, red and prone to cystic acne. It was also dull and starting to get a lot of fine lines and hyperpigmentation (but I assumed this was just ageing and pretty much irreversible.) Basically every single skin concern you can have, all over my face. 

&nbsp;

I got unhealthily obsessed with skincare and must have spent 1000€+ on products within a year (Avene, LRP, TO, Cerave, etc etc). I saw a dermatologist, without much success and everything I put on my skin just seemed to make it worse - even the most delicate products designed for highly sensitive skin. 

&nbsp;

I came across a post on this community about damaging you skin barrier that really resonated with me and I ended up throwing everything I owned away (I actually now regret that as I've ended up repurchasing a lot of things) But it helped in the long run.

&nbsp;

After years of exfoliation, the skin barrier article made complete sense to me. I had done so much damage to my skin that it was completely ruined to the point that even things like the LRP cicalplast balm irritated me.  I decided to go back to basics... I was strict with only a Cerave moisturising cleanser, a treatment cream recommended by my dermo and LRP shaka fluid sunscreen. The first weeks where really rough. My dry skin was so bad and flaky, I felt compelled to exfoliate and did a few times with a Konjac sponge, but for the rest I kept it simple. 

&nbsp;

Fast forward to 6 months later and my skin has never looked better. I have a glow, no dryness, limited redness, tighter skin and minimal breakouts - infact now I have the opposite problem, my skin has become slightly oily - I thought my dry skin must be genetic because i've had it for so many years, but in actual fact it was just very damaged. Now i actually have come to like the glow of a bit of oil.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I wanted this post to help people who like me, keep spending hundreds of dollars on skincare products and who are not seeing results and feeling more and more hopeless, you start to believe that skin is ""just like that"" and always will be. The truth could be that all the money you are spending on 'helpful' products are just doing more harm than good. Take a break, let your skin really heal and it will be worth it.

&nbsp;

After 6 months, I have finally reintroduced actives, and for the first time they are working well with no irritation. I thought my skin just 'hated' retinols and acids, but really I just had a damaged skin barrier that needed time to repair itself.

&nbsp;

**A few other things that helped improve things:**

- Double Cleansing (LRP Micellar water and Cerave moisturising cleanser)
- Cleansing for 60 seconds (reduced my breakouts by 50%)
- Changing pillowcases every few days
- Improving diet as much as I can (I definitely could still eat better though) 
- Getting enough sleep (listen to the podcast ""Why we sleep"" to learn why it's important
- Not eating salt before bed and sleeping with a slightly raised pillow (reduced eye puffiness by 80%)

I used to self harm and have a range of scars that are for the most part flat or slightly sunken in. Some have redness and “fuzziness” (undefined borders?) around them. I’ve been through some old threads and found many people seeing good results with silicones.

Now the question: what types of silicones and what products that have them should I look at? I’ve been planning on getting TO’s vitamin C in dimethicone because I find that it is a silicone that doesn’t break me out or cause irritation. I also figured the vitamin C would help with fading the discolored tissue and reduce some of the redness. Plus the price was good considering the surface area I need to use this over.

[Product Question] Thoughts on legitimacy of Purito Green Level Unscented Sun SPF50 PA++++,"Hello everyone,

I, like many others, was ecstatic to try out Purito's new unscented sunscreen. It is the ONLY sunscreen I have tried that doesn't dry out my dehydration-prone skin. 

I can't use anything with alcohol, so for a loooooong time Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk has been my HG, but although it always kept my skin protected (even on 100+ degree beach days), it dries out my skin horribly. 

The release of Purito's Unscented initially seemed like a GODSEND, especially after reading [LabMuffin's review](https://labmuffin.com/purito-sunscreen-review-safe-sun-unscented-sun-comfy-water-sun-block/) (who is really the only skincare blogger I feel I can trust). However, due to conflicting information about the actual UVA protection of the sunscreen that I continuously keep on stumbling across, I can't help but feel skeptical about the legitimacy of Purito's PPD test. (Sorry Purito!!!!!! I hope so badly I'm just being paranoid!!!)

[This is their product's page.](https://puritoen.com/product/purito-centella-green-level-unscented-sun/54/category/71/display/1/) They provide a chart stating that the PPD is 22.59. In their Q&A section at the bottom of the page, they state the UV filter's percentages (3% of Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate and 2% of Ethylhexyl Triazone).

Anyways, what are everyone's thoughts on all of this info? I know I'm not the only one who's been speculating. Does anyone have personal experience after wearing this sunscreen? I'm far from a chemist, so if the filter %s are accurate are they enough to provide legitimate protection? etc... etc.... etc....",1571952484.0,0.9,20

I'm wondering if I'm applying it wrongly or too often? I have pretty oily skin so I apply a thin layer over my face post-cleanse a few times a week and make sure I moisturise extra, but usually I just apply it directly to a pimple at night.

I just got off my period so maybe it's hormonal but it's a LOT worse than usual. I'm wary of going to my gp since I feel like it's trivial compared to other issues I have.....but it's really affecting my self-esteem and feeding into my depression so. Idk.

On weekend I was exposed to what I think fungal/bacterial acne - I was in direct contact with the person and their pillow.
-In 2-3 days I noticed flat red spots on my forehead. 1 became small a bit painful pimple, another became colorless small bump which is slightly painful when pressed. Still some red flat spots on the forehead, which are red in the mornings. 
-A day later flat painless small spots around mouth and on lower cheeks - coming and going.
-maybe small bumps like closed comedomas on my forehead (but i sometimes had them myself)

I am trying not to panic. I started to take zink supplements. As it is impossible to get to dermatologist before something really serious, I found some vaginal cream Econazole, applying it on my forehead and other spots. I wash my head with Nizoral shampoo, just in case.

QUESTION: if I won’t get some real cysts or huge pimples, let’s say in 1 week, then can I exclude the reason of catching those fungal/bacterial acne this person had? Can I say that those weird breakouts are result of my personal routine etc?",1571948230.0,0.99,1
[Acne] My skin is Dry/Combination but I can't find anything to fix it. What are some tips?,"I'm posting from my boyfriends account because I don't have one.  


From the sidebar I've determined my skin is combination but it is mostly dry. I have had acne in the past and the retinoids the doctors gave me dried my skin out even more to the point of cracking and bleeding.  
My skin is quite sensitive as anything new causes spots or breakouts. I also have been told that my face can appear red by a pharmacist, and alongside the info in the wiki I'm wondering if it could be rosacea?

[Skin Concerns] How can I relieve this irritation around my eyes?,"Hi there, I'll also post this to the eczema subreddit when i get the chance, just wondering if you guys had any advice? My apologies if this belongs in the advice thread.

I have these patches of dry, scaly skin around my eyes, most notably on my right. It doesn't seem to have been triggered by anything, I have not changed my routine in months and we're long past hayfever season here (though this first appeared August-time). I *do* have diagnosed eczema, though it is usually on my hands and very obviously caused by irritants like clothing, extreme weather/moisture, and responds to steroid creams just fine. The patches near my eyes are similar in texture but are obviously different in that they itch and burn like hell. I cannot describe to you how much this sucks. Looking at screen in a dark room (ie. a lecture theatre) seems to make it worse. 

My routine looks like this:

* AM: Wash Simple moisturising facial wash (""soap free foam"")
   * Simple soothing facial toner (the one with niacinamide in it, though i dont put this anywhere near my eyes, just my cheeks)
   * Moisturise with Nivea Creme
* PM: Simple purifying cleansing lotion (sometimes) (again not near eyes)
   * Moisturise with Nivea creme

I will of course book a GP appointment ASAP, however waiting times are very long here, I have spoken to a pharmacist and he said not to put steroid creams on it as the skin is so thin, and to use a mild/fragrance free moisturiser. Notably some moisturisers do make my skin burn, particularly around my eyes (E45 in the big bottle and simple rich lotion do this).

I was wondering if any of you knew of any short-term ways of soothing it while I wait for a doctor? Scratching brings sweet sweet relief for about 5 seconds and I have used the cool metal of my water bottle in a pinch. pls help",1571946844.0,1.0,6

Anxiety + bad skin help!!! [Product Question],"Hey guys, first time posting here, I apologize if I break any rules or this isn't the right sub.

I suffer from anxiety which causes me to pick my face constantly. Even if I have no pimples or massive blackheads, I go around and most times I find a kind of subdermal whiteheads (I don't know the proper name, but it's like pimples with ""gunk"" under the skin). I am trying to control my anxiety about them, but for me they are very noticeable and I was wondering if you guys had any suggestions/tips about clearing them without popping and leaving a red long-lasting mark like I use to. I use a normal pimple face-wash (Clean and Clear 3 in 1 anti blackheads) but it's causing my skin to dry out excessively and it's not really helping. I have no clue on what to use instead.

[Skin Concerns] Do I need to do extractions or do I just wait for skin to unclog itself?,"I have skin that is both dry and oily and as a result I am prone to very bumpy, congested skin consisting of open and closed comedones and some keratin bumps. This is all over my face including the forehead, temples, cheeks and nose!

I have recently started a new regime and it seems to be helping with the Cerave Smoothing SA Cleanser and  Smoothing Cream which contain Salycilic Acid and Urea (in the cream). These products are helping after just a few days and my skin seems a bit smoother.

Usually my comedones etc are quite stubborn and hard to extract but I am noticing that some are getting easier to squeeze which seems like a good sign.

My question is do I need to do extractions or if I just wait will the products do most of the work and my various bumps and blackheads will just go over the next few weeks?

My plan was to do what I could at home and then after a few weeks go to a beauty therapist to have any stubborn bumps etc extracted I just don't know what I should be doing?

Should I just wait, follow my regime for a few weeks more or should I be steaming my face, extracting or using a clay mask (does that even work it remove bumps?)

So should I extract or should I just wait and if I should extract how best to help unblock the bumps?

[Routine Help] Trying to lighten PIH/PIE,"I was pretty horrible to myself in my teens. Never used sunscreen (although I was rarely ever outdoors) and always had a terrible skin picking habit. My skin now is clear for the most part, but there's some pigmentation I'd like to get rid of in the form of freckles/sunspots and redness. I've been trying to work on a routine to lighten these and wondering if I could improve it.

AM:

* Rinse with water
* Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Hyaluronic Serum
* Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer
* Eucerin Daily Protection Face Lotion SPF30
* IT Cosmetics CC+ SPF50 if I'm going out

PM:

* Micellar water

* The Ordinary Peeling Solution AHA30%+BHA2%

* Admire My Skin 2% Hydroquinone

[Acne] I have some questions about my acne and the things I have been prescribed. Your help will be appreciated!,"I scrubbed my face with sugar 5 months ago and my forehead broke out after 2 days. I have never had acne like this ever. The pimples I normally have, hurt and itch and go away with time. But the acne on my forehead doesn't hurt or itch, I don't feel anything. It has almost been 5 months now and the acne I have on my forehead, has persisted for 5 months and not showing any signs of going away, which is the only problem I have. I'm not breaking out or anything, just this stubborn acne isn't going away. [This is what it looks like](https://i.imgur.com/dcjQUkV.jpg)

I had consulted with the best dermatologist in my city, 10 days ago, and these are the things he prescribed:
**•Isotretinoin 20 mg on alternative nights(80mg per week) for 2 months.**
**•Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Lotion 1%.**
**•Fusidin(Fusidic Acid cream).**
**•Cefuroxime(antibacterial) 250mg for 20 days** 

The reason I'm posting here is that, the clindamycin lotion doesn't seem to be working well, because my pimples are getting more inflamed since the day I have started applying that. It looked better before I started using that. I would have thought that it was because of Isotretinoin's initial effects, but it had started getting inflamed after the first time I applied it, before taking my first isotretinoin pill. I'm not saying that it should work in just 10 days, but it's making my acne more inflamed. It has been 10 days, I have taken 5 isotretinoin pills, and I'm applying everything regularly but I haven't seen any improvement yet, it became more inflamed instead.

The question is, should I stop using clindamycin or should I wait for everything to eventually work? it doesn't seem to be working, to me though.

Also, if that doesn't work, do you think isotretinoin will treat my stubborn acne? The dose is low, that too on alternative days and I'm not sure if it will work or not. I haven't started experiencing any of the side effects yet, my skin is still oily, lips are fine, and everything is normal.",1571942205.0,0.5,2
[Routine Help] Which of these products do you think is the most effective against Anti-Aging/Eye Wrinkles?,"After heavy research ive compiled a list of products and ingredients that seem to be the most reputable when it comes to anti-aging. I’m leaving out tretinoin since it is prescription and the purpose of me doing this is to get a gift for my sister for her birthday because she asked for an eye cream (which i refuse to get!)

1. Timeless Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid (the only one I trust because of its PH, and because Skinceuticals is too expensive) or NIOD Ethylated L-Ascorbic Acid 30%

2. Timeless Matrixyl 3000

3. Timeless Matrixyl Synthe’6

4. Isomers Matrixyl-4 (although I havent seen any reviews on it, but the premise sounds good)

5. Skin Medica TNS (uses EGF, perhaps the most reputable brand for it)

6. Survival by NIOD (full of antioxidants, blue light protection, etc) . (Or Literally any product from NIOD, I’m surprised it isn’t talked about more on here.)

7. Adapalene 0.1% or Retinaldehyde  — I’m actually unsure which is most appropriate to put around the eyes and which has more anti-aging benefits. 

8. DermaRoller

9. Acid Peels. For around the eyes, it looks like TCA 7% is recommended, but I wont be purchasing that for her because I don’t want her to burn herself. Makeup Artists’s Choice and Platinum Skincare seem like good brands with efficient pH’s.

* Aquaphor or Cerave Healing Ointment slathered on THICK

I’ll go through my morning routine, and after after about 45 minutes, my face has lost all feeling of moisturization. It feels dry, and tight, especially on my upper cheeks and under my eyes. My skin starts flaking again by early afternoon. I’ve read the skincare science guide on dehydrated skin, and as far as I know, I’m doing the right things…hyaluronic acid, creams, occlusives. I feel like none of it is working. My skin was the best it has ever been through the summer, but now with the changing seasons, I’m struggling to keep up from the dryness.  I have a prescription for tretinoin (for acne) and have used it successfully in the past but have had to stop since my skin has gotten so dry. 

I get the feeling that my sunscreens are making things worse, as they both feel so drying,(generally dislike them both) but I’m really not sure about any of it at this point. I’m considering trying Elta MD physical sunscreen…would this be a reasonable choice for my skin?

As far as the rest of my routine, I’m a broke graduate student – so I’m not going to repurchase the Dermalogica when I run out. I’m also phasing out the Honest Beauty Hydrogel for since I’ve gone though it SO fast and have to repurchase it every 3 weeks. I ADORE it though and would love to find something similar at a more affordable price point (for how often I'm repurchasing.)  If I can’t, I might just end up back with it again. 

In short: 

1.  Any suggestions/thoughts on healing my super dehydrated skin? Anything major I’m missing/doing wrong?

2.  Sunscreen recommendations that don’t make this problem worse

3.  Inexpensive hydrogel creams like Honest Beauty’s?",1571941756.0,1.0,7
[Skin concerns] How do reduce my redness and texture?,"[my skin ](https://imgur.com/a/CMfXY3k)

Hi! I was just wondering if anyone had any advice for dealing with redness and texture? I have really sensitive skin and have to be careful about what I put on it.

•La Roche Posay Dermo cleanser 

•Pyunkang yul essence toner (new product)*

•Elf beauty shield vitamin c serum (new product)*

•Cerave eye cream 

•Glow recipe watermelon moisturiser 

•La Roche posay Shaka fluid spf 50 (new product)*

Chest spots help [Acne],"So ever since may when I went to the beach with my chest exposed without sunscreen I have had these bumps on my chest that I can’t seem to get rid of. The breakout started out awful and a walk in doctor made me apply betaderm because he thought it was a sun reaction. It helped a little but no where near enough. My doctor gave me doxycycline after I couldn’t get rid of residual bumps and kept having little breakouts. I took it and my skin cleared after 2 weeks. When I stopped, within 3 days I broke out massively. I was going away so I got another dose to hold me over. My skin cleared again within 2 weeks. I got back home, saw the dermatologist after the doxy ran out and she started me on itraconazole and a topical cream with antibiotics, an antifungal and hydrocortisone. My skin cleared completely and was clear for about a week after stopping itraconazole. She then told me to keep up with the cream and to take fluconazole once a week to fully get rid of it. Now I have little bumps that seem to just come up as soon as others heal. They are so small and not super red or anything but I’m so frustrated and done. I’m not sure what to do. Anyone had an experience like this?

So as studied, limiting the degradation of Retinoic acid could make your Retinol, Retinaldehyde, Retinoid Ester more effective.

Its anti-fungal activity is also great to deal with fungal acne, seborrheic dermititis and dandruff.

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense: SPF 50 Tinted sunscreen|B+ for performance, F for lack of skin tone inclusivity|$34 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Good for sensitive skin, and did not sting mine.                  -- Covers up slight redness and evens out skin tone, if it matches yours. Seems to last all day if not rubbed or touched.                      --Cosmetically elegant formula that goes well under makeup once it dries.|\-- Only offers one shade that works for Caucasian skin tones. Surprise!           -- Clings to dry patches, so you must beware of this while using.|
|Skinceuticals Sheer Physical UV Defense: SPF 50 Transparent|D due to performance|$34 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Spreads very well and provides impressive coverage... if you are as white as a vampire.|\-- Intense white cast. STAY AWAY unless you are already extremely pale and want to look even paler. This is not a realistic sunscreen.   --Clings to dry patches horribly- you must exfoliate before using.  Creates white ""creases"" under eyes and in eyelids.|
|Elta MD UV Daily Broad Spectrum SPF 40|C+ due to clogged pores. Great otherwise, would be A++ if not for this :(|$28.50 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Highly moisturizing and does not highlight dry patches.  --Dries quickly and goes very well under makeup  --Niacinamide free!

Ugh. This is the only reason I can no longer use this sunscreen.|
|Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46|A+ for non sensitive skin.                                                 (Niacinamide-sensitive folks like me can't use this unfortunately.)|$35 for 1.7 fluid oz.|\-- Moisturizing and does not cling to dry skin whatsoever            -- No white cast              -Not greasy                        --Goes well under makeup.                                --You can reapply without washing it off.  --Non comedogenic. Never ever broke me out.|\--Expensive. --The only other con is  that niacinamide sensitive people can't use this! For me, it caused a rosacea flare and my cheeks broke into a veiny red rash. UGH, it's perfect otherwise, hence why I tried using it for  weeks hoping my skin would adjust.   --EDIT: Another user mentioned this pilling for them.|

[Routine Help] Skincare and biking to work,"Hi everyone.

I had my routine on lock for a couple years now.

AM: Nothing, sometimes wash with water. Neutrogena sunscreen.

PM: Paula's Choice Pore Normalizing Cleanser, Gokujyun hyaluronic acid toner, and marula oil (various brands, all of which agreed with my skin). Occasionally The Ordinary Azelaic acid, various brands of vitamin c, and aztec clay mask.

I recently started biking to work, 30 minutes each way and I feel it's thrown things out of wack for me. I also moved to NYC a few months ago. My skin doesn't respond to marula oil, in fact it triggers acne. Aztec clay mask doesn't refresh my face like it once did. Whatever is wrong with my skin, acid is not helping and makes things worse. I applied just the HA toner on my face, but that doesn't help or makes things worse.

I'm getting acne where I usually don't (my forehead). My face looks dull, uneven, and kind of red. I'm really frustrated because things have been going so well and now I can really figure out the problem. Is it cleanser, hydration, moisturizing? I don't know.

So my question/request is two fold.

Any ideas of what might be going wrong?

[Acne] Major Acne on my chin and jawline area (Male 27),"Hey guys. I'm a 27 year old male that's dealing with major acne around the chin area.

I used to have a lot of acne on my forehead and cheek but it's gotten a lot better after cleaning my diet by getting rid of dairy and sugar.

But recently, acne started popping up around my jawline and it's been really frustrating. I've been doing the following:

1. No dairy and sugar. Eat a lot of whole foods and green vegetables. Also avoid greasy and fried foods.
2. Take multi-vitamins, Omega 3 Fat supplements, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin B12.
3. Do face wash ONCE a day.
4. After facewash, apply moisturizer on my face.
5. Wear sunscreen everytime I step outside.
6. Never touch my face.
7. After powerlifting, take a shower immediately.

After doing all these things, I still face major acne on my chin and it itches sometimes. My forehead and my cheeks are fine, but it's just my chin... I've read on reddit that this is hormonal acne and that I have too much of an imbalance on my hormones. If this is true, how can I solve my acne issue as a male?

Thank you reddit!",1571932240.0,1.0,2
"[product question] What cleanser for post-swimming dry, irritated skin?","When I’m finished swimming, my face skin feels dry and tight and stripped but also like it has some kind of residue on it. I’m looking for a super gentle, absolutely fragrance-free cleanser (or double-cleansing option) that will help get some of that chlorine off my face. 

I’ve just recently started putting LRP Cicaplast Baume or Vaseline over my face before swimming to give it a bit of a barrier, so I’m leaning towards double cleansing with an oil cleanser/balm and maybe something like the Avene Extremely Gentle cleanser afterwards? Would the Avene be enough to remove the oil cleanser? I feel like the Avene on its own wouldn’t really thoroughly wash my face post-swim, which is a shame because I love the stuff and otherwise it would be perfect.

I feel like I’m happy with the rest of my routine for swimming, it’s just the cleansing part I can’t figure out!

"[Skin Concerns] How to increase skin ""plumpness""?","Hi everyone,

I'm pretty young (23) so I'm not overly concerned about aging. I have noticed, however, that my skin doesn't have the same 'plumpness' anymore.

I'm putting this down mostly to weight loss and bone structure. I'm potentially too thin, rn.

I have noticed, however, that plenty of thin people still have that plump fresh face look.

I'm working on optimizing my diet, taking a ton of vitamin C, drinking more water, getting more sleep and quitting the nicotine (picked up vaping as a nasty habit when I was stressed in college, yikes!).

My skin care routine rn is probably not great (and overpriced):

* Micellar water to cleanse
* Emma Hardie balm cleanser
* Good Genes by Sunday Riley (3-4 times a week, and only at night)
* CEO moisturizer by Sunday Riley
* Tatcha eye cream
* Emma Hardie sunscreen

Sometimes I also cover my face in vaseline at night just because I feel like it does something?

I've always kind of had ""thin"" skin, if that makes sense. It's like it's stretchy and a bit loose. Not just on my face,  all over. I'm also very double jointed in some areas, so I'm wondering if I might just naturally make less collagen? My skin is otherwise combination but pretty dry.

[Product Question] Drunk Elephant lala vs The Ordinary NMF,"Hello - I once tried Drunk Elephants lala retro which felt very nice. But I understand it didn’t do much other than moisturise. Which is what my Nivea cream does and also what my The Ordinary NMF does. So I decided against it. Then DE changed the formula to add ceramides.  Which seems to be great for the winter months.

However I note NMF has ceramides (correct?) it just feels different than the DE version. I added a drop of Marula oil in it and it feels quite similar.  My question here is:

How different is DE lala from TO NMF? 
Are there many (or any) benefits?
Would adding Marula to NMF make it similar?

I know I’ve really really simplified something that may be a lot more complicated.

[Misc] Why did my skin seem to get better in the hospital?,"I’ll try to be brief!

I went into the hospital on Sunday afternoon and was finally released on Tuesday afternoon (infected cat bite, no bueno).  I had last showered on Friday night before I went in but had been obviously washing and moisturizing my face.  I didn’t shower on Saturday because I was just too tired and figured I’d shower on Sunday but I ended up in the ER and they told me I was being admitted.  I didn’t want to shower in the hospital shower and I didn’t really stink or anything 🤷🏻‍♀️

Sunday morning I had washed and moisturized and wore a thin layer of powder foundation to help counteract my redness.  When I got to the hospital, I was kind of nervous to wash my face with harsh hospital soap so from Sunday afternoon to Tuesday afternoon, I just never washed my face.  I was asleep most of the time anyway.  And I.  Looked.  Awesome.  I’m sure my powder foundation had rubbed off but my redness was way down, my skin didn’t hurt like it always seems to because it’s so dry and I looked a little dewy but not oily.  For like 3 days of not washing or moisturizing my face.

Why did this happen?  Should I just leave my face alone at home and see what happens?  I want THAT skin!!!  Maybe it was just the IV fluids?  The extreme antibiotics?  Awful hospital food?  Anyone have any thoughts as to why my skin cooperated??",1571923002.0,1.0,19
[Routine Help] Using Azelaic Acid for Closed Comedones,"Hi Everyone,

I’ve had severe closed comedones on my face (forehead, cheeks, and jawline) for a few months, so the doctor recently prescribed me with Finacea which is 15% azelaic acid. I also have red acne on my cheeksI started using it two weeks ago and I use it everyday during the morning and evening. I’m not the most knowledgeable about skincare, so was wondering if I could get advice about my routine and the order of using products.

AM:

* Cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
* Wait 5 minutes and apply Finacea (15% Azelaic Acid)
* Wait 5 minutes and apply Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Face Cream with Hyaluronic Acid for Extra Dry Skin
* Wait 2 minutes and apply SPF

PM:

* Cleanse with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser
* Wait 5 minutes and apply COSRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid OR Paula's Choice BHA (I alternate between these 2 everyday)
* Wait 20 minutes minutes and apply Finacea (15% Azelaic Acid)

Masks:

* Sulfur De la Cruz mask twice a week for 10 minutes

I’m confused about the order and wait time between using the above products. Should I use the AHA/BHA before or after the Finacea? And when should I use the moisturizer? 

Some other questions I have:

1. I've been reading about Hyaluronic Acid and was wondering if I need to use a different moisturizer on top of the Nuetrogena Hydroboost or will this alone be enough?
2. Is there room to incorporate TO Niacinamide in my current routine? If so, in where in my routine do I add this and how often do I use it?

[Product Question] Should I be worried about layering other skincare products on top of Polysporin/Neosporin?,"As I was washing my face just now with a warm washcloth, one of the pimples I’ve been dealing with popped and left a hole. I dabbed some Polysporin on it and I’m thinking of continuing with the rest of my routine (Thayers Witch hazel toner, Cosrx 96 snail essence, Rosehip oil) but I’ve had situations in the past where my Cosrx snail mucin has reacted negatively with my benzoyl peroxide and left chemical burns on my face and ever since then, I’ve been weary of layering new things under my routine. So, has anyone ever experienced any negative reactions when they layered certain skin care products on top of Polysporin or Neosporin?",1571892219.0,0.5,1
[Routine help] acne with anti aging - vitamin C and retinoids?,"Hi all, hoping for some help on this. Early 30s with occasional cysts and a really terrible work schedule so I'm trying to find a somewhat simple routine that can miraculously help with acne, fade some scars, and get the jump on anti-aging . Easy, right? 

I'm pretty dry around the chin (with pimples here) and somewhat oily on my forehead. Used accutane years ago which got rid of 99% of the cysts but I tend to get 1-2 a month, usually on my chin or cheekbones near my ears. Scars are on my chin.

Currently here is what I do:

AM: splash face with water, then use some TO caffeine serum under my eyes and hyaluronic acid overall. Put on SPF 50 and light makeup on top

PM: wash the TO squalene cleanser, use glycolic acid pad 2-3x per week, use sephora brand under eye cream and then DE marula oil overall.

Once a week: DE retinoid mixed with Dr Jart ceraminide lotion (otherwise I get really irritated). On a different night I use DE babyfacial or TO aha bha mask. I use hydrocolloid patches as needed overnight for breakouts. 

I have some DE vitamin C serum that I don't really know how to incorporate and I worry it'll make me break out more. I'm also not sure if the glycolic acid pads are really doing much except making my zits dry and flakey on my chin. I'd love to increase my retinoid usage but am scared by lots of peeling at work.

Any suggestions?",1571892039.0,1.0,3

"[Routine Help] Looking for suggestions pertaining to facial cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreens!","Good evening pals,

I am in desperate need of structure and cleanliness. Really looking to improve my hygiene overall. My morning and nightly routine are the first steps towards that!

First off:
I am looking for a few good products to kick off the start of my routine. I would like product recommendations under $10. My skin is fair in color and somewhat of a combination, leaning more towards dry. There are some places I get more oily where my hair touches, i.e. my forehead and the ""contour"" area of my cheeks right in front of my ears. The rest of my skin is usually dry.

Cleanser:
I am looking for a cleanser that doesn't irritate the skin, but gets it *clean*. I typically wear makeup and plan on wearing moisturizers and sunscreen. I also run in the mornings before my shower and need something that will leave me feeling fresh after being drenched in sweat. Something I can use AM/PM. Back when I lived with my parents, I remember using my mother's battery operated facial cleaning brush and always feeling very clean afterwards. Is this something I should invest in and how often can I use it? Daily?

Moisturizer:
I would like something hydrating for my dry skin, but not too heavy. I have had bad luck with lotions/moisturizers in the past feeling ""thick"", too oily, or drying out too quickly. I have seen good reviews for Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel Cream, though the product is expensive for the amount. Would I run into trouble if I used the Hydro Boost Body Gel Cream on my face?

Sunscreen:
Really at a loss of what to ask for here. Nothing too thick, but with a good SPF and protection for my fair skin. I don't want it to end up feeling oily and would like something that has staying power through sweat as I live in a high humidity year round area.

Makeup wipes:
I have the worst luck with makeup removing wipes. The ones I have tried feel as though they have almost no moisture in them and feel grainy/rough against my skin. Wipes are a must for me to remove a full face of makeup at the end of the day. I use to use cold cream which removes makeup like a dream, but I hated washing it off of my face/wiping it off with tissue. Same with liquid makeup removers. Wipes are a plus for me because it's all in one; I don't have to rub my fingers all over the product and my face of makeup (which usually ends in having to scrub my hands) I just use the wipe and never touch the icky stuff on my face!

Also, semi unrelated as I am talking about facial products, but I would *love* recommendations for:

Body wash with a good smell and *actually* cleans everything.
All over body lotion. 
& last but not least, good hand sanitizer?? I actually love hand sanitizer. I recently went to Bath & Body Works and they had scented hand sanitizers with scents like Georgia Peach and Japanese Cherry Blossom (my absolute favorite scent). However I don't need it to be scented, just quality to get my hands clean in between being able to wash.",1571889765.0,0.33,2

[Review] The answer to my dry dry dry tret skin prayers: Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream. (No more slug life!!),"Hi all, so I've been using tret (0.025%) for almost a year I think? Anyways, I already had dry + dehydration-prone skin prior to starting it. I had to ease into it, starting with Differin, suuuuuper slowly. 

I've tried **everything** to moisturize my skin. But holy crap, whenever I put makeup on, it looked so, so, so dry, cracking, flakey mess. I tried the slug life for YEARS using various occlusives - Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe healing ointment, Eucerin original healing cream, even 100% lanolin (broke me out :T). I'm into asian skincare so I already use like 23432 hydrating steps and lots of moisturizers underneath. 

But NOTHING was actually eliminating it?????? I couldn't stand one more day in lizard face. 

I have NO idea why, but for SOME REASON, the Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream gets rid of this problem. It just gets along with my skin so well???? I don't even NEED to slug life anymore! I just put that on as my last step and I wake up with mochi-hydrated skin!! I can't believe it tbh. I tried SO many moisturizers.. 

Well, I should say that the **combination** of using **tret every OTHER day plus using the Aveeno** as a sleeping mask has really saved my skin. No more nasty, cracking makeup!! 

I freakin' HATE the feeling of super stickiness that slugging gave me. I hate my skin sticking to things. Aveeno cream isn't perfect, but it's like 100000% less sticky than the other stuff I've tried. 

&#x200B;

Cons:

\- It can **pill. Horribly.** But only if you pair it with the wrong stuff. Some lotions/creams work well with it, and some don't (Clinique moisture surge cream & LRP lipikar AP+ baume do NOT play well with it, for example, but Triderma Eczema cream & Gold Bond Diabetics lotion are a-ok). This isn't a big problem for me though because I really only need *this* cream on top of my hydrating toners/serums to make my skin happy. 

\- This one is obvious but, please do not use if anything in this cream breaks you out. 

&#x200B;

I'm sure there are probably a lot of more expensive stuff out there that works just as well, but if you're strapped for money like I am, and aren't super acne-prone, this is a good option. If it doesn't work out for your face, you can always use it on your body/hands! 

(My Illiyoon ato ceramide cream just came in the mail today, so hopefully, it works well with it! So excited to try this!)

[Skin Concern] - What are these sudden bumps and how can I get rid of them?," https://imgur.com/hKJFI36 

Ok all, I need help. Typically I have clear skin and have never really had problems. Except these pesky bumps literally appeared overnight and I need to know how to get rid of them! My hunch is that I was using a drying routine. I've also been going through hormonal changes (switching BC). Before switching up my routine I'd use a direct acid and not moisturize, or just use Daily CeraVe. I have the same bumps around my chin that appeared around this time last year, when I started BC. If this is hormonal related, can I still treat it topically?

Here's my routine now:

Day:

Wash with water or with cream carrot cleanser from Yes to Carrots

Vitamin C powder TO + marine haularounics TO

Blue Lizard Face Sunscreen

Night: 

Wash with Yes to Carrots cream cleanser

TO Glycolic Acid

TO Squalane oil

CeraVe in the tub moisturizer 

&#x200B;

I've heard CeraVe in the tub can cause these, but I don't think its the issue since using it alone has never caused the bumps to appear.

[skin concerns] stubborn raised scars when I *don’t* pick at acne!,"Does anyone else face this problem?

If I DO pick, I get just the red mark that persists for weeks. Is there any way to deal with these zits that neither of these things happen? Is it the hydrocolloid patches?

[Routine Help] I think I'm double cleansing wrong... HELP!,"So I'll start off by saying that I have combo (dry/ oily) skin that is acne prone and tends to get pretty congested. However, I've been hitting a good stride with clearing up my skin and so I've been a little more comfortable experimenting with new products.

I recently purchased my first cleaning oil since YouTubers like Susan Yara and Liah Yoo seem to swear by a double cleanse. I picked up **THE FACE SHOP - Rice Water Bright Light Cleansing Oil** and have been using it for a few days in conjunction with my bar of **African Black Soap** (which gets very foamy). I must say that so far I am seriously disappointed with the results.

My makeup removing and cleansing process goes as following:

1. I use one pump of the cleansing oil on my dry skin and rub it around to dissolve my makeup
2. I dampen my hands with a little water and continue rubbing so the oil creates a bit of a creamy lather
3. I wash my face and try to get as much oil off as I can with just water
4. I then wash my face a second time with the African Black Soap bar
5. I pat dry my face and move on to other skincare steps

Now here are my issues- I expect that the double cleanse should take off all my heavy makeup (foundation, setting powder, bronzer, blush and highlighter) but when I tone after doing the steps listed above I'm still seeing makeup on the cotton pad. I also feel like my skin still has an oily residue ( which makes me scared that my pores are going to clog and I'm going to breakout like crazy)

This was not happening with the makeup removing balm I used and now I'm wondering if maybe the double cleanse is just not for me or maybe I'm doing something wrong. Can someone please weigh in?",1571882458.0,1.0,9

Looking for a nightly moisturizer [product question] [routine],"Hi everyone,  

Just looking for some recommendations for a nightly moisturizer. I think I have more oily/combination skin. My main “problems” are some closed comedones on my chin, I get the occasional pimple elsewhere, dark circles and puffiness under my eyes, forehead wrinkles,  and I’m prone to mosquito bites (idk if that matters). Here is my routine:

AM:
Wash face with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser OR Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser

Apply Korres Wild Rose Vitamin C eye cream under eyes, wait a bit

Apply glossier bubble wrap under eyes, wait a bit

Mix a little Korres wild rose vitamin c serum with glossier priming moisturizer and apply to face, wait a bit

Apply biore UV water essence spf 50+, wait like 10-20 min and apply makeup (not a whole lot but I use skin tint and a little bronzer over my whole face)

PM:
Remove mascara with up&up oil free eye makeup remover when I use waterproof mascara (which is often)

Wash face with cetaphil daily facial cleanser OR gentle skin cleanser OR glossier milky jelly cleanser 

Sometimes (it goes from 0x/week to 3ish x/week) either Paula’s choice skin perfecting 8% AHA gel, or sometimes I alternate with Stridex maximum strength salicylic acid pads (I don’t use these as often, maybe a couple times a month)


Sometimes apply Korres vitamin c eye cream or another under eye cream I got in Greece 

For PM moisturizer I’ve been using Korres Greek  Yogurt 48hr moisture Pro advanced sleeping facial but am almost out. 


Before that, I used fresh lotus youth preserve dream night cream, and I have used exuviance age reverse hydrafirm several different times. I liked these but they are a bit pricey for me so I’m looking for something a bit cheaper. I usually don’t mind fragrance as you can tell, as long as it’s light (of the 3 night moisturizers I listed, I really really loved the fresh lotus the best.) I’m looking for something that can keep my skin well-moisturized overnight and will help with forehead wrinkles. I have some minor wrinkles elsewhere, but I am constantly scrunching and furrowing my eyebrows throughout the day (and night I’m sure) and have been for years. It’s an awful habit and I don’t notice I do it but my husband tries to remind me and I always have headaches because of it. Anyway, I’m trying to stop doing it but would like a nightly moisturizer to help me out if possible. From what I remember, exuviance was the best on my wrinkles, fresh lotus wasn’t so bad, and the korres greek yogurt helped some days but not most. I’d really appreciate some recommendations and also feedback on my routine if you guys wouldn’t mind. Thanks so much!",1571877680.0,0.25,2

"[Routine Help] Oil Cleanser helped my oily skin, but it also broke me out. Do you guys have any drugstore alternatives?","Last month, I finally decided to purchase an oil cleanser since I'd heard that it was good for oily skin. I pretty much picked one at random, because the one I was looking for was not sold at my local Walmart. I ended up getting Burt's Bees Cleansing Coconut + Argan Oil. I tried using it both standalone as well as to double cleanse. After about a week, my face began to look much more normal. I honestly haven't felt that confident in myself since I hit puberty, so it was a great feeling. Unfortunately, I also quickly realized that my acne was beginning to come back (at that point, I hadn't had a pimple in about 3 months). Using that oil cleanser was the only change that I made, so I stopped using it immediately. Last week, I was feeling really down and decided to use it once again, in case that breakout had been a fluke. It was the exact same result, although I only used long enough to get the breakout but not enough for it to help my oily skin. I'm now 20 dollars down the drain, although it seems that I've finally found a solution to my longstanding problem (I've dealth with extremely oily skin for about 2 years now).

[Routine Help] I need some help with double cleansing (oil cleansing),"So I've been trying multiple oil cleansers on my skin to remove makeup, such as the DHC one, Hada Labo and Kose Softymo Speedy. Sadly they all dry out/irritate my sensitive skin... I was thinking of making a DIY one, but the emulsifier Cremollient is not available where I live and the alternatives are very irritating.

&#x200B;

So my thought was; Why not just use a plain oil to break the makeup and then use a normal cream/gel cleanser to remove that all..

&#x200B;

So I have a couple of questions

\- Would using a plain oil, and then washing that off with another cleanser, be fine to cleanse? Or is a specifically emulsifying oil cleanser needed instead of just a plain oil?

\- If so, what very gentle cleanser with a very minimal ingredient list, can take off this oil/makeup? I am sensitive to a lot of ingredients like niacinamide, and all the lotion/cream cleansers I've tried did not remove oil (Avene and LRP).",1571874083.0,0.81,11

I went back, got an even STRONGER cortisone, used that for a week, AND STILL the problem persists. Every single day, I've been applying the anti-fungal, using dans-cortibalm, and vaseline, with no avail.

[Skin concerns] Face feels sticky after washing it,"Hey guys. So I've been washing my face with the CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser since July and sometimes after I wash my face it's sticky. After I rinse it doesn't feel weird or like my face isn't clean but when after I dry my face, I notice the stickyness. It isn't every time either. Maybe like 2-3 times a week it happens. And also I only wash my face at night.

Should I stop washing my face with the product or use less of it? It has been helping a bit and it helped out my forehead a lot. I used to have all those tiny bumps all over my forehead (which made me look like one of those Nestles crunch bars) and they went away. So I'm worried that if I stop using it, they will come back.

[Routine Help] So confused about the routine The Ordinary suggested for me - Please advise if necessary!,"A few days ago I emailed The Ordinary to ask how to sort out the products that I had in a routine. However, I’m a bit confused about a few things and I hope y’all can help me. 

I’m 24F in New England, USA, with pale, combo-dry, sensitive skin. 

My main concerns are: 
- Post Inflammatory Erythema and Hyperpigmentation 
- Closed Comedones (1-2, nothing crazy but annoying nonetheless)
- Some texture but it’s getting better! (Thank goodness.)
- Hormonal breakouts (I’m on Spironolactone (50 mg) and birth control (Yasmin) for this reason. So far so good, but I’m only on month 3 of taking each medication) 

**MORNING:**
1. Clean (I only splash water on my face)
2. The Ordinary “Buffet”
3. The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% 
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA
5. Sun Protection

**EVENING:** (I am thinking of doing this 2x a week: Monday’s and Friday’s) 
1. Clean (Vanicream Gentle) 
2. The Ordinary “Buffet”
3. The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion (previously Advanced Retinoid 2%)
4. The Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane
5. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if needed)

**EVENING #2:** (My plan with this is 1x a month; Wednesday’s)
1. Clean
2. The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution
3. The Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if needed)

**EVENING #3:** (Again, my ideal plan is 1-2x per month: Sunday’s)
1. Clean
2. The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution
3. The Ordinary 100% Plant Derived Squalane
4. The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (if needed)

And as most of you guys know, TO suggest alternating between the ‪three PM‬ routines throughout the week.

Here is my CURRENT routine: 

**AM:**
- I take a paper towel dampened with tepid water and gently wash off the Aquaphor from the night before. Then, take another sheet and pat my skin gently to wake myself up. 
- **SunBum Face Lotion SPF 50**

I am a very minimalistic type of girl. Especially in the morning. Less is better for my skin and mental health (anxiety, OCD and depression). 

**PM:**
- If I wear makeup, I use **DHC Deep Oil Cleanser** for 60 seconds, and, then, my **Vanicream cleanser**. But if I don’t, I repeat the tepid water compress on my face but with a microfiber towel for 10 minutes. This has really helped keep my skin clear. I have no idea why! It’s truly a mystery y’all, but I’m so relieved it does such a miracle. I’ve been doing this for about two months. 
- I then mist my face with DISTILLED water, and pat on **CosRx Snail Mucin Essence**
- **TO Buffet** is then applied 
- As of two days ago, I implemented **Stratia Liquid Gold** for the purpose of dehydration and some leftover moisture barrier issues. 
- **Vanicream Lite Lotion** or my **Aveeno Eczema Baby Lotion** 
> I bought the **CeraVe Baby Cream** today. Thinking of using that soon. I’m kinda skeptical because of an experience with other CeraVe products, but I heard this is different. So, I’ll definitely patch test to lower my anxiety. Has anyone used this moisturizer? Love to know your thoughts on it. Especially if you also have sensitive skin, too. 
- **Aquaphor** around the lower part of my face, chin and neck 

Now. **My 2 questions:**

- Is my plan for when to use the retinoid, the glycolic 7% toner, and the AHA BHA mask appropriate? I know that it would be way too much to use an acid with an acid. Moreover, a retinoid and a glycolic product. 

My intention with both is to get rid of texture, stop any breakouts, fade my PIE and PIH and smooth out my skin. 

- What would the Niacinamide + Zinc help with, exactly? I’m wary about using it due to horror stories on here from people saying they broke out with using it. So, I’m thinking of not putting it in my routine at all. Unless, y’all tell me otherwise!

I am a 18 year old woman and I have recently made the terrible discovery that I have fine lines around my mouth, on my forehead, and lightly between my eyebrows.

I still have acne and small acne scars now even after putting on Retanoids, taking vitamins, and having skin treatments. I wish I could have told my younger self to care more about my skin because my parents are in their 50’s and look like they’re in their 30’s.

[Skin Concerns] Does collagen improve or worsen scars??,"
Hi friends,

I really need help confirming whether or not collagen intake/production:synthesis helps wounds heal with LESS scar tissue or if it makes them heal with MORE scar tissue.

I’ve been doing a lot of reading and can’t seem to find the answer... I’ve read information supporting both sides... 

I get that collagen is crucial to healing and regeneration of tissues but given that scar tissue also consists of collagen, from what I’m reading it sounds like it can actually cause MORE scar tissue to form as the wound heals..

Is there a Goldilocks zone/happy medium to obtain? Should I supplement with collagen to decrease my chances of scarring or should I not bother because too much collagen really will just accumulate at the injury site and leave me with an even worse scar that I would’ve had normally?",1571863324.0,1.0,2

Dry patches/texture?: i have these weird patches on my brow bone where makeup doesn't cling unless i really pack it there :(

As of a week ago I started to break out around my mouth. Strange, quasi itchy zits that have a lot of pressure. I, being the dumbass I am, squeezed them. Was able to extract most. Despite the immediate relief, there is hyperpigmentation that I'm sure I'm worsening every time I weld.

(Note¹ I wash my face at lunch •The Ordinary squalane cleanser, apply toner, moisturizer, SPF 30 or 40)

I'm not wearing a respirator, nothing is making direct contact with my mouth. I work in an air conditioned facility, so I don't find myself overtly sweaty at any point. Yes, I get dirty, but moreso on other areas of my face. I touch my skin as little as possible and cleanse during and after work.

[Routine Help] Not sure if I'm doing something wrong,"Link to pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/4wVATcu](https://imgur.com/a/4wVATcu) (tried to make an Image/Link post but the buttons are greyed out for some reason :0 )

Hello!

My (21, F) skin’s been acting up for a couple of years, but about half a year ago it suddenly got a lot worse and it's been bothering me ever since. I started using my mom’s skincare products (didn’t have a routine at all before that) and they definitely seemed to help a bit, but it seems that no matter how much I moisturize, cleanse or take care not to touch my face, it will always find a new way or reason to break out. A few weeks ago I felt like I’d almost gotten my acne under control with the help of benzoylperoxide but then my face suddenly got super flaky and painful. It just started peeling off around the bottom of my jaw, edges of my face and all around my eyes. I assumed dehydrated skin as a result of overuse of products was the issue, so I completely stopped cleansing for a couple of days. I used ludicrous amounts of vitamin e cream to relieve the stinging and itchiness.... which eventually helped! My skin slowly got back to normal, but then I started getting weird red rashes with tiny red bumps going down from the corners of my mouth to the bottom of my chin. They would appear after finishing my routine, so I stopped using the cream and swapped out my mom’s skincare products for a milk cleanser + cleansing lotion combination that’s supposedly better suited for sensitive skin. I started using those but despite all that I’m now once again stuck with this stubborn ring of Gross around my mouth (as seen in the pictures :\^) ). Yesterday a massive cyst *also* decided to pop up on my chin and I just don’t know what to try next, so I was hoping someone on here might be able to offer some advice. Am I missing something? I listed my current routine below, thanks for taking a look!

Morning:

\- Take off benzoylperoxide from night before with cleanser, avoiding other skin as it gets irritated if I cleanse twice a day

\- Moisturize with “De Tuinen” Aloe Vera Day and Night cream

Evening:

\- Cleanse with “De Tuinen” Dead Sea Cleansing Milk

\- Repeat with “De Tuinen” Dead Sea Cleanising Lotion

\- Moisturize with “De Tuinen” Aloe Vera Day and Night cream

\- Put “Teva” Benzoylperoxide 10% on any pimples

\- I’ve been slapping hydrolloid bandages on the cyst on my chin but it doesn’t seem to have done much. I read they work better when it’s come to a head so today I pressed a warm compress to my chin a bunch of times to coax it out but that hasn’t done much apart from making it less painful, which is nice, but not what I want :(

Skin concerns: Acne around chin and mouth. Occasionally nose and forehead as well, but I can mostly avoid those by not touching my face and keeping my hair clean. Perpetual redness with slight bumps that sometimes turn into tiny gross whiteheads around nose. Weird purple blotches all over my face in general. Cysts on chin (although I haven’t had as many since I started using BP) and very rarely on nose wings. Greasy white bumps on chin that never go away but are generally only visible when the skin is pulled taut like in the bottom left picture.

Extra information: I already swapped out my old toothpaste (as well as shampoo) for one without lauryl sulfate and I think it helped a little! I drink lots of water and have been on birth control for years. When I forget my bc I feel like I’m much more prone to breakouts. I’m pretty sure I have combination skin cause my nose is a lot more shiny than the rest of my face.",1571851390.0,1.0,5

[Anti-Aging] thinking about tretinoin for anti aging,"I'm 30 and have clear skin with a few little scars/discoloration from acne or sun. I currently use a moisturizer with SPF in it every day, and a few times a week I use a self tanner oil on my face because my face is always paler than the rest of me. Other than that I use nothing, not even a cleanser, my skin seems to prefer being left alone so I just do warm water morning and night before applying moisturizer again. This has been working really well for a few years and I don't want to mess with it, but I'm also starting to wonder if I should be doing more for anti aging now that I'm 30.

I read about tretinoin, would this be a good option for me? If so what exactly do I ask for, is there a percentage or something? I'm planning to just ask my regular Dr to prescribe it, he's pretty chill, and I read that you should say it's for acne scarring not for anti aging. I'm just not sure if I ask him for tretinoin, or if I have to be more specific.

"[Skin concerns] Rapid eyelid aging (starting to sink, cross hatched, thin skin, hollow under eyes), is it just ""normal"" to see aging happen over the course of months? (31yo)","Hi,  I went from getting carded at 30 to avoiding mirrors in the course of 6 months. I had milky plump eyelids and now the inner corner is sunken, this cross hatch wrinkle pattern appeared on my inner and middle eyelids and the proper eyelid (above lashes) is so thin I can see the veins (which makes the skin look brownish). In the year that this happened the following things changed in my life:

* I changed jobs (air conditioned office, windows don't open)
* I lost maybe 5 kilo (which I am now gaining back hoping this will help)
* I had pneumonia
* I drank way less milk (now trying to go back to old dietary habits in case this had something to do with collagen)

Could any of those things have such a rapid effect on the eyelid skin? (I also have hypothyroidism)

When I do the collagen test (pinch skin to see if the ""skin tent"" appears) the skin on my eyelids does form the tent for a while (my hands on the other hand not at all).

My skincare routine before this was Nivea soft and sunscreen and water (no makeup). I now got into topical vitamin A but can't say I'm seeing any results. I am willing to try some collagen procedures/treatments but what can be done for the whole eyelid (from eyelash line to brow)? I want my plump eyes back:(

EDIT: Having read half this sub since posting I think this might be damaged moisture barrier. Skin really shouldn't go to sh\*t over such a short period of time!

"[Routine Help] Help introducing Retinol into my routine. And general advice for young, pimply, menopausal skin.","So I have this lovely thing called menopause at the age of 25! 

h o o r a h 😑

This has wrecked havoc on my skin. It lost it's natural glow and aged quite rapidly in 2 years, due to lack of natural hormones, AND I have PERMANENT hormonal acne all over my chin. Massive, bulbous, scabby spots, that take 3 months to heal- by which time there's already been 8 new big old spots around it. 

Just a note, I'm not looking for advice on HRT management, I'm looking into that constantly with my gynaecologist. I'm looking for external skin care advice 💗

Current routine: 
https://imgur.com/a/sl2fpx9

It works well enough, I know there is no solving a big problem like hormonal acne like my case with just over the counter treatments, it's all tied into my HRT etc. So I'm happy enough. I use a spot treatment on any pimples that are MAJOR, but a lot of them make me break out in a rash.

Onto introducing Retinol. I've tried twice to introduce it into my routine, first a couple years ago with the Neutrogena retinol range. My skin burned, flaked, screamed out to stop, even with the lightest amount on every third night. So I binned it, it all seemed too much. 

Flash forward to now. 
I started on the ""Paula's Choice Barrier Repair Moisturiser with Retinol"", because I thought it would be a good, kid gloves start. I had no reaction in my skin but I assume that's because the dose of retinol is piss weak and basically like not using it at all. 

Three nights ago I used the ""Paula's choice CLINICAL 1% Retinol Treatment"" instead of the moisturiser. AND IT BURNS. I thought it would be a super low amount. My skin is peeling, red and it burns especially on my neck, under my eyes and around my nose. Is this something I just have to fight and get through??? Plz halp. Is there an easier way to ""get into"" retinol. 

Any help and general advice for my skin would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to look through my regime.",1571817062.0,0.9,18

[PSA] Please remember that aging and having wrinkles will NOT make you worth less than someone that’s young or without wrinkles,"I just read a post on here that said they stopped making big smiles because they noticed wrinkles around their mouth. Smiling is your right! 

Why is it that most of us sacrifice the joys in our lives to look younger? We will all age, get wrinkles, and die anyways theres nothing stopping the natural order of life. There are so many stressors in life as we get older and cutting off simple things like smiling and not being in the sun is just burning your mental even more.

After I discovered this subredit I get uncomfortable in the sun. I used to just walk to school with my face in the sun and it felt nice. Walking to school was a really nice relaxing time for me in the mornings. I used to not think about being in the sun, but these days my first thought is “sun BAD” and I am inside quick. Knowledge is really the devil. I’m trying to be less harsh on myself for being outside if I forget sunscreen. 

Another comment I saw said that they trained themselves to stop showing facial emotion at 18.....what??? Imagine spending the majority of your young and healthy life as an emotionless robot just to have 2 less wrinkles when you’re 40.

[Skin concerns] closed comedones or hypertrophic acne scars?,"https://imgur.com/a/PCoYu3h

I have these raised, flesh colored bumps that are only on my chin (and predominantly on one side). They aren't really rough but I can feel that they are raised. They have been there for years without going away. After researching I thought they might be closed comedones but now I am thinking papular acne scars. I never had issues with acne growing up until 2013 when I had an acneiform due to a clinical trial drug I was on for 2 years. I didn't get treated until I was off the drug but my face was pretty rough. I could have used this sub then! I know I have some other scars from that time.

Right now my routine:

AM- 
splash face with water
Retinol serum (tree of life)
The Ordinary Azaleic acid (not always each day) 
CosRx hyaluronic acid
Cosrx snail mucin
Ceravae moisturizer PM
Ceravae moisturizer AM w/SPF
 I'm probably weird for using both am and PM but my skin gets really dry, and the cerave pm is the only product of theirs so far I don't like. It gets gloppy on me. I need to find a new spf when I'm out.

PM-
Wash with gentle hydrating cleanser Cerave
Retinol
Hyaluronic acid
The Ordinary Lactic acid
azaleic acid
Snail mucin
Cerave pm

I just started regularly putting in azaleic acid, though I have had it for some time. I'm also missing my vitamin C which is a holy grail product of mine.

I did have to dilute it a bit as using it at full strength made my skin sting like hell, is this okay?

"[Skin Concerns] Favorite products to combat redness, scaring, and acne?","Throwaway because I'm pretty embarrassed by my skin. I applaud everyone who posts photos!

I need help with my routine, specifically what actives I should add to help get some redness, acne and old scarring under control. Mid 30s female and I feel like I can't get my skin to settle down. I went a bit overboard initially with trying loads of products and couldn't tell what was doing what so I scaled back significantly. I've been on a steady simple routine for the past few months without much improvement.

Skin type: dry, eczema prone, dealing with redness and acne scarring around nose, closed comedones and whiteheads on nose and chin with occasional deep dark painful pimples, dark under eye circles and some hyper-pigmentation.

AM- Rinse water or wash with Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser depending on how my face feels- Thayer's Alcohol Free Toner- Cerave Daily w/SPF 30- Etude House SPF 50 (if I am going to be spending time outside or if it's summer - I live in the PNW and work in an office, so usually I feel like the Cerave is enough)

PM- Banila Cleanse it Zero (love this for melting off eye makeup) or Garnier pink Micellar water if I am not wearing much makeup- Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser- Cerave tub

I've tried adding a few things into this routine:- Stridex Red every other day - Did this for weeks and no change- Pixi Glow Tonic every other day - I didn't use this very long but didn't see much change either- Ordinary Granactive Retinoid in Squalene - Have used once a week for 6 weeks with not much change, going to start twice a week

I've been toying with the idea of trying a different toner or adding different actives, specifically the Ordinary Azealic acid or Ordinary Niacinamide. Or is it time to see a dermatologist? I don't have a ton of acne but what I do have has been bothering me for years (especially my forever red and scarred nose). Ugh!

[Miscellaneous] A bunch of silly questions from a confused lurker.,"1. What exactly is a toner?  
  

2. How do you apply multiple layers of moisturizer without your face becoming an oil well?  
  
  
  
3. Why does every moisturizer I use give my face a shine or oily appearance. When I pass under a light it looks like I just ran a marathon.



4. How can people do ""contact treatment"" of their skin by leaving their cleanser on? I was told to leave it on for like 10 seconds at most, and if I leave it on for 60 seconds it sucks all the oil and moisture out of my skin and leaves it dry.

5. How am I supposed to use BP? Everytime I apply it it just dries the hell out of the skin in that area, and leaves a residue from the white cream. I'll use it as a spot treatment once and have peeling skin/residue in that area for a week.

6. When I apply a product to my face, am I spreading the acne germs around? Like if I pass a cotton pad with moisturizer over a pimple and then onto an area of my skin that is acne free, am I spreading the acne to that area?

7. Is it always a bad thing if a product burns, even just slightly? For instance a moisturizer with salicylic acid seems to me like it should burn slightly since it is an acid and it is supposed to enlarge pores. 

8. Why is it so difficult to find a good moisturizer? I have tried Cerave regular (made my skin tingle and slightly itch, made my skin oily at the end of the day), Nivea classic (way too heavy, made my skin so shiny), Clean & Cleanser moisturizer with salicylic acid (probably the best yet but made my skin slightly burn and sometimes tingle and itch slightly). 

9. When people say that their skin feels hydrated do they just mean shiny? Because sure if I apply like a ton of vaseline then my skin will be 100% hydrated but I will also look like a lunatic. 

10. Why is my face constantly itching (like tiny pricks of a needle, sometimes hurtful that last for like 10 naghing seconds) even though I applied a moisturizer? 

11. When ppl say they get acne on their jawline, do they mean like only on the 1 inch strip of skin along their jawline, or also like lower cheek/sideburns/chin.

12. Is it possible to get hormonal acne as a guy?

13. Can having shiny skin after applying a moisturizer clog my pores and cause acne?

14. Is it fine to apply products with a cotton makeup pad instead of fingertips?",1571798754.0,0.72,2

[Skin Concerns] Am I Overtreating?,"I’ve been using Differin for 6-8 months now and rarely experience irritation.

It’s 2% hydroquinone plus glycolic acid, which I’m using every other morning. 

My skin doesn’t feel dry or dehydrated but at night my skin stings just slightly when I use Thayers alcohol free toner. The weird thing is, I use that same toner in the morning in lieu of face wash and it doesn’t sting then.

My main concern is the small blackheads on either side of my nose and flakiness in the creases of my nose which is why I thought an AHA would be useful. I think I might be experiencing purging due to the increased texture of the blackheads, do I need to be concerned about that? Also, how do I incorporate retinol? Other than the blackheads/texture I'm concerned about aging.

PM

[Skin Concerns] Skin Irritation/Burn,"Last evening before leaving work, I got a small chemical burn above my forehead. From the moment I saw it to now (almost 24hrs later) its still leaking clear water looking substance from there even though there is no real redness or burning.

I’ve talked to poison control twice, pharmacist, who sent me to ER Dr, Family Dr and 811 and non can figure out why its leaking water from it.

 They all say just keep washing it, don’t put poly etc on it. Dr said try milk or baking soda but I’m worried that will cause and infection. Tried poly now because I got tired of nothing happening, makes it burn more



Just texture change which is hard to notice and constant very little burning and water “weeping” from it (exactly like water not even plasma looking). Gets worst when exposed to air compared to kept dry under gauze/ band aid.

I don’t get how it could be the paint thinner/reducer/hardener as I’ve been working with these products for years and have had them splash on me before. They burn and cause redness and irritation that you won’t ignore. However this was so subtle when it was burning at work I didn’t think much of it.

Only other things that it could be is fibre glass (material or glue). Also I had pimples there, maybe some of it went inside that area?

I've tried everything-- every Rx topical treatment, every over-the-counter acne treatment, antibiotics, different types of birth control, I even went on Accutane for two months. Currently, my skin is worse than it has ever been. My skin is extremely sensitive after taking Accutane so my skin can no longer handle harsh acne treatments with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, but with a completely gentle routine, there's nothing to get my acne to calm down. I'm not sure if this is a hormonal issue, I feel like I've tried everything and at a loss for what to do. I only use clean towels on my face, I change my pillowcases regularly, I don't touch or pick at my face, I never pop pimples, I drink a lot of water, I avoid dairy, I wear sunscreen every day and am religious about my skincare routine.

AM: Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser, Mario Badescu Rose Water and Aloe Spray, Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Moisturizer, Glossier Bubblewrap Eye Cream, and It Cosmetics Bye-Bye Foundation Full Coverage Moisturizer with SPF 50

PM: Bioderma Micellar Water, Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser, (every other night) Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA chemical exfoliant, Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief serum,  Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Moisturize, and Glossier Bubblewrap Eye Cream.

I used to use washes with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, use clindamycin, tretinoin, and spot treatments, but my skin was so inflamed, irritated, and worse than it is now. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I get new breakouts every day, but my skin is also very red and I have a lot of flat red marks where acne used to be which makes my skin look worse. I also have a lot of hyperpigmentation from my years of acne.

Over a week ago I got hit by a ball right in the middle of my glasses on the bridge of my nose. I did a good job icing it and it was sore for a few days and was definitely swollen and a bit bruised in the days after.  


Fast forward to now, about a week and a half later. There really isn't much swelling (if any at all) but where my bruises were on the top of the bridge of my nose and the right side of my nose (where the bruises were) there are what appear to be blackheads.

[acne] Has anyone taken their IUD out because of acne? Closed comedones galore (29/F),"I had been taking oral contraceptives for years before getting a Mirena. I broke out on my forehead (closed comedones) but was given tret/clindamycin and it died down afterwards. I chalked it up to transitioning from oral cont to Mirena.

A few years later, the acne has now returned. I have closed comedones all over my forehead and, during specific times of the month, the comedones become inflamed and painful. I also get cysts on my chin. It feels like braille on my forehead. None of it is terrible (according to my husband, but I suppose he has to say that), but I have never experienced this acne in my life (teens included) and it really hits my confidence hard during these times of the month and the discoloration from the acne has started building up.

I eat well, drink plenty of water, and take care of my skin. I've tried dietary changes (quitting dairy, etc.), hundreds of dollars worth of skincare, facials... some of helped but ultimately I've realized my acne is hormonal. I have great weeks where my skin is happy and then, along with bloating and the other lady-time-of-the-month things, my acne comes back.

**Has anyone experienced this acne with Mirena? Has anyone gone BACK to oral contraceptives?** I was a happy camper for a few years with Mirena but it really seems to be the culprit the last few years. I've asked my doctor to go back to oral contraceptives and she's put me on Junel to take for a few months along with keeping my IUD. If my acne improves I'll take my IUD out.

"Why do dermatologists ""prescribe"" such expensive skincare products (or have expensive skincare lines that they recommend to their patients)?

The total price for the 3 serums  + derma roller that she recommended came to almost **$800.00.** 

However, I felt like this was a huge mark up. The derma roller she recommended was almost $150.00 (when I have seen them for way cheaper on Amazon). And this is something I have noticed at most dermatology clinics where they have ridiculously expensive skincare products. He also never prescribed me anything like Retin-A, tretinoin,

[routine help] Whats breaking me out,"I've posted here before regarding my routine and took everything into account and also changed my routine up a bit myself.

I'm at a loss now, my skin has been non stop breaking out since January, sometimes it clears up but my acne always comes back.

I have social anxiety and my acne makes it super hard to deal with it.

My current routine:

Am:

Wash face with water(before it use to be squalene oil but I have taken it out recently to see whether my skin improves)

Moisturise with aloe propolis soothing gel and aveeno cream (I use to use these products separately depending on how my skin felt but it either made my skin dry or oily but using them together seems to balance it out)

Precious mineral BB cream moist SPF 50

Pm:

Wash face with water

I would use either salicylic acid 2%, TO retinoids 2% or Cosrx aha glycolic acid 5%. (I spread these out throughout the month. I have been using the BHA the most while it helped at first it stopped becoming effective really quickly, the same with the retinoids as well they used to be very effective but now it doesn't really help my acne but it is really good for my scars that's why I still use it still sometimes)

Which bitches said castor oil doesn't cause hair to grow [Review],"Product: PraNaturals Cold Pressed Castor Oil

Used it for 6 days or a week 

Got it on Amazon; the packaging was just the oil tub wrapped in plastic 

Product is thick and viscous and smell isnt very pleasant tbh so just add a drop or two of tea tree oil lol


Positives:
Never told my family i was using it and two different people in my family said how dark thick and longer my eyelashes and eyebrows were. Whoever is selling the idea that castor oil doesnt work for hair growth is bullshitting (but presumably to sell another non-castor hair growth product)
Can also be used for other things apparently such as stretch marks or dry skin if used in small quantities with a lotion

Negatives: Smell, thickness, use tea tree oil for relief from smell 

It does do what it said it would do. I advise you to get cold pressed castor oil which is pure instead of ones with other ingredients added.

Conclusion: Used castor oil, im a male, and they grew in less than a week considerably (and i *mean* it)

"[Sun Care] Reapplying sunscreen, questions from a germaphobe...","Hi all,

This has been on my mind a lot lately ever since getting serious about suncare and protecting my skin with sunscreen.

I know I have to reapply throughout the day, but I cannot get over the thought of doing this.

I have OCD and part of that comes having a phobia of germs. I am posting this in hopes of getting some insight about reapplying throughout the day.

Let me first start off by saying my skin is incredibly oily, I have a fear of spreading all of that oil and dirt / pollutants collected on my skin throughout the day when reapplying sunscreen.

Even after blotting my face, I still feel as if my face is 'dirty' and don't want to be reapplying a product to dirty skin.

I wash my hands many times throughout the day, but still, even after washing them, I still feel like there are germs that will be spread on my face. 

How does this work and how do you reapply sunscreen throughout the day.

After my morning skincare routine, I do not touch my face until I shower at night. I will blot the oils off midday but that's it.",1571771115.0,0.94,36
[Routine Help] HELP: went on a skincare purchasing spree and not sure which of the 'Actives' products I should prioritise/can mix together," 

I’ve recently decided to incorporate some of products listed below into my skin care routine (such as the retinol, BHA and salicylic acid) after reading some of the threads here and also getting recs from friends. Still super clueless as to how I can mix some of these (pretty sure retinol doesnt go well with salicylic acid or Benzoyl Peroxide for example) so was wondering if I can get some help on constructing (and differentiating) my AM and PM routines. 

The one step I always include is to clean my face with micellar water, but other than that I have no fixed order of things (which I am sure would make things easier and more efficient). Also I usually save the Vitamin C serum only for days when I’ve been tanning as I know it doesn’t help with the absorption of some of these products apparently. Aware of the Cleansers > Actives > Everything else order but a lot of the products I am unsure about fall in the middle so would appreciate any help. 

On a good day, my skin looks pretty alright except for visible pores around the nose area and blackheads on the nose itself once you look closer (wish the photo quality wasn’t this good):

&#x200B;

\^this is something I want to prioritise because I’ve had them since I remember. I was thinking of starting with the BHA liquid + clay mask? how long should I wait for before applying the mask tho?

Also, in the days leading up to my period I always get minor breakouts around the chin area which is super annoying, but for the first time ever breakouts like this on my forehead appeared overnight (which prompted me to go on a skincare purchasing spree):

Sometimes if my skin is really flaky I'll make a homemade scrub with sugar and Argan oil. I'm afraid of most exfoliators at this point because of dry skin.

**Background of my skin:**

* Mid-20's Chinese, Male, Acne-prone + oily skin  


**Process + Results:**

*  For the first 2.5 weeks: I used only these products — oil cleanser, foam cleanser, physical exfoliator, essence, niacinamide, eye cream, benzoyl peroxide, brightening cream moisturizer, salicylic oil, spf, masks (clay/sheet), retinol( my skin purged for these 2.5 weeks, I also had to stop using AHA/BHA & Benzoyl Peroxide for a week because my skin was VERY sensitive) — my acne scars did fade out a little bit though.
*  2.5 weeks - 1 month: I incorporated the Vitamin C Serum into my regimen, at the 1 month mark, I did notice that my acne scars faded out more
*  1 month - Now(October 22, 2019): I incorporated the products — Gentle Brightening AHA/BHA Toner,  Pore Control Serum.  


**Some FYIs:**

* My eye isn't really all that great when it comes to seeing if my  overall skin texture is more even/smooth,brighter (this is kinda ironic and sad at the same time). Though I can see noticeable acne scars fading.
* My problems area regarding my pores is around my T-zone, nose and cheeks. I haven't seen much improvement in the appearance of my pores. (I know that you can't physically decrease the pore size). I did however see a little bit of improvement right under my lacrimal papilla near the top of my nose for both left and right.   


**The downs(problems?):** 

* After incorporating the Clarin's Pore Control Serum, I noticed when I nudge my palms together, (dead skin?) starts forming, this happens on my face when I nudge a spot as well. Is this normal? Currently, there isn't as much (skin?) that forms when I nudge a spot on my face now.
* After applying niacinmaide in my regimen for both day/night. I feel that my face is burning a little bit, this never happened before when I use niacinmaide.
*  I notice that the area under my eye (not really my eye area) is red . I can confirm that this is not eczema as it's not itchy.
*  Applying Benzoyl Peroxide after moisturizer burns a little bit. Then the pain goes away after 15-secs\~. This is probably normal right??

&#x200B;

**My question for you:**

*  Should I change anything in my day/night routine? 
* How long does pore-minimizing products have an effect on pores? 1 month? 2 months? 5 months?
*  I assume the skin below is my eye is a little bit compromised cause it's red. Should I stop my regimen for a week(basically just removing the actives\[AHA/BHA/Vitamin C/Retinol\]) until my skin is better?

  
I purposely didn't disclose most of the products I used. But if there is enough people who wants to know, I'll update this post with the product names.

[Routine Help] Need advice about my skincare routine!,"I  have been visiting a dermatologist for over a year now, they had  initially prescribed me Tretinoin for my acne to use on a nightly basis.  I used it almost nightly (though I recently started to switch to \~2-3  times a week now due to it drying up my eye areas). My dermatologist  also recently told me to add on Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide in the  mornings. I was told to use it was a spot treatment rather than applying  it all over my face.

My main  question regarding this is, having used Tretinoin for nearly a year, and  adding on Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide, how long should I be on  these creams, is this essentially a life-time kind of commitment?

I hope I explained my dilemma properly. So if anyone has irritable eyes, please drop suggestions down below; preferably for oily skin!",1571756465.0,1.0,7
[Miscellaneous] A Very Comprehensive Guide to Vetting Products Before Purchase!,"With ~~Drunk Elephant~~ (whoa little Freudian slip there), er ***Sunday Riley*** recently being [gently scolded by the FTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dl7ca6/miscellaneous_the_ftc_said_sunday_riley_faked/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for fake reviews on Sephora’s website, I’ve seen a lot of confusion and doubt about how to actually find legitimate reviews for products online. I consider myself to be a Jedi Knight in the fine art of Googling and whatever the Jedi equivalent of a Black Belt is in cutting through bullshit, and have honed and crafted my vetting process over many moons of… Googling and cutting through bullshit. Man sometimes a sentence just doesn’t end with that bang you imagined.

I thought I’d share my steps here so you can grab and pick out what you will, and hopefully feel a little less overwhelmed by the fact that everything you read is probably a lie!

**Overview** of the steps I'll cover below in far more detail-

1. Look at what it's supposed to do and throw ingredients list into Cosdna
2. Look only at negative reviews; filter from lowest to highest rated. Ignore 4/5 star reviews
3. Use Google to search for reviews from many different sources (i.e. Google ""{{Product Name}} Reviews"")
4. Get sample if possible; Buy smallest size possible

&#x200B;

**Phase One: Basic Recon** *Oh that product has piqued my interest! What fine retailers might I purchase it at?*

Sometimes I’ll come across a product that has a *je ne sais quoi* about it. Let’s take a real life example from those naughty little review fakers at Sunday Riley and use their Good Genes as our product to research. Few products have been as mega-hyped as Good Genes because *Oprah* loved it and she’s still a thing (maybe? Didn't OWN flop?) and it took off from there. So you'd start with knowing a few things about yourself and what you're looking for.

1. Skin Type (I'm Oily-to-normal)
2. Main Concern you're looking to address with this product (I'm looking to combat acne and large pores + even out my skin tone)
3. What you're comfortable spending (I'm Mid-range to High-end: Not super concerned about a price tag if it’s gonna work. But like not Barbara Sturm $300 for freaking Hyaluronic Acid expensive. We'll call that ""stupid expensive"".)

So let's say I’m all starry-eyed over Good Genes because I got a little short changed on legit good genes and if *The Secret* taught me anything it’s that I bring into my life what I desire. I want good genes so maybe this is the Universe being like- “Hey, I dropped some shit off at Sephora for you.” I first will go to the product's page at Sephora and take a look at two things: the product’s claims and its ingredients.

[Good Gene's Sephora Page](https://www.sephora.com/product/good-genes-all-in-one-lactic-acid-treatment-P309308?skuId=1418581&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939500_pla-419039569134_1418581_257731947995_9029600_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsfGr0eOu5QIVdB-tBh1d3QRzEAQYASABEgJZH_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

So for Good Genes we have the following on it's ""About Me"" section:

""**What it is:** An all-in-one AHA treatment, powered by lactic acid, that clarifies, smooths, and retexturizes the appearance of skin.

**Skin Type:** Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily

**Skincare Concerns:** Fine lines and wrinkles, Pores, Dark spots""

Ok, all of that sounds great and just what I’m looking for- so far so good. If that doesn't sound like what you want from a product just bail at this point. Also, please never put any stock in the “Clinical Results” section of the page that a lot of websites have. Go ahead and read the results for Good Genes and you'll see what I mean.

Now I move on to the ingredients. I usually do a spot check on how far down any of their key ingredients are depending on the product (i.e. if it’s a serum or a moisturizer), but the most important part here for me is to throw the ingredients into Cosdna and see what pops out. I don’t put *huge* stock in comedogenic ratings, but I still want to know if there are any potentially acne-causing ingredients right up top. Likewise with irritants. **Note on Cosdna**: DO NOT TRUST THE PRODUCTS ALREADY IN COSDNA! Ever notice there are like 15 versions of popular products in the Cosdna database and all are like, 1-5 ingredient different from each other? Do **NOT** trust people to copy + paste properly. Not to mention companies change their formulations preeeetty frequently. No, take the time to copy the ingredients from the store's website (bonus points for hitting both the company’s website *and* the retailers, because if there is a formulation change it’ll always be live for the company first- retailers can be slow to update) and paste them into Cosdna’s “analyze ingredients” section. [http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php)

So for Good Genes there is nothing I’m super jazzed about, and there are quite a few possibly comedogenic ingredients + a lot of fancy schmancy extracts (*Lady’s Slipper Orchid Extract?! Give me a f-ing break)* that I’m sure are like only grown on the Isle of Man and harvested by nubile young women after a milk bath or something bizarre. Given that there are a lot of potential acne triggers I’m going to be on the lookout for this in reviews. And feel free to tag in for my example of ""acne"" whatever your particular bête noire is. If you have dry skin and a product has ingredients like alcohol and you’re like 'oh hey that’s drying' then you’ll be watching for that in reviews.

&#x200B;

**Phase Two: The Reviews** *Reading how much people hate things and getting a lesson in how amazingly awful everyone’s spelling and grammar has become!*

Now the fun part, let’s read some reviews! I am now going to share with you my secret to getting the deets on products, right after I tell you about Skillshare! Ha. Ok my secret: I don’t give two shits, or even *one* shit, about the positive reviews. I don’t care that someone thinks Good Genes is awesome. I mean frankly Oprah already told us it was awesome so if you think you’re better then Oprah then you’re stupid and wrong. No matter what site I’m on the first thing I do is filter by “Lowest to Highest Rating.” (Side note: Ever wonder how to spot a fake review from a mile away without needing some computer to do the work? Ever notice how the 5 star reviews are always beautiful, ripe, lusciously complete sentences while the 1 stars are like “this waz trash i hat it awful!!!!” If a review *sounds* polished and put together it most likely was.) In the negative reviews what we are looking for are people with a similar skin type as ours and similar problems they're trying to address. You can pretty easily weed out the people who were hoping for miracles from a product or had an issue with areas outside the formula (company’s customer service, product size, product bottle, etc.) and focus in on those that could apply to you. Let’s snag up a good example for Good Genes from someone that seems to match my skin concerns:

>""Kind of bummed...  
>  
>I wanted so badly to love this. After all the hype and reading all the articles and reviews, I thought this would be magical. I used this faithfully as directed for two months and never noticed a difference in my skin. Nothing seemed brighter, smoother, tighter, etc. I actually stopped using it entirely after the two months because it really broke me out the whole time. I know some said there’s a “purging” period so I kept using it, but no purging period lasts two months. I usually have decently clear skin and this is the only item I changed in my routine that whole time. I gave the rest away to a friend who wanted to try it and hopefully they have better results.”

So honestly Good Genes isn’t sounding too bad after looking through a ton of bad reviews. Mostly people complaining about the smell which like if I can be blunt with you I’d probably put dog poo on my face if I would wake up with perfect skin- call me crazy. A few people reporting breakouts but some sound to me like purging. Ok Sunday, I’m intrigued.

&#x200B;

**Phase Three: Surfing the Web** [*Tubular! Oh shit remember Johnny Tsunami?*](https://images.app.goo.gl/E6Mtr2ncQY5bhxEb7)

Alright, the reviews didn’t turn us off and the ingredients are somewhat promising, so now comes what we'll call ‘casting a wider net’ since we're looking further around the inter***net!*** Ha. **Pro-tip**\- pretend no website ever has built in searching. I *promise* you it’s not as good as Google. Take freaking Reddit for example: ever used Reddit’s dumpster fire of a search feature?! Just use Google. First place I go to look for more reviews and info on a product is usually Reddit, so in this case I’d go to Google and type in “Sunday Riley Good Genes Reddit”. I always start more generic and add in words as necessary- like if I needed to add “reviews” on the end to get better results. Now I start picking through it all!  [As you can see here,](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&oq=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.5681j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) there are MANY posts talking about Good Genes already so you’ll find out a lot about it from reading through them.

For products that are perhaps newer or just less well known, you might find you’ll need to branch out from Reddit. In this case we’d just amend our previous Google search to read “Sunday Riley Good Genes Review”. There are a fair few review sites out there (i.e. Influenster) as well as personal blogs that might have tried and reviewed the product. On sites like Influenster same rules apply- ignore positive reviews and sort by lowest to highest. Oh also **IGNORE AMAZON**! To be frank I never buy skin care off of Amazon (or TJ Maxx/Marshalls for that matter), and I would especially never buy something that’s not licensed to be sold on Amazon because the chances of it being a fake/tampered with/expired are around 100%. If you’re ever finding yourself purchasing something and it’s cheaper than retail price just walk away. Therefore Amazon’s reviews are useless, because these are people reviewing what is likely not the real product.

“What if my product is *brand* new or so obscure I can’t find reviews on it?”

If it’s brand new I’d suggest looking at similar products from that company if possible to get a feel for them. Unless you *KNOW* a particular ingredient set is exactly what you’re looking I'd advise waiting it out on new products or at the very least getting a sample. My skin is not something I enjoy being adventurous with (but I also said like 3 paragraphs up something about dog poop on my face? so I think I undercut my point here). If a product is not new, and you *still* can’t find *ANYTHING* on it I would: **MAKE SURE THE COMPANY IS LEGIT**!

I have seen a lot of posts recently about people buying 'Provence Beauty' from TJ Maxx. I tried to help someone verify one of their products and couldn’t find ANYTHING on it. The brand themselves seems sketchy at best, and there is not a trace of any of the products that people purchased from TJ Maxx online. If the company seems iffy, *DO NOT BUY SKIN CARE FROM THEM!* It’s not worth it guys. If the company is legit, but just not very mainstream, you might have to go fishing a bit. I had this experience with Renee Rouleau’s products. This is the only time I actually *ask* a question in the Skin Care subreddit because you can find so much by just searching old posts. In this case I’d recommend heading to the Daily Questions thread and asking if anyone has ever tried {{product\_name}}. If you can’t find anyone who has used it, and the company doesn’t do samples, make positively sure they do full refunds (and include return shipping!) because it’s always a gamble.

**Phase Four: I want that.** *<——- Napoleon Dynamite reference! Anyone? WTF that movie came out in 2004 Jesus Christ!*

Ok so at this point you’ve probably made up your mind one way or another about a product and are ready to move forward. Often I find that my original product search has turned me on to a similar product and I am therefore performing this complex mating ritual with several products simultaneously before selecting the most dominant.

Once I have one I’m serious about your first question should be “Can I get a sample?” Ok guys here is the shitty thing with samples of Skin Care- using something for like three days in a row isn’t going to affect you dramatically one way or the other *unless* you have extreme sensitivities. However it *will* help you weed out little things like texture, smell (lol god smell again), feel (too greasy? too oily?), and how it plays with your other products (i.e. pilling). I always get a sample before I buy something if at all possible. Now if it’s *not* possible due to the availability (online only) or the packaging of the product, I’d recommend seeking out a travel size. Funnily enough this is exactly what I did with Good Genes (my take on it? Like basically the skin care equivalent of the shrugging emoji). I found my biggest problem was I’d buy a full-size product since it’s a bEtTeR vAlUe and then never ever finish it because I’d get right past that point of no return (like literally, can’t return it anymore) and then decide it wasn’t doing it and thank you next it (as someone hovering around 30 I can truthfully say I’ve never even heard that song which you can probably tell). So the hierarchy of purchasing goes: **Sample —> Travel-size —> Smallest size available** ***from the store with the best return policy!***

Sephora has a pretty fantastic return policy, so they’re usually my default. Oh Ulta too. I have this weird snobbish thing about Sephora being somehow better than Ulta? **If you are buying online** be diligent about checking return policies! With skin care you need to find out the following:

* How long do I have to return?
* Can I return open and/or used product? Is it unconditional or based on their discretion?
* Does the company pay for my return or will return shipping be deducted from my refund?
* Is this site well known and liked?

For that last point I’d recommend a similar vetting process as the one you just went through for the product itself. For ‘mainstream’ sites like Sephora, Dermstore, major department stores, etc. (lol Ulta didn’t make the list again! Maybe it’s the orange? Is orange just not classy enough?) you can do a spot check of reviews for their customer service, but on the whole this is going to be far more important for niche sites, smaller companies, and Korean/International beauty sites! Doing a Google search for, say, “Yesstyle reddit reviews” or some combo of that will net you most everything you need to know. Once again if you can’t find *anything* on a company I’d steer clear. If you find a product that is still being manufactured (like Good Genes) and it’s cheaper on the website you're looking at then it normally retails for then *it is cheaper for a reason!* Now companies do have sales, so if Neiman Marcus has 15% off skin care or whatever that’s different, but on the whole if some random seller on eBay is selling Good Genes for $30 that’s not a good deal, that’s herpes. Or hepatitis or.. something idk diseases I guess.

Note on Product Returns: I mean obviously as with most things in life the 11th commandment of “Don’t be a dick” applies here and you shouldn’t abuse company’s return policies. I frankly don’t really give a shit about a company’s bottom line so much as it’s just a huge waste of time and resources. But that said if you’re on the fence about a product after a week or so *RETURN IT!* I have done this with many products that I just wasn’t crazy about (lookin at you Protini) and have never regretted and/or repurchased anything yet. You WILL regret keeping around lackluster products.

Actives do create another can of worms with regards to purging and how long you should wait it out, and honestly I could write another post just about purging. Despite some controversy in my super important opinion purging is most definitely a **Thing**. To be *super* brief about it and distill this down to the key points to ask yourself when you’re thinking “Is this a purge or a breakout?” I would have to say it hinges upon two factors: **Where am I breaking out** and **what do the pimples look like**. Ooh I’m going to make a FLOW CHART!

&#x200B;

Ok that’s a lot of info so I’ll stop there. Notice I didn’t ask my friends about products they use because A. I don’t have any friends and B. Unless they have very similar skin it’s not really going to matter, but you could always include a ‘human contact’ portion of the vetting process if that’s your thing. Let me know if you have any questions about any of this as, I know vetting products can be really overwhelming for some people and I’d love to help you feel more secure in your purchases and find products that will actually work for you!

[acne] Can someone help me out with what may be causing this whiteheads/pustules? not sure what they are,"Hi All!

I seem to be waking up with a couple whiteheads every morning usually around my mouth but sometimes on my chin too. I have very dry/dehyrdated skin so I am currently only using cleanser and moisturizer. So there are a couple of things I am speculating

\-Skin is dehydrated and these are a result of dehydration

\-clogged pores due to the fact I am not using any topicals

\-Perioral Dermatitis

\-Hormonal Outbreak

Does anyone else have these and would like to recommend how I get rid of them? if a topical then would prefer something not horribly strong so it doesn't mess with my skin barrier. I am going to get a hydra facial on Friday to get rid of some redness and hopefully these whiteheads.

I upped the bha 2 nights ago to PC 4% and my SFs are darker and more noticeable. Does congestion go thru a purging process like acne? I got 4 ugly zits in normal places that are already healing so I am purging a little, but the look of my pores...? Is it normal for SFs to get a little worse before better?  The rest of my face is responding nicely with a minor purge and no dehydration. And (yay!!!) a 6 month old blackhead I’ve been trying to extract practically fell out of my face within 8 hours of using the 4%. But the SFs look a tad worse and I’m concerned.

[routine help] Help me create a routine from a basically nonexistent one?,"Routine creation help

Hi friends, this is my first post to skincare addiction after scouring the subreddit for a solid 2 hours. So much amazing information but feeling overwhelmed! 

My current skincare routine is pretty lacklustre. I usually buy some kind of cleanser from Winners that looks cool and use that morning and night. 

I moisturize with Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Fluid in the morning, but nothing at night. 

Sunscreen is pretty non existent except in the summer months when I am on the ocean. I do use Shiseido Urban Environment Tinted UV Protector minimally - once a week at best. 

I used to use Lierec Paris High Peel and that banished my flakes but didn’t seem to cause any redness or issues. I can’t find the product anymore. Womp. 

Skin type is dehydrated oily. It’s gross. I have flakey skin between my brows, on my nose and sometimes on the sides of my chin. My forehead and nose are usually quite slick and I do have the odd breakout but I wouldn’t say I’m acne prone. 

I would love to be rid of the flaky skin and tame the oil down a bit and really just all around take care of this face. 

Can anyone recommend a starting point to a routine that could combat my issues? I don’t have a budget, and am willing to spend good money on quality product but obviously don’t mind cheaper products that work, too.

Since then, I have tried 2% keto cream, lotrimin ultra, stridex, clean and clear toner with SA, happy cappy zinc shampoo (which I found helps a little bit, but I’ve been using it for a month and my forehead still has hundreds of bumps on it and it’s showing no sign of improvement, just staying the same.) I’ve used econazole nitrate (which I’m using with my happy cappy shampoo and I don’t think it’s helping at all, but it’s also not making it worse so I’m continuing to use it.) and I’ve used sulfur which doesn’t work for my skin at all and made it look awful. 
I’ve tried Avène cleansing foam and it made my skin breakout. And I’ve tried the hada labo skin plumping gel which also made my skin breakout.
My current routine is vanicream cleanser, happy cappy shampoo, garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream, then econazole. (I’ve been on this routine for a month now and it’s now clearing.) 
I’ve been on an oral anti fungal for a month now, with no signs of clearing. And I’ve been taking a zinc supplement, which I just quit because I saw no improvements.

[Routine Help] A Couple Of Questions About Oil Cleansing,"Hey Everyone!

I have been using the Oil Cleansing Method for a few weeks now and my skin seems to be reacting very well. I haven't had a serious breakout since I started and my skin seems to be healing better and faster. I just have two questions that I hope someone can answer for me.

1. A lot of people talk about double-cleansing but after seeing the results of plain oil cleansing, I'm kind of afraid of using normal cleansers again. I don't wear make-up so the only thing I usually have on my face is sunscreen, which an oil cleanser can remove on it's own. So if I oil cleanse with an oil containing an emulsifier that allows the oil to mix with water and rinse off, is a second cleanse with a gentle water based cleanser necessary?
2. If oil cleansing can allegedly remove things like sebum and dead skin cells, is it still necessary to do my weekly exfoliation?

[Acne] What is causing this??,"I don't need a diagnoses (Obviously!) But I've LITERALLY never suffered with acne until I became an adult and it's so frustrating, especially when I wash my face every night but when I wake up sometimes it's worse so I'm questioning if what I do at night isn't helping. 

My morning is usually very light, I just cleanse with water, mist with rose water and put on a moisturizer. At night I cleanse with African black soap, a witch hazel rose water toner and then apple cider vinegar as a second toner I guess, then occasionally an oil (Coconut, argan, castor). I've always used these products so I don't know why recently it's been an issue. But it seems like when I take a break from them, nothing bad happens and things get a but better for a little. Is my skin just getting used to them and I need to switch up? How do I determine what thing it is that my skin is freaking out about?

Is there any point continuing the PIH skincare routine or would I be better off switching over until I can get to the doctor again and get a different treatment?

My current skincare is either:

- foaming face wash or cleanser
- Clearasil rapid action pads on the worst bits of acne
- The Ordinary Lactic Acid in Simple moisturiser (one drop in fifteen mls) or rosehip oil
- Factor 50 sunscreen

I've ordered Ambi-fade for the PIH and would have been integrating this into my skincare routine but it hasn't arrived yet. I also have a tea-tree face mask that I use occasionally. Is there anything here that will aggravate my skin? What else can I do to help it?",1571737056.0,1.0,1

[acne] New change in routine,"[my skin today](https://imgur.com/gallery/s0eW08f)

All my life I have had very clear skin and probably only two pimples which went away very quickly. Then last September I started uni and my skin started breaking out - not cystic acne but about 5-10 spots on my face, mainly on my forehead and cheek and they left a red mark for weeks after they’d disappeared. I thought it was because I was very stressed at uni and not taking good care of myself - lack of sleep, extremely depressed and too much caffeine etc. 

In January I left uni and focused on myself and went to therapy, started eating healthier, used skincare for the first time in my life. But nothing really changed and my face always has about 5 spots, still on my forehead and cheek and now closed comedones everywhere. I’ve been through a few different skincare routines but right now I’ve been using a 5% glycolic acid tonic and Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising gel, with occasional overnight use of benzoyl peroxide on the bad spots. I also wash my face with soap in the shower and this has seemed to help a little bit with the amount of spots I get. But this routine has left my skin really dry and sore and obviously isn’t working on my acne.

I feel bad complaining because I know my skin isn’t as bad as what other people have to deal with but it really affects my mental health as my body image is low anyway. I’ve been thinking about focusing on rehydrating my skin and abandoning all the drying products - specifically I’ve been looking into buying the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturiser as well as some sort of SPF product (currently I use none which I know is bad, especially when using glycolic acid) and just sticking with these three products. I’m going on holiday in two weeks and I’d love for my skin to be better by then as I’m getting some professional photos taken.

Any help? Am I going down completely the wrong route? Any products which would work better? Thanks",1571734316.0,1.0,6

[acne] not sure what to do about acne,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some advice. First of all I just want to say I'm new to this sub but honestly the amount of resources is just incredible so thank you! I'll be sure to search around for specific product recommendations, I guess this post is more about whether to go back to a professional or not (I have some products in mind, recommendations still welcome though). Basically I've had acne for a long time but I've only recently been getting into skincare and I really want to start clearing up my skin. The acne on my face has been around since puberty (I'm 19 now), over the last year or so I've been struggling with body acne as well. I have yet to sort out a good routine so at the moment I am only using:

Clinique cleansing balm to take off makeup

Neutrogena Extra Gentle cleanser

Neutrogena oil-free moisture for sensitive skin/the one with spf if I'm going outside (I know it's only spf 15, still on the hunt for a good sunscreen and I think I might try some of the ones recommended in this sub!)

My skin type is combination and quite sensitive (oily t zone but also dry/flaky patches occasionally, thinking of adding in hyaluronic acid to hydrate). Not sure how much detail to go into but on my face and upper back I get quite big pimples though not cysts (so whiteheads I guess?), on my upper arms and thighs I get much smaller, really tiny inflamed bumps (doctor said this was acne mixing with keratosis pilaris, thinking of getting the Cerave SA bodywash and moisturizer for that)

I have been to my doctor and also a dermatologist who have recommended isotretinoin/accutane but I'm honestly terrified of the side effects. From what I've gathered accutane is only prescribed in the USA when things like antibiotics and topicals have failed, that's not the case where I live, I haven't tried any other acne treatment yet. I went back to my doctor and asked what other she options there are. She has her own cosmetic clinic on the side through which she sells products by a brand called Aspect Dr and recommended the [Problem Skin serum](https://i.imgur.com/JQ5X3Kn.png) and [AHA/BHA cleanser](https://i.imgur.com/9wuBQzJ.png). I had a look at the products and while ""all natural"" they are full of fragrance, essential oils, a bunch of citrus extracts... I feel like they would be way too harsh for me and am honestly kind of confused that a doctor would recommend those products, or is it just me? I'm kind of stuck on where to go next, should I try out the products my doctor recommends anyway, or just try and figure out a good routine on my own? I'm thinking I could find some less irritating (and much less expensive) products with AHA/BHA if that's the right kind of thing for me, or benzyl peroxide,  or retinol? Is it worth going back to a dermatologist (maybe they can recommend products)?

Honestly when I look at myself barefaced and see all my acne I worry that I should have just gone on the accutane, but then just thinking about it makes me anxious. I can always try it if nothing else works right?  Ugh this whole skin thing has been so stressuful. Sorry this post is kind of vague, I hope it made sense and any advice is welcome.",1571723826.0,0.5,6

A. CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser: This cleanser seems to have really good reviews, but I've heard that it can cause bad breakouts. 

B. La Roche-Posay Toleriane Face Wash Cleanser: Also very well-reviewed, though many people have said this cleanser is very light to the point it almost does not help your skin. 

C. InstaNatural Vitamin C Facial Cleanser: This cleanser seems to have the most chance to really help ...or really hurt.

[Sun Care] Sensitive eyes and sunscreen,"hello from sunny Australia - sorry i am on my phone

i’ve been trying to religiously put sunscreen on my face but i’m finding that most sunscreens i’ve used (pharmacy purchased to be specific) have really caused my eyes to shit themselves. my eyes just sting like all hell and i get severe light sensitivity so i end up lying down with a cold and wet face towel on my head for sometimes up to an hour and then i just sit in a dark room.

i’ve found the only way to avoid the eye sensitivity is to avoid my eye area. 

sunscreens i’ve tried are:

Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ - i have eczema on my eye lids so the alcohol in this dries my eyes out more and makes them sting

Cancer Council Face Day Wear Moisturiser Matte SPF 50+ - my eyes burn and i am blinded and light hurts

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50 - burns like the CC 

Mecca To Save Face SPF50+ - this is the only one i’ve found that doesn’t sting my eyes but the price tag 😕

also not sure if i should mention but yes i am going to see a doctor about light sensitivity because it seems fairly severe if it causes me to react so harshly to sunlight. also i have noticed that this reaction occurs when i use these sunscreens.",1571715359.0,1.0,6

AM: 
Clinique liquid cleanser mild- I really am liking this cleanser, doesn't leave me feeling dry or irritated and gets my makeup and whatever else off!

[Skin Concerns] NSFW -Hyperpigmentation from bikini waxing,"Over the last couple years I've (20F) been doing at home waxing around the bikini line and sometimes the whole area. My skin is somewhat prone to in-grown hairs and other sensitivity issues. Because of this I've had occasional folliculitus and ingrown hairs that, once removed, healed but left darkened areas on my fair skin. Now that I only shave and exfoliate more regularly most of my issues have subsided, but now I have all this uneven coloration.

What's the best routine/product to help with my hyperpigmentation? Retinol cream? A mild chemical peel? I'm very new to learning about skincare products and since it's a sensitive area I know I need to be careful so I don't know where to start.",1571703493.0,1.0,3

[Review] LRP Cicaplast Mains: a non-goopy occlusive,"La Roche Posay’s Cicaplast Mains is a hand cream (sold in Europe and Canada), but lately I’ve been using it on my face as an occlusive with great results.

It comes out as an ointment similar to petrolatum-based products (Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe Ointment, etc.) but when it glides on, the effect is much less shiny than petrolatum and much less tacky as well. It also has somewhat of a pore-minimizing effect (probably on account of the dimethicone). When I wear this, my skin becomes so bouncy and plumped and moist, and it stays that way all day—signatures of a good occlusive!

I highly recommend this as an alternative to petrolatum if you don’t like slug-lyfin’. This works especially well as a day occlusive. I don’t find I need to use additional lotion/cream under it either, since it’s “hydrating” (water + glycerin humectant) and emollient (fatty alcohols and shea butter)—so this is a 3-in-1 product for me. Bonus: It has 4% niacinamide!

(Side note: I’m prone to breakouts and this has not exacerbated any problems for me. I’m one of those unfortunate people who get closed comedones from CeraVe-in-the-tube and CeraVe PM, so this may be worth trying if you’re in the same boat.)

[Product Question] First time taking birth control (Diane-35),"Hi!

I am a 19-year-old girl who has struggled with acne since I was about 15 or 16 years old. I've tried Tactupump/Epiduo for about 2 years but my acne has remained persistent :( Since my acne is always the worst around the time of my period (hormonal) my doctor wants to put me on Diane-35. I've literally never taken any type of contraceptive before or any oral medication for acne as a matter of fact so I was wondering what your guyses experiences were like with this BC?

Also, how long does it show results/clearing of my skin because I am visiting my long-distance boyfriend next week and I plan on starting the pill tomorrow. Will I have to wait a while for results to show or is it pretty immediate? Just curious to know what the experience was like for the first few days/weeks taking Diane-35...

[Routine help] Tackling fine lines around eyes and red capillaries/veins around nose area?,"Hi everyone!

I recently came across this sub and read all the available materials, and also tried searching the group for similar concerns, but failed to find any.

I am 24 y/o and for the majority of my life have struggled with fine lines under my eyes - moisturizing doesn't seem to help, as any product applied visibly creases around this area.

I also struggle with redness (broken veins/capillaries) around my nostrils, and ideally I would like to make this redness disappear so I could feel confident to go bare-skinned more often!

My current routine consists of face wash and moisturizer (not water-based, as those seem to dry out my skin!), and I would say I have normal/combination skin that dries out significantly more during the winter months.

I am considering introducing Vitamin C into my routine (as well as sunscreen!), but I would greatly appreciate any and all advice that would help me tackle the issues at hand.

[Acne] Breaking Out w/ Differin After Moisturizing??,"I have been using Differin for 2 years and when I first started, I never moisturized my face after.
Within the past month, I have started moisturizing afterwards. However, I am also breaking out. I have tried so many moisturizers, but no matter what I use, I find new acne when I wake up. I can’t just give up on moisturizing. My face needs it.
I would really appreciate any help. Here is my routine in order: 

1. Clean face with Garnier Micellar Water on a exfoliating cotton pad.
Rinse off with lukewarm water.
2. Apply Benton Snail Bee High Content Skin Toner with a soft cotton pad.
-Wait until dry. 
3. Apply Differin Gel 
4. Apply Prosacea 
-Wait 1 hour. 
5. Mix together the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence and Skin 1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule.
Pat all over face. 
-Wait 30 minutes.
6. Moisturize with either the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream, Bioderma Sensibio Light, Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream, Vanicream, or CeraVe in the tub. 


I know that the Neutrogena Hydro Boost, Bioderma Sensibio, Soon Jung, and Vanicream aren’t fungal acne safe. However, I took Fluconazole a few days ago to see if the acne would go away or if new acne would stop forming. It didn’t, so that rules out fungal acne. 
The CeraVe is fungal acne safe, but also breaks me out and burns my face so so badly. I turn beet red after using it. 
The Differin should be preventing the acne from occurring, but it stopped working once I started moisturizing. What else can I do? Will switching to tretinoin help?",1571696868.0,1.0,6

What you can't see is that there are little tiny lines, like wrinkles all over my cheeks but they're not regular wrinkles if that makes sense. It's like my skin is so dry, it's taut. I try to keep it as moisturized as possible but it stays the same. 

My doc recommended I use Vanicream products - I use Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser for AM/PM and Vanicream Lite Lotion afterward for both AM/PM on my forehead. I use metrogel on my cheeks for AM/PM. I also use L'Oreal Revitalift (I feel like that's a dirty word here lol) eye cream for AM/PM.

I feel like I need to ramp things up or change things or something because my skin is aging and I can tell and I'm really hating the combination of wrinkles and spots. If anyone has any helpful tips, I'd really appreciate it!

"[Routine Help] After a terrible breakout, I need help optimizing my current routine to fight PIE, dryness, and closed comedones.","Hi everyone! I’ve been a loooong time lurker (like, since 2014) and finally got the nerve to post. I hope I've formatted this correctly. 

**The issue(s):** 

I had a pretty bad acne breakout back in April 2019 when I went off Spiro to try more ""natural"" alternatives (bad idea). A few moves and job stress didn’t help either. Now, I’m back on Spiro and my skin has calmed down a LOT. I haven't had a breakout in a few weeks :) 

I also realized I may have some sensitivities to silicones, because when I stoped using my very silicone-y sunscreen (Cotz), I also stopped breaking out as much. My current routine is silicone-free. 

I’ve had fungal acne in the past—diagnosed by a dermatologist—so I also try to avoid fungal acne triggers as well! 

I need some help figuring out how to get rid of leftover PIE, deal with lingering closed comedones, and combat some dryness. My skin feels PARCHED right now and I haven’t been able to find a moisturizer that is silicone-free, FA safe, and moisturizing enough. 

Here are my questions: 

* Are there any glaring mistakes in my routine that may be exacerbating my skin concerns?
* I’ve looked into incorporating a vitamin C serum—would you all recommend this? 
* Do you have any recos for a moisturizer that is FA safe and silicone-free? I’ve thought about the Sidmool Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Sleeping Pack or the Krave Oat So Simple Water Cream to use at night. 
* Are there any other ingredients that I should try to incorporate right now? 
* I still have closed comedones around my chin, despite using adapalene. Should I consider introducing an AHA to my active rotation? Or switching to tret? 

**Skin type:** Combination–definitely more dry than oily with the season change though! 

**Location:** North Carolina 

**Current routine:** 

AM: 

* Cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio H20 or Dr. Eddie’s Happy Cappy shampoo a couple times a week (for fungal acne maintenance)  
* A few times a week - [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) BP short contact therapy on any active pimples (wash off after 3 mins) 
* A’pieu Madecassoside Ampoule for redness
* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid (not totally FA safe but it doesn’t make me break out) 
* Sidmool Madagascar Real Moisture Cream (this is fine, but doesn’t seem to moisturize very well)
* Sunscreen: A’pieu Soo Boo Ji Cotton SPF50+ PA++++ 

PM: 

* Cleanse with Vanicream
* A’pieu Madecassoside Ampoule for redness
* Actives (on rotation—I try to give my skin a break from actives at least 3 days out of the week): 
   * Adapalene 0.3% 
   * GOW Azelaic Acid 8% 
* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid 
* Sidmool Madagascar Real Moisture Cream
* Timeless Squalane

Specifically, it says to use it up within 3 months of opening (old bottle said 6 months) AND it says to refrigerate after opening (old bottle said ""store in a cool, dry place""). This is pretty crazy to me. It makes it seem like the granactive retinoid is not as stable as they claim, if it has to be used up so quickly and also refrigerated?!

[Product Question] Snail Mucin and Carcinogens,"So great product...concern over the preservative for Cosrx.


So this product is instantly moisturizing and I love the texture and use it in conjunction with my other water based serums to boost thief effects. My issue is the two ingredients they used to make this product. Phenoxyethanol is a common personal care preservative. It is an effective bactericide and has recently been widely used to replace parabens, especially in natural products. Phenoxyethanol has been found to be toxic to the body even in small doses.
In order to create it, the known skin carcinogen, ethylene oxide is combined with a phenol (a chemical compound which is also considered a carcinogen). The process of creating phenoxyethanol may (depending on each manufacturer’s production methods) produce the dangerous by- product called 1,4 dioxane. The EPA has established 1,4 dioxane is a probable human carcinogen. The FDA describes it as being able to depress the nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea. The product’s Material Safety Data Sheet says that it is harmful if inhaled or swallowed or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The Chemical Toxicity Database lists that phenoxyethanol may cause central nervous system depression, kidney damage, skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness. If inhaled it may cause respiratory and digestive tract irritation. Japan has banned the use of it in all cosmetics",1571667580.0,0.5,8

"[Routine Help] Acne prone, oily skin Skincare routine, need help: Ordinary, Roche Possay, Hylamide","Hey,

i have been struggling with acne and oily skin for years now (I am male, asian, have scars from acne and 21 years old), and probably tried every skincare product there is, but I cant seem to find the right products.

This is my current skincare routine:

\- everything with an ""x"" is what I am gonna start using (just ordered them)

\- everything with an ""a"" is what im not using everyday but rather every 2nd 3rd day of the week, since I feel like it would be too much for my skin

AM

&#x200B;

1. Random Cleanser for oily skin
2. Poor Flush (x) (Hylamide)
3. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (The ordinary)
4. Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (x) (The ordinary)
5. Effaclar SPF 30 (Roche possay, though im not sure if I get oily from this, might have to try a bit longer. Are their SPF 50 products better? like: **ANTHELIOS XL,** LSF 50+ ?)
6. Poor Delete (x) (a) (Hylamide)

PM

&#x200B;

1. Random Cleanser for oily skin
2. REN AHA Ready Steady Glow (a)
3. Poor Flush (x) (Hylamide)
4. Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (The ordinary)
5. Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (x) (The ordinary)

My questions:

&#x200B;

1. Should I add something with a vitamin A? (Retinol or Retinoid by the ordinary (Maybe: Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion)? If so, what are the differences between Retinol and Retinoid? I tried researching, but I dont really get it lol)
2. If I add something with vitamin A, should I stop using any products? In particular stop with ""REN AHA Ready Steady Glow""? I heard its not good to mix AHA with any vitamin a. If that is true, should I stop one, or could I do AHA in the morning and vitamin a in the evening? or both every second day and not everyday?
3. Is my current skincare too much for my skin? If I need changes, what are those?
4. Should I change the Effaclar SPF 30 with **ANTHELIOS XL,** LSF 50+ ? I feel like it gets my skin a bit oily, but im not sure, since I haven't used it with any moisturiser (it may be from my skin having no moisturiser and thus over oiling?), because it will arrive this week with the other products marked with an ""x"")

So recently my skin has been terrible lately and I suddenly have a break out of all of these tiny invisible bumps on the side of my face that could almost be pimples but I'm unsure. I have always had clear skin (no acne) but have struggled with diffused redness on my skin. I generally have a good diet, cleanse and use skincare daily but I am wondering if some of the following factors have influenced my skin problems recently and whether any of you could help me to fix these issues!

Over the past two months;

\- I hardly drink any water daily

\- mental health has declined and have been really stressed and down

\- stopped using acids before bed (lactic and retinol) because I ran out lol

\- exfoliating more than usual

\- sleeping regularly and eating well (no heavy meals, no candy etc)

\- drinking more alcohol than usual?

\- have been off the contraceptive pill

Again, my issues aren't acne, but I am horrified with the texture and how dry and tired my skin appears to be. I have an idea that my moisture barrier may be damaged and I'm thinking I should just book in with a dermatologist, but I would love to hear your thoughts.

Sorry for all of the info!

[Personal] Did I just burn my skin with The Ordinary AHA/BHA Peel?,"I have been using The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling solution for about 4 weeks now (once every week) and I havent had any major tingling or burning sensation or redness even in the first application. I have been using it for 10 mins.

However, last night, I applied it for the 4th time. And it didnt go as smoothly as before. I had quite a lot of tingling sensation but I thought it was normal and I kept the peel on for about 8 mins, by that time, the sensation was getting quite heavy so I washed of my face. The skin on one of my cheeks, where the tingling sensation was most intense had these patches with fresh burnt skin like texture. Slightly white and shiny. I washed my face off with cool water. After washing, there was much burning sensation or anything. It just looked bad. 

After about an hour or so, I checked again and now my skin was normal. Those patches had disappeared. So I went on with my routine, applied some Alpha Arbutin and then moisturizer on top and went to bed. All seemed fine.

However, in the morning, the areas which had burning sensation when I had applied the peel and had that fresh burnt skin after washing, are not turned dark red/brown. Its really worrying me now. There is no burning sensation or pain. These spots are just there. I have applied moisturizer and sun screen.

I have no idea what caused this sudden reaction even thought I have applied this peel several times before without any issue. Any help will be highly appreciated.

[Routine Help] Is there anything glaringly wrong or missing from my skin routine?,"My (26F) skin type is combination / dry with the occasional hormonal, cystic acne breakout around period time. I live in the UK, so dry skin is quite a concern of mine, and something I deal with especially since I use retinol in my routine. 

I am currently struggling with these small white head / comedonal acne around my chin/cheek area. I'm not too sure what this is from, and am a bit afraid of experimentally adding in or taking away from my current routine for the risk of making it worse. At the moment it's not at all noticeable (only to me and then others when I pick at it).

My primary concern at the moment is anti-aging. I am quite an expressive person and have started developing lines on my forehead and around my eyes from laughing. These lines aren't fully set in my skin yet, and I'm trying to prevent that from happening as long as I can.

[Product Question] Just switched from PC 2% bha to PC 4% bha. Experiences?,"Long time lurker, first time posting!!! 😊 I’ve been using PC 2% bha and PC 8% aha every night for 8-10 weeks to combat the SFs that have lived on my nose since I was 12 (I just turned 40 so like 28 years now). I’m not gonna lie, I was expecting a miracle cure and it never came. In fact, I’ve seen little to no change in that time using this combo. So tonight I started PC 4% bha to see if it helps more. Any experiences with this stronger formulation?  Or suggestions on my routine? My skin is quite oily, used to get dehydrated super easily, until I found my hyaluronic acid and moisturizing routine. 

For reference, my routine for the last 2 months (suggestions, please!!!):

AM:

Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash (I wake up sweaty so water won’t cut it)

Thayers Rose Petal Toner

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Serum w/Hyaluronic Acid

TO Niacinamide/Zinc Serum

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gel Cream w/Hyaluronic Acid

Sunscreen (still shopping around, I was never good about sunscreen until this sub) : Olay Complete spf 30, or Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture with spf 30, or CeraVe AM—don’t love any of them

Elf Poreless Primer and make-up (powder, no liquid foundation)


PM:

Garnier Micellar Water or Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Cleansing Gel to remove make-up

Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash

Thayers Rose Petal Toner

PC 2% bha (4% as of tonight) and PC 8% aha

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Serum w/Hyaluronic Acid

TO Niacinamide/Zinc Serum

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gel Cream w/Hyaluronic Acid

Rosehip Seed Oil mixed with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion

Every 7-10 Days: TO 30% aha/2% bha peeling mask

Routine has helped my occasional acne come to a head and clear up much faster, but hasn’t done squat to my SFs and blackheads. 

So tonight I switched to 4% bha...
I gave a squeeze to this particular blackhead above my eyebrow that’s been driving me crazy for months. I’ve squeezed this mofo 1000 times and nothing, nada, ZIP! (I know, I know, but it’s just the one and I’m gentle).  I seriously almost peed my pants when the damn thing came out just now. In 3 hours it went from a flat blackhead to a raised/pimple type blemish after applying the 4% for the first time. And a tiny squeeze got me this huuuuuuge hard sebum plug that was never ending.  Just crazy long, idk how that much was in there. And it’s been there for 4-6 months and never budged until I used the 4% bha tonight!!

[acne] Hormonal acne caused by egg donation/fertility treatment?,"Been battling with acne for almost 20 years (29yo now), but for last few years it's been smoother sailing, mostly just texture-issues and occasional (probably fungal) flare-ups. Things got tremendously better 2 years ago when I switched my contraceptive method from pills to patch.

Until all hell broke loose when I donated eggs a few weeks ago. I started the ovarian stimulation injections about 6 weeks ago and the collection was 4 weeks ago - the process is pretty similar to first steps of IVF-treatment, if you're familiar with that. For the last two weeks, my skin has been flipping out: deep cysts on jawline and both sides of nose, tens of small pimples in forehead - the whole awesomeness. I passed it over as fungal first, but Nizoral didn't help, which led me to think it might be from the hormonal treatment, even if it didn't start right away with injections. 

While I definitely do not regret donating, it kinda makes me want to call the clinic and ask them to tell the recipient parents (anonymous donation) that while my other genes might be great, I may have given their kid the worst possible skin genes. ""Just dip her/his face to snail mucin and send them to SCA when it's time"", haha.

"[Product Question] Just started using an AHA to help with my hyper-pigmentation, but I have a few questions","So I recently purchased ""The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution"" to help get rid of my hyper-pigmentation. I also have been using the ""Clean&Clear 3-in-1 foaming wash"" which contains salicylic  acid before bed. My question is whether or not it would be safe to use the AHA after using this face wash, or will it be too harsh on my skin? The lady at the store said that it may be too harsh, but I understand people here use AHAs and BHAs together, so I think it shouldn't be a problem right? I don't have sensitive skin and used the AHA once so far and experienced no problems.

In addition, since I experienced very little discomfort when using the AHA, is it okay if I were to use it daily (of course I will be wearing sunscreen when going out) as I really want to get rid of the hyper-pigmentation.

Lastly, can anyone share there experiences with this AHA. I have dark skin and am trying to get rid of the dark marks left behind from acne so i'm really looking forward to using this AHA due to alot of the praise it seems to get on this sub!!",1571630064.0,0.67,4

[Acne] red wine spot treatment wow,"It minimized my pimples so much after one use and made my emerging pimples disappear. It’s been three days and my breakouts are almost gone (it may have minimized pih/scarring but that might just be in my head) I’m impressed. I tried it before as a mask and it was irritating but its perfect as a spot treatment on a q-tip. Stings a little for few seconds. I’m not sure I can recommend it but I think it can be good if you have nothing on hand or are looking for something new to try and not much has worked. If you’re concerned about harsh treatments this would probably be something to give a try in terms of chemicals. It may irritate but it’s safe for most people when it comes to allergies. Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin folk I for sure misused it the first time but I know some people like to be extra about things anyway . I have strong non-sensitive skin. Proceed at your own risk. A diluted spot treatment may be okay for some. It worked for me it might work for you.

I've recently been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Salicylic Acid Acne Fighting Face Wash twice a day. I wash in the morning and I wash at night.

The appearance of my acne has gotten a lot better, but at the cost of my skin getting considerably drier. I moisturize with Cetaphil Moisturing Lotion at night and I moisturize with Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion 30 SPF in the morning.

[Product Question] Can an OTC Retinol be stronger than Curology Tretinoin .009?,"I just received my trial prescription of Curology last week and have been using it daily since Thursday (recommended M-W-F but the low dose made me decide to go all in).

The formula is: Tretinoin .009% / Azelaic Acid 9% / Clindamycin 1%

Previously I was using Skinceuticals .3 Retinol

The only different I've made is the Skinceuticals I would apply fairly soon after the shower (still moist skin). The Curology isn't immediately after washing my face but I'll still apply a small amount of fluid to help glide the product on my skin (usually just the Evian water spray but have used a hydrating toner).

I am 32/F and was looking for Curology as an anti-aging/treating hyperpigmentation. I have a fair complexion with a lot of sun damage. With the Skinceuticals retinol I feel like I was making progress but wanted to try a Tretinoin product over the winter and see how my skin handles it. I've been on the Skinceuticals for 2 months now and still have been dealing with flakiness but since I stopped one and started the other my flakiness went away and I'm just assuming it's a weaker product. Is that possible? I was afraid of trying tretinoin before going on vacation later this week but at this point I'm already planning on packing it and continuing to use it daily.

Has anyone experienced this while trying curology since the starting % is so much lower? I already planned on asking to remove the clindamycin and am thinking to see if they'd either up the tretinoin or just go to the .5 formula in Skinceuticals.",1571610039.0,0.67,4

[Routine Help] [Acne] Antibiotic-related fungal acne? New products? What is wrong with my face!,"I’ve been on my skincare journey for a little over a year now. I saw significant improvement about a month after switching up my routine last fall and was very pleased. I maybe got one pimple a month around my period that would heal pretty quickly. 

Old routine:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel
* Rohto Melano CC
* Simple Rich Moisturizer
* Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 50
* Smashbox Camera Ready CC Cream

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel 
* The Ordinary Mandelic Acid/Stridex Red box pads (switch off between nights)
* FAB Ultra Repair Cream
* The Ordinary Argan Oil
* Vaseline (inconsistent use, only when feeling very dry)

Fast forward to spring 2019. I went on really harsh antibiotics for latent tuberculosis and everything was fine right up until I finished my treatment. The last month or so I went to Europe and started using some product samples while I was there and noticed a slight uptick in CCs on my forehead. I returned to my old routine when I got home but things just got worse from there. By August my forehead was a war zone, small CCs everywhere with a couple inflamed ones at any given time. After doing some research I thought this might be FA from the harsh antibiotics so I started doing Nizoral masks and taking probiotics to try to get my own microbiome back full force. My face would look improved in the morning but then progressively worse by the end of the day so I decided I would never know if it was fungal unless I actually changed my whole routine to be FA safe. What a pain that was. It took me about a month and a half to completely change it because I didn’t want to change everything at once to make sure I wasn’t reacting to any particular product, but this is my new routine (bolded are new products): 

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* **Banana Boat Kids Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50**
* **Supergoop!CC Cream Daily Correct**

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* **Simple Foaming Cleanser**
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* Stridex Red box pads (about every other night or so)
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* Vaseline (inconsistent, only when feeling very dry)

Sometimes I’ll do a Nizoral Mask on nights I don’t use the Stridex pads. I’ve been using this entire routine for about 3 weeks now and I honestly just don’t know anymore. I still have a ton of CCs on my forehead. The rest of my face is ok, a couple breakouts here and there but nothing compared to my forehead. It’s really only one half of my forehead too, which I straight up don’t get. I’ll have one day a week where I think, hm maybe it’s actually starting to calm down. Then I wake up the next day to new small CCs and some of the old ones have become inflamed. What’s really irritating is even after coming to a head and healing, the same spot turns right back into a CC that becomes inflamed again a week later. It’s really taken a toll on my confidence and I’m just at a total loss with what to do. Even before I started my routine last fall my face was never this bad. The only conclusion I can draw are the antibiotics but I’ve been off them for nearly 4 months now and been taking probiotics for 2 months and nothing seems to be working. Anyone experience anything similar or have any advice? I’m desperate!",1571602737.0,0.5,8
"[Routine Help] My skin changed so much, not sure what to do...","Hi.  
In the past 3 years, I have been struggling with acne and have tried different things until I found something that was kind of working. Recently I have travelled for +1 month to South Asia and then South-East Asia and because of the humidity and the high temperature, I have based my skincare on washing my face with a cleanser and applying moisturiser. I have been drinking insane amounts of water and a week into my trip, my skin was clear, plump and with a healthy glow. I am back home now, things are looking pretty good, with an odd small spot here and there, but nothing major as before. I am now looking to clear my face of acne scars and smoothen the texture, but I am not sure what to do in relation to my skincare as I am scared of using anything again as right now my skin is at its best, but also I am worried that if I don't use the products that helped me, I will go back to acne.

Current routine:

***AM***  
\- TO Glycolic Acid Toner  
\- The Body Shop Elderflower Eye Gel  
\- ELF Hello Hydration Face Cream  
\- (Altruist 50SPF Suncream - but not as much now. I know! :( )  
\- NYX Honey Dew Me Up (make-up primer)

***PM***  
\- The Body Shop Himalayan Charcoal Soap  
\- TO Glycolic Acid Toner / TO AHA BHA Peeling Solution (every week or so)  
\- TO Niacinamide / TO Hyaluronic Acid (if I do the peel)  
\- ELF Hello Hydration Face Cream  
\- Vichy Mineral 89

I have recently started to use TO Salicylic Acid and TO 100% Squalane as well, but I am not sure yet when/where to include them. Sadly I can't really do oils, but would love to try some retinoids or Vitamin C.

My previous routine looked a bit different, I can share if you think that would help. Can you please help me in identifying what products to use for texture smoothing and getting rid of acne scars? I am also trying to find a good night cream. Thank you.",1571601305.0,1.0,3

"using neutrogena alcohol free toner for years, seeking replacement for added moisture [routine help]","My face skin is thin, sensitive, and very prone to dryness. If it gets wet in the shower, it dries out and even gets flaky. This is with warm, not hot water, just running down my face somewhat. I've just been using toner and unscented moisturizer on it for years with okay results. There is still some dryness I feel like might be improved with a more moisturizing, still gentle toner, if I can find it. So far, I've just wasted my money. I have used witch hazel in multiple variations, as well as non-natural brands, and it all does bad things to my skin. This toner is good, but it does create massive shine (not oily just weird) and some dryness, usually on my forehead. 

Even when I did OCM, I seem to have broken the moisture barrier on my skin as it created many crinkly dehydration lines while somehow also leaving my skin feeling weirdly greasy and tight. I guess because it is so thin and sensitive, it can't handle much of anything without reacting negatively and usually those fun dehydration lines that cannot be resolved with moisturizer or oil. For years, I was doing fun experiments with various wipes, toners, cleansers, etc, and it all fucked my skin up worse. Reaching out here in case someone has similar issues and another toner worked better than mine. 

 Currently dealing with dehydration lines that i suspect is from occasionally using cerave sa cleanser (that promised to retain my moisture barrier) and my face often feels tight. Fun!

[Skin Concern] [Personal] Girlfriend lost it after she saw my neurotermatitis feet,"Hello Reddit,

I have neurodermatitis on my hands and feet. It’s much worse on my feet tho (see picture), although it really only comes out during winter but usually some cortisone creme fixes it. 

When my girlfriend (of 2+ years) saw my feet today, she completely lost it. 

She is really deep in the whole skincare thing and easily spends thousands on beauty products, cremes and what not. Her daily routine consists of 15 cremes, sprays, oils and anything else that allows you to smear on your body. 

I am fine with all that, I even pay for some of her products, lotion her entire body up every day (which obviously is a mutually beneficial thing since of course I love touching her, so I’m not complaining about that) and to be fair, she does looks damn near flawless. However I don’t use any cremes & stuff. I barely manage to put sunscreen on my face every now and then. 

Anyway, back to topic:
She told me my feet look disgusting and DANGEROUS (she literally said “dangerous”) and that I need a pedicure IMMEDIATELY(!) because according to her it looks like my foot is about to “fall off”. 

I think this is her skincare craze speaking and that she is overreacting. I have had this condition for 28 years and I’m fine, I never died from having dry skin. 

So please be honest: Do I really need a 60€ pedicure and is my life really in danger or should I just put creme on it like I did the past 28 years?


TLDR; Girlfriend sees my life in danger because I have dry skin, I think she’s a bit overreacting.

The routine also seems to get rid of existing zits pretty quickly, but it doesnt stop new ones from coming at all. I have tried cleansing both once and twice a day. I have tried using BP both once and twice a day. I moisturize twice a day and I use an SPF 55 sunscreen every day. I just have no clue as to why I seem to get a new pimple every morning. They can sometimes occur on my forehead and mouth, but most of them are around my cheeks and especially my chin area. They are also usually inflamed and leave marks despite me never picking them. I just forgot what it feels like to have skin without a new blemish popping up when I wake up. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Current AM routine:

Wash face with water

Vanicream Lite Lotion

Neutrogena Breakout-Free SPF 55 Sunscreen

Current PM routine:

"How to deal with aging for thin, dry, sensitive skin [anti-aging]","I'm 32, and despite going heavy on the sunscreen forever, am showing a lot more fine lines than friends my age. I feel like it's because I'm very pale and naturally run pretty dry. 

I've got Botox a few times which helped around the forehead and crows feet, but it's too expensive for me to keep up with and I'm still painfully aware of the ageing around my lips and even neck/decolletage. 

I'm interested in trying a tretinoin or retinoid or something, but I'm worried that all the peeling etc will do more harm than good. I chatted briefly with my botox lady about my routine, and she was said I have thin skin and should stop with even my mild AHA gel. 

I'm getting kinda self conscious with how I look and I really don't want it to continue degrading at this rate. Are there any tips or guides for people with my type of skin?

[Routine Help] Checking in after 5 months of a new routine and looking for more advice!,"I posted about 5 months back (in May). At the time I had virtually no skincare routine and had such bad habits that I rarely washed my face before bed and only washed in the AM. Here are photos of my face before I started a skincare routine: [https://imgur.com/a/8ZPGo8a](https://imgur.com/a/8ZPGo8a)

* It was a bit before summer started and I was getting freckly from the sun. Taking this photo actually made me a lot more aware of how delicate our skin is to sun damage, so although I am a beachbum, I made it a point to protect my face as well as I could this summer.

Fast forward 5 months, and I've slowly integrated new products into my skin and feel that the results have been pretty great! I haven't added all products recommended to me just yet, because I want to go slow enough to understand how my skin is reacting to each product. Here is my skin now in the same lighting: [https://imgur.com/a/bwvVPRg](https://imgur.com/a/bwvVPRg)

My routine now is:

**AM:**

Cleanse with Soap & Glory Deep Cleaning Milk

Cosrx Snail Mucin - 2 pumps

Melano CC Vitamin C - I am quite liberal with this and use 10-12 drops on my face

Drunk Elephant Protini Moisturizer

**PM:**

Same cleanser

Cosrx Snail Mucin - 2 pumps

The Ordinary Niacinamide (altho I've run out so it's been a week or so..)

Drunk Elephant Protini Moisturizer

Watermelon Glow Sleeping Mask a few nights a week (it's an AHA with glycerin)

SkinCeuticals Micro-Exfoliating Scrub - once a week

&#x200B;

When I initially posted 5 months ago, I was recommended to also use a Glycolic Acid Exfoliant in the AM, and Retinol/Tret at night. My question is - would you still recommend these products and if so, which should I introduce first? Also open to all product recommendations!!

[Acne] $70 worth of Amazon gift cards - what should I buy?,"I participated in a survey and received $70 in Amazon gift cards. Now the question is: what skincare products should I buy? I'm leaning towards shea butter but not sure what else to get. I have hormonal acne on my chin that I'm constantly battling so any advice for that would be great (I have an IUD so more birth control isn't an option). They're usually cystic in nature and pretty painful. Nothing I do seems to help (I change pillow cases, try not picking, use salicylic acid, use benzoyl peroxide (not at the same time as the acid), moisturize, use sunscreen, and use a new face cloth each time).

Routine:

AM:

* Splash face with water
* Use either benzoyl peroxide or clean and clear salicylic acid acid astringent
* Unscented lotion + body shop shea butter
* Cerave AM for sunscreen

PM:

* Coconut oil for makeup removal
* Clean and Clear salicylic acid again
* Sometimes the Ordinary's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
* Unscented lotion + body shop shea butter
* Vaseline for lips

I used to have very clear skin on my forehead - never had any issues. However the past few months I have seen so much acne on my forehead and it taking a toll on my self esteem and I am really in need of advise.
I’m not sure what kind of acne it is, I feel like it could be Fungal but it doesn’t really itch.

- La Roshe-Posay face wash at night and in the morning
- 10% benzoyl peroxide Clean and clear wash in effected areas at night
- Clindamycin / Tretinoin gel at night
- Aczone in the morning 
- Vanicream moisturizer in the morning and at night

I’ve seen a few people recommend Nizoral and azelaic acid? I’m open to any recommendations

Edit:
Things to note: 
- started a new job recently and stress level has been pretty high
- derm prescribed Clindamycin / Tretinoin gel around 8 months ago and worked amazing for about 6 months

[Skin Concern] I think I messed up by trying Cetaphil and now everything I use makes my face burn.,"So it’s exam season and also beginning to get cold here in Canada, which means my skin has started to break out. I usually get a few pimples between my eyebrows, near my hairline and under my bottom lip. I work at a pharmacy, and one of my pharmacists there recommended that I try a gentle cleanser, namely Cetaphil. 

I gave it a go before bed, but about 15 minutes later I noticed my face felt very dry and VERY itchy. Checked in the mirror, and my face was red and covered in hives, and I got a small semi-circle of pimples and super dry skin under my eyes. Stopped using the cleanser, but the dry spots and some of the pimples remain. 

Now, when I use my moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel) or my usual cleanser (Aveeno Ultra-Calming Facial Cleanser) it burns like HELL. I stopped using my toner as well, L’Oreal Witch Hazel Toner, because it just hurts too badly. 

Also to be noted: about 4 weeks ago I was a dummy and decided to try a whole bunch of new products in a new routine without patch testing and also introduced them all at once. Something was making my skin very bumpy and red, so I’ve quit all of them and have only been using the products listed above for 2 weeks now until I tried Cetaphil 4 days ago. 
The products I tried were: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence, Sephora Vitamin C+E Serum, and LaNeige Sleeping Mask. 

[TLDR]: Started using a whole load of products all at once, something was irritating so stopped. Tried Cetaphil facial cleanser, dried up my skin and gave me terrible pimples that won’t go away and now my regular facial wash and moisturizer burns my face.

[Skin Concern] Oily scalp,"Looking for advice. 

29, male.

I've been shaving my head daily for over a year with no issues. I started shaving my head as my hair began to thin and I didn't want to cling to it, so I generally have a pretty decent regrowth by the next day. But I don't generally get any irritation or anything of major concern from shaving.

The thing that drives me nuts is the amount of oil that my scalp seems to produce as the day progresses. It's not a huge or ridiculous amount, but it's noticeable. 

On an average day I've shaved by 7am and done my skincare routine, and by after midday it it's like i've visited the [shin-o ball-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVrbq8TtTo0). Generally when I'm out, people are always touching my head, and it's a little anxiety inducing when they first comment on how oily it is.

* Water Drench Cleanser 
* FIRMx Peeling Gel
*  Potent-C Power Eye Cream 

My skin felt moisturized, looked cleaner and had a glow to it. However, it was way out of my budget for the 4 products.

Extra Info: I wash my hair every day using Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp and condition with Pantene Super Food (I wear product in my hair so I need to remove it every morning from the day before), but none of this touches my face and I've been told in the past by my GP that my scalp isn't dry or anything.

I'm also taking a course of Oxytetracycline.

Looking for a Lip Definition and Fullness Preventative Treatment (non-surgical) [Anti-Aging],"Hi there! I work at a beauty store and am constantly putting lipstick on older women and their lack of lip definition is starting to give me nightmares. I never really feared getting older (I'm 30) besides crepey neck, but now I'm fearing loosing fullness and definition! So I'm looking for some preventative treatments that are non-surgical to keep this from happening.

I came across this (HIGH PERFORMANCE ANTI-AGING AND FILLER LIP TREATMENT) but saw some not amazing reviews (https://preview.tinyurl.com/violetgrey).

[Product Question] TO’s Natural Moisturizing Factors?,"Hi everyone! So I have dry skin, and have been using the neutrogena hydro boost water gel for years as my morning moisturizer. However, I’ve been looking for a silicone free moisturizer for a while, and I’m a big fan of other The Ordinary products, so I was interested in their moisturizer, the NMF. However a lot of the reviews for it claimed that it wasn’t moisturizing enough, and I was concerned that it wouldn’t be enough for my dry skin (even if I mixed in some Squalane oil, as TO’s website suggests). Anyone have any experience with this moisturizer who can help me out?",1571514846.0,0.86,23
