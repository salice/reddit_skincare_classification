"[Routine Help] I have oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. What anti-ageing products do you recommend?","Current routine as of today is cleansing with Clean & Clear deep action cream wash, then using Clean & Clear oil free dual action moisturiser and Heliocare oil free SPF 50. I am going through a good skin phase at the moment where it’s staying mostly clear and I find this routine is helping me maintain it, I have recently found out that if I use tons and tons of products my skin gets really irritated so simple routines are usually better for me. I used to use an endless list of things my skin actually doesn’t seem to need. 

Now my main goal is prevent signs of ageing. I have heard good things about The Ordinary retinol products and vitamin C in terms of preventing ageing. Do I apply it after moisturiser? I always used to apply a retinol product after my moisturiser has sunk in.",1570689811.0,1.0,1
"[Skin Concern] Skin was perfectly fine, then dry itches of irritated skin happened! I cannot reduce the redness","Hey guys as the title states I'm having redness around my face that won't go away. It's red, slightly irritated, dries out easily, and raised. I've had extremely sensitive skin for a while. I was on topical Accutane years ago for severe acne. I've applied mometasone to my ears for eczema and back of my neck? Here's a list of the routines I've tried... 

Pictures included:

&#x200B;

**Previous AM Routine 1:**

1. Cleanse with Cetaphil gentle cleanser
2. Apply eucerin AM cream

&#x200B;

**Previous PM Routine 1:**

1. Cleanse with cetaphil gentle cleaner
2. Apply eucerin night time urea cream
3. Apply vaseline extreme night time moisturizer

&#x200B;

This routine had no effect so I switched to a more basic approach.

**Routine 2:**

Literally just cleanse with water and keep reapplying aveeno daily moisturizing

&#x200B;

This routine helped reduce the redness by quite a bit, but didn't remove it completely so I switched it up again.

&#x200B;

**Routine 3 AM & PM Routine:**

1. Cleanse with water
2. Apply OR Hylauronic acid
3. Apply La Rosche a Posay Toleraine Ultra
4. Apply La Rosche a Posay Cicaplast
5. Apply Aquaphor

This routine the redness upped a bit, but not as bad as while on the urea cream.

Any suggestions? Going to make a derm appointment soon.",1570687285.0,1.0,2
"[Misc] Does it matter if a moisturizer ""absorbs""?","Hi all, long time lurker first-time-in-a-while poster,

I  see a lot of talk about moisturizers ""absorbing"" into the skin. I know  what it looks like for a moisturizer to absorb vs not absorb, but I  don't understand the mechanics of it. Does it make a difference whether I  massage moisturizer in until it absorbs, vs just leave it on the skin  as it is? (Apart from the fact that if I just leave it, it's a visible  white coating.)

Thanks!",1570684929.0,1.0,2
[routine help] introducing Lactic Acid or retinol,"I’m still learning about various actives. I have successfully incorporated Cerave Vitamin C serum into my routine over the past few months and have observed improvement in pigmentation. I’d now like to introduce an anti-aging active, I’m thinking The Ordinary 5% Lactic Acid to start with (and perhaps introducing retinol down the line, pending the results from LA). I’m not sure where to incorporate into my routine:

AM:
Water wash, Trader Joe’s rose water toner, Trader Joe’s rose hip facial oil

PM:
OCM wash, Rose water toner, Cerave Vitamin C serum, Cerave moisturizer cream 

I’d like to do the Lactic Acid at night but am not sure if it would play well with the Vitamin C? I prefer to do the Vit C at night since this formula is a little tacky feeling and I’ve read some comments here saying that it’s better at night anyway.

[Product Question] Tony Moly The chok chok green tea foam cleanser,"I just recently bought this product and I wanted to know if it's good for sensitive and acne prone skin, those are my main concerns. I've used other products from the brand and I heard some good reviews from this one. I would really appreciate your opinions of this product or even of the other products of the line :))))))))",1570679614.0,0.5,1
[Routine Help] How can I fit Vitamin C into my routine with BHA in the AM and Retinol in the PM?,"I've been trying to do the research, but I've been finding mixed answers. 

 For example [Paula's Choice](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/five-retinol-myths-busted.html)
> A recent study revealed two important facts: not only did retinol prove effective when paired with vitamin C, but the two worked beautifully together to defend skin against environmental assault when applied under a sunscreen.

Then you have [Huffpost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/skincare-ingredients-never-mix_n_5a6a0f59e4b06e253265821c)

> In general, she said to avoid combining the two ingredients. She recommends using a vitamin C serum in the morning and retinol cream at night “to ensure full efficacy of both ingredients.”

My issue is I have been using [Natural BHA Skin Returning A-sol](https://www.cosrx.com/cosrx-natural-bha-skin-returning-a-sol-1.html) in the morning and using [CeraVe Skin Renewing Retinol Serum](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/serums/skin-renewing-retinol-serum) at night. But I want to fit a Vitamin C into my routine. When researching Vitamin C and BHA all feedback says to do them at different times because of acidic ingredients.",1570679295.0,1.0,3
[Personal] Starting a skincare journey to battle skin picking disorder,"I've had it since I was a toddler, was focused a lot on my limbs but when I grew older the focus went straight to my face. I have a lot of nervous habits like nail biting and hair pulling, but skin picking in particular I got diagnosed with as a disorder. Cue a lifelong refusal from my parents to take me to a dermatologist. They said that there was no point in me getting my skin clear with expensive products if I'm just going to pick at it anyways.

So here I am, 18, in college, and super self conscious about my skin. When you pick at your skin so much you tend to forget other people DONT do it as well, so seeing everyone with clear skin is really difficult. And I want to change this.

There's not really medicine to fight the impulses (I've tried many) so I have to work with what I have, which is my skincare routine. I've never really had a set skincare routine because standing in front of a mirror alone makes me pick at my skin obsessively (also what my parents kept repeating to me made me give up on my skin), but God do I want to change this.

I have dry skin that tends to flake a lot which contributes to me picking it off, really bad skin texture and a lot of scarring. Small breakouts are really common too, I do tend to have acne, and my nose looks like a strawberry

After watching a lot of videos I bought Cerave SA cleanser and lotion for bumpy skin. That's all I have for now, since it is an investment. I'm also scared of a lot of exfoliants since my skin has a lot of lesions. 

This journey will be difficult. But in my head it's like a cycle: the worse my skin looks, the more I want to pick at the imperfections. So (theoretically) I can maybe lessen the impulses if my skin is too nice for me to ruin it. I don't know, this barely makes sense in my head.

But I'm trying! And taking in any advice since I'm fairly new to all this. I really hope months from now I'm able to make an update here about how much better my skin looks.",1570678321.0,1.0,5
[Product Question] Do these two ingredients cause purging?,"I’ve been looking at the ingredients on some of my new products and the description for the products say that they “slough” away dead skin cells and what not. So I also did my own research on this but I keep finding conflicting reports. So:

Do ingredients such as willow bark extract and sugar cane extract cause slight purging? The reason I ask is because even though they’re simply extracts, a lot of people consider them to be just natural versions of salicylic acid/glycolic. 

ALSO, I wanted to know that if an product has salicylic acid in it, does it need to be listed as an active ingredient? Or can it just be listed as regular salicylic acid with the rest of the ingredients? And does this mean anything different like if it’s listed as an active vs. If it’s not?

I really hope this makes sense. Thank you guys!!!!",1570678126.0,0.5,2

Lactic acid without HA? [product question],"So I’m looking to introduce a chemical exfoliant into my routine because I have a lot of closed comedones.

I have dry sensitive skin so I’m hesitant to try something stronger. 

And do you think it’s okay that the lactic acid has Hyaluronic acid or should I avoid that if I know it gives me closed comedones?

If I should avoid it can you suggest a reputable brand of lactic acid that doesn’t contain HA?

I also just noticed my face moisturizer (simple hydrating gel cream) has lactic acid as the last ingredient. Does that mean it’s exfoliating at all? Or is it likely too low of lactic acid to do anything?

Can Clindamycin cause a purge? [acne],"Hi all! I have struggled with acne since I was a teenager, and over the summer decided to try differin.

[Sun Care] [Routine Help] CC cream - Peter Thomas Roth or Supergoop?,"Peter Thomas Roth Max Mineral Naked SPF 45 or Supergoop Smooth and Poreless Mineral Matte SPF 40? That is the question! 

Backstory: I've been working towards a more minimal skincare and makeup routine in preparation for a long term backpacking trip. I have been trying out CC creams in the hopes that they will provide sun protection but also provide some light coverage so I can ditch my pressed powder and makeup brush. The two listed above haven't broken me out and have provided the amount of coverage that I am looking for but I'm not sure if either one has benefits that would outweigh the other. Particularly concerned about moving from a typically dry climate with little sun exposure to a humid climate with a lot of sun exposure. 

Current Routine: I have switched over to Cerve (thank you SCA!) which has honestly saved my skin and allowed me to cut my skincare routine down from a drawer full of products to just their foaming cleanser followed by their moisturizing cream, morning and night. When I use the CC cream, I use that instead of the cream in the morning.

I’ve tried moisturisers meant to be non-greasy (Clinique Dramatically Different gel, which made things dramatically worse, Neutrogena Hydro Boost gel...). I even at one point tried applying anti-dandruff shampoo to the area, read that on the internet. Nothing bloody works, it’s so frustrating. I also get red pimples as the following image shows:

I’m having a pretty massive hormonal acne breakout around my jaw on both sides. Painful, red, just all around terrible. It’s been going on for a few months but worse the past few weeks. 

I started using BP on the worst areas and Cerave SA cream. Cerave moisturizer. I’ve been using microfiber pads to take off my makeup in hopes of using a few less products. I’ve also had some fungal acne spots that I’ve treated with Selsun Blue.

So, I don't remember exactly what the product is called, but I think it was something along the lines of an exfoliating peel gel. I remember that the tube was like a brown copper color. I want to say that the price range for the full size was somewhere in the ball park of $60-$100, but I could be wrong. The product itself was really cool: the instructions were to apply it to the face and rub it in, and slowly but surely, all this dead skin would come off in little balls. It was one of the best I've ever used, but at the time, I couldn't purchase it because it was out of my price range. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

[Routine Help]-Any suggestions on really good chapsticks/lip balms that actually work and moisturize lips?,"Please correct me if i'm wrong. I've heard that it is best to use chapstick during the day and lip balm over the night. Currently as a lip balm i'm using avene cold cream ( however i use it both day and night) but the problem with this is that it smears of after a couple minutes when i wear it during the day.

As a consequence, i wanted to try something new, preferably natural or with good ingredients that do not harm my lips, that doesn't go away immediately and that deeply nourished my lips making them look and be healthy .

I am also searching for something that excludes excessive fragrances, petrolatums or petrolatum jelly , or any harmful ingredients.

I've hear good things about aquaphor healing ointment/ repair but looking at the ingredient list i see there is petrolatum jelly , which might not be good in the long run. I've also heard about burt's bees wax but im not sure it could do any good.

Moreover, my lips are extremely sensitive , and the only lip balms that haven't irritated my lips are this avene cold cream i'm currently using and blistex lip balm.

As a conclusion , i'm looking for something that:

**-deeply nourishes/hydrates**

**-lasts long**

**-doesn't just sit on my lips without doing anything**

**-preferably with natural or unharmful ingredients**

**-doesn't irritate**

Now I use it 2x a day (morning, night) with a spot treatment around lunch and it stays just about stagnant. I wash my face with CeraVe facial cleanser every time and apply CeraVe moisturizer as well.

It was very rare for me to break out with cystic acne.

Evening:

[Personal] Changing antidepressants helped cure my skincare fixation.,"Hi, community.

I've been vocal here about how this subreddit fosters a culture of obsession, fixation, dysmorphia, and anxiety. Unfortunately, I've been letting myself get sucked into the very mindset that I've been criticizing. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for over a decade, and some time last year, I discovered the world of skincare. My money started disappearing, my bathroom storage started shrinking, and I started planning my social life around my skincare regimen--*no, I'm not going to that concert, because that's mask night and I won't do masks if I come home drunk.*

I didn't realize how much I loved the control of collecting and crafting a skincare routine until I got a rush after an unexpected breakout. I had a new project! I had a new problem to solve! I had something new to fixate on! My skincare fixation escalated to creating daily spreadsheets that covered everything from the weather to my caloric intake.

My skin was getting better, but the rest of my life was looking really shitty. I was letting my spreadsheets get in the way of my actual work spreadsheets, I was sacrificing time with my fiance to stay holed up in my bathroom, and I was recklessly spending money on new products. A depressive episode hit me like a sucker punch and I realized that I was sacrificing time dedicated to other forms of grooming (shaving, waxing, ironing my clothes, etc.) just to expand my AM and PM skincare routines.

In short, I was really letting myself go, while convincing myself that I was keeping it together because my skin looked great and I had shiny new toys to play with at my bathroom sink. I finally hit a really low low and went to a new psychiatrist. She told me that she thinks I have some OCD symptoms (intrusive thoughts, unhealthy fixations, panic over routines) and prescribed an SNRI that is used to treat depression, anxiety, and mild OCD.

I've been on this medication for a month now and I've cut my skincare routine down to a cleanser, toner, treatment, moisturizer, and sunscreen. I threw all of the products I don't use into a box and gave it to my neighbor to pick through. I told her to give away what she didn't want so I didn't have to see it again.

My skin is still clear, but I'm now devoting time and headspace to my job, my relationship, and my social life. My job performance has skyrocketed, I'm delighting in spending evenings with my fiance again, and I'm more social than I've been since college.

It's not okay to let this shit run your life. If you think you're channeling your mental illness into your skincare routine, think hard about why you do that and how you can make it better. It took a new medication to force me to have this realization, but I'm so happy that I did.

Editing to add: you might not strike luck on your first attempt at treating your mental illness. This certainly was not my first attempt. Please don't think that I took a magic pill! Xoxo",1570647531.0,0.95,19

"[Acne] My doctor refuses to believe my acne is fungal, or test it. And is absolutely against prescribing me anti-fungal treatment. Despite my acne only responding positively to anti-fungal treatment?!","So I had a real bad breakout a month ago.... it’s been horrible I’m used to acne but this was a new experience. It itches and it gets worse after wearing makeup or sweating and no amount of benzoyl Peroxide or salicylic acid or lactic acid reduces the size. In fact with each swipe of cream my spots became more aggressive.

Alas I googled “yeast acne” ( after popping a spot that had a smell that reminded me of yeast) TMI, I know but this brought up the term fungal acne and a whole new insight. I bought 1% clotrimazole cream and zinc pyrithione anti dandruff shampoo. This started a whole new routine and within a few days my face transformed. 

In a week my face was “normalish” a few spots here and there and I stopped my routine( maybe a bit too early) But it all came back albeit not as bad. 

Fast forward and I decided to get a doctors appointment hoping to be prescribed an oral antifungal or something stronger. To my surprise despite all that’s happened she said it doesn’t look like fungal acne and then refused to give me any medication other than typical acne treatments (which I already told her irritated the spots further). She also didn’t want to do any tests because she was so sure she was right. She prescribed me another cream containing benzoyl Peroxide!? Should I listen to her? Does this make sense? Could I really be wrong? Or has this happened to anyone else?

[PSA] Olay will be launching a refillable moisturizer (on a trial basis for now),"[Article here](https://www.allure.com/story/olay-whip-refillable-moisturizer-packaging-breast-cancer-awareness-month)

On the positive side, it's great to see more Western (and big name) companies looking into more sustainable options, but I was disappointed to see that it's on a trial basis and that it's being sold for an astronomical price ($59 for the moisturizer and refill; though at least for this particular product, it's helpful to note that the proceeds will go to a good cause!). 

I suppose the trial basis is logical since they have to make a profit, but I suspect it will be a profitable endeavor in the future, particularly for popular products. I think if a product came in pretty nice packaging and I could just buy a recyclable refill, I would have some decent incentive to rebuy. 

I'd also note that while I think the price is ridiculous, it matches the price they generally sell that moisturizer at. I'm hoping/looking forward to what other more affordable brands (e.g. CeraVe and Neutrogena) will do.

I'm also curious as to whether Olay will take back the pods or if you send them to your local recycling (which may or may not actually recycle them).

What are your thoughts? Does this kind of product interest you and do you like how they're doing it or would you change something?",1570644757.0,0.99,70

[DIY][Skin Concerns]Question: Microneedling pen technique for acne scars: drag or lift and stamp?,"Hello guys,

I started micro needling at home with Dr. Pen Ultima A6 for my bad acne scars on both of my cheeks. I have noticed that for length below maybe 1mm, the needles would retract under the cartridge, and poke out. So for these length, I think it would be okay to drag the pen across the whole area like the video we see everywhere online.

However, for length let's say 2mm or more, the needles are constantly extended above the cartridge shield even at retracted state (verified with iPhone slow-motion video). So I was wondering, for those of you who DIY at home and the professionals, would you drag with a long needle length, or lift and stamp across the face?

Thanks!

[Skin Concerns] Dark Marks after Facial (No Peel Involved),"I had a bad breakout two weeks ago so I got an acne facial with a new to me esthetician last night. Facial went well, did some masks, led light therapy, extractions, ultrasound(?) therapy. 

It was a very acid forward facial. As a last step before applying moisturizer she used this serum on me with 10% glycolic, 10% lactic, and 5% salicylic. My entire face had no reaction except for some slight tingling when the product was first placed but on my left check it immediately started frosting.  The esthetician quickly cleaned off that side of my face with water and applied a hydrating gel mask to sit there for a few minutes. 

She explained what happened and said it’ll peel and to wear sunscreen everyday. She also said not to exfoliate for at least 5 days. (I plan on waiting a week since multiple acids were involved in the facial). 

This morning though I woke up and the two pimples where the serum had a bad reaction turned a dark brown.  Below is a link with pics of that side of my face at 2 hrs after the facial, 4 hrs after, and 12 hrs after. The rest of my face actually looks so much better after the facial so I don’t understand why the reaction was so specific to that part of my face.

[Routine Help] Burned my face with benzoyl peroxide AGAIN," Hi! Desperate for some help here, my engagement photos are this Sunday and like a dumb idiot I once again burned the shit out of my face with benzoyl peroxide.

I always have closed comedones all on either side of my chin close to my jawline that just won't move. I use prescription tretinion (.025%) and Paula's choice BHA exfoliant a few times a week (not together) and they help with my other acne but these little bumps never seem to move. About 6 months ago I gave 10% bp a whirl and they cleared those comedones right up but I also ended up looking like shireen from game of thrones for about 10 days.

I decided to give it another try on Saturday (dumb, I know) and see if I used a much smaller amount and no other actives I wouldn't have the same reaction. To be fair, it is a lot better than what happened last time, I'm not flaking or oozing but it feels very dry and textured and stings when anything is applied to it.

Honestly i could live with this until it heals up BUT i have my engagement pictures on Sunday and I'll have to wear makeup which right now is not an option with all this texture.

Currently I am:

Hada Labo oil cleanser at night

Cerave hydrating cleanser

Hylamide hydrating mist

Corsx Snail mucin mixed with inkey HA on still damp skin

Skin owl geranium oil

pauala's choice defense nightly reconditioning moisturizer (at night only)

Vaseline at night only

I know typically it is due to hormones, sensitivities, etc., but I have just not been able to pinpoint it.

Or if that was the case, would it not make sense for it to ONLY be on my chin?** I definitely can tell when a product causes me to breakout, as it is usually some clogged pores, etc. on other areas of my face. I am just wondering if anyone has had an experience where they used a product on their entire face and ONLY experienced a reaction in a certain area, such as the chin (if that makes sense). **If it was a product I am using, wouldn't it cause breakouts in other areas as well? Or is it possible to only cause acne in SPECIFIC areas?**

For reference, the acne is inflammatory, different from the usual clogged pores, etc. I get when i wear too much makeup and what not. I get very oily on most parts of my face, so it's not like my chin happens to be the only oily area. Also, I have a strong suspicion that SUGAR is the cause for my chin acne, although I haven't been able to make the connection 100%.

[Misc] Overwhelmed by Skincare :(,"Hello, something that's really causing me to go into 'paralysis by analysis' mode is the fact that everything can 'clog' your pores. Honestly people say to patch test and all, and that's what causes me to obsess about these things. I can't say for sure if something really caused me pimple even if I patch test, because I also get pimples in places where I don't patch test. Even if pimple doesn't appear after X amount of time, somewhere down the line it will pop up in that place, forcing me to think it's the product that caused it. 

People also say that even Tretinoin cream can cause clogged pores because of the inactive ingredients, making your breakouts even worse. This to me seems paradoxical, because the whole point of it is to unclog pores. You also need cleanser, sunscreen and moisturizer along side your treatment, but how can I know if they clog me up before starting treatment if I don't have clear skin, it's impossible. Yes you can find a patch of skin that 'generally' doesn't break out, but even if you do breakout, it could just be a random break out, diet, hormonal changes, million different things. You'd have to recreate the same conditions every time you test a product, which seems impossible.

If you throw away a product whenever you get a pimple, you'd be broke.

[Product question] EltaMD UV Physical Broad-spectrum SPF41 tinted sunscreen,"Hey there!  


So, I live in Slovenia, and I have no way of buying EltaMD products from anywhere here. So, I turned to UK Amazon - being the only place I can order to my country. A while after the purchase, I wanted to send the listing to my friends asking where I found it, and that's when I noticed a whole bunch of comments saying the product is a fake, but also a bunch of saying its fine. The listing had more buying options, so I guess that's where the confusion comes from..  the bad reviews didn't specify what seller.  


First thing, I wrote an email to the seller, but of course, they assured me, that the product isn't a fake - but I mean, I didn't really expect them to admit to it, as that breaks Amazon policy. I'm only worried, because my order was fullfilled by the seller, and because the item was a bit cheaper - about 28$ with no postage. I was checking the box, it was sent from USA to Germany, from Germany to me. That can't be cheap, sure as hell isn't free, and I know how free postage works, it's usually embedded in the product price, not hurting the margin.   


Now, I've read every bad review. Mostly they said that the original is kinda buttery and sinks in lovely, while the fake one is super oily and weirdly colored. My sunscreen is buttery-siliconey, has a normal tint that doesn't really add anything to the face (kinda like the Coola mineral tinted). It sank in completely, leaving kind of a powdery finish. It's matt, but not drying like Korean physical sunscreens. 

I like the sunscreen. Scratch that, I really love it. But I'm hesitant to use it, as I am still a bit doubtfull about what I am putting on my face. I am acne prone and somewhat sensitive, so I fear doing serious damage..   


Anyone here bought a fake and can make a comparison? Anyone here that has the original, and can tell me if my review sounds right? Maybe send me some pictures? I checked the pictures on Dermstore, and the blob of sunscreen looks exactly like what I have - same consistency, same color.. so do the box and the tube.   


This is my first purchase of this sunscreen, so I have nothing to compare it to. Any advice on a website or Amazon/Ebay seller where I can be sure I am buying the original? It needs to send to EU (Slovenia).. Thanks for your help.",1570619396.0,1.0,1
[Routine Help] Confused about skin type and products to use.,"Hey guys, 

I'm pretty confused about where to start. I'm really a noob when it comes to skincare products. 

I'll just try to list out all the details which I can give you. Please feel free to ask me if you want any additional details. 

Sorry for the long post in advance. 

I hope this subreddit can help me. I've seen pretty promising posts in here. 

# All about my skin

* **Combination Skin**: I believe I have combination skin because my T-zone gets pretty oily within like 15 minutes of washing and the rest of the face just dries out (depending on weather). Also, it is important to mention that I sweat a lot. I have a lot of heat flashes because of PCOS. 
* **Concern - Acne/Blackheads/Whiteheads/Pores**: I have had pretty horrible acne as a teenager. Now, I don't break out as much but I have pretty large pores on my skin. I accumulate black and whiteheads pretty quickly. (Like, within a week of getting a professional clean-up, you could see a  significant number of white and blackheads.) IDK if this is relevant, but I have PCOS and a hormonal imbalance, therefore. Though I don't have any hormonal acne, I believe hormonal imbalances do otherwise affect the skin. You'll have to confirm though.
* **Concern - Sensitive Skin/ (Sunburn?)** \- I can't say I have overly sensitive skin as I don't react as much to most products. But, in a full-body scan which included a scan of my skin, my doctor showed me that the top 4 layers of my exposed skin (face) has a sun-tan (I'm guessing he means sunburn or sun damage). 
* **Back-ne**: As a teenager, I was host to a lot of dandruff. My dermatologist from then has mentioned that this dandruff had resulted in a lot of acne on my shoulders and back (face too). On this day, though I don't have dandruff (except sometimes in harsh winters), I still have some back-ne. 

# Products I use 

I don't really have a routine as such, but I'll just list here the products I currently use. 

* **Cleanser**: I use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser twice a day, once in the morning, one at night before sleeping. (Sometimes thrice depending on activity) 
* **Toner**: I use [this](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01LWPEJEP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) toner right after cleansing my skin with Cetaphil at night. I do live in one of the most polluted cities in the WORLD. 
* **Moisturizing Cream**: (I know I'll face a significant amount of criticism for this) I do not moisturize my face in the morning. I feel like my natural skin oils do the job just fine. At night, after using the toner I use this [Calamine lotion](https://www.amazon.in/Lacto-Calamine-Lotion-Balance-Combination/dp/B071SDS4ZM/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=lacto+calamine&qid=1570621502&sr=8-5). I feel like this doesn't make my skin oily, but with enough movement and sweat, even this makes my face feel heavy.  
* **Sunscreen**: Due to popular recommendations, I purchased the [Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF](https://www.amazon.in/Neutrogena-Ultra-Sheer-Dry-Touch-Sunblock/dp/B000EPA4GQ/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=neutrogena+spf&qid=1570621619&sr=8-3). I was very disappointed. This did end up leaving a shiny layer on my face, and the more I sweat, the shinier it got. I also felt like I sweat more because of it. So, at the moment I just use a [Lakme sunscreen](https://www.amazon.in/Lakme-Sun-Expert-Lotion-120ml/dp/B008KH4YKC/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=lakme+spf&qid=1570621718&sr=8-3) for the other parts of my body, but yes, my face does not have any moisturizer or sunscreen when I leave home.
* **Exfoliation**: I use [Clean and Clear's daily scrub](https://www.amazon.in/Clean-Clear-Black-Head-Scrub/dp/B01CGEV5H4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=clean+and+clear+scrub+daily&qid=1570622030&s=pantry&sr=8-1) maybe once a week, depending on how much my skin is exposed to pollution. Every Sunday I use a herbal apricot scrub. Mid-week I use my ultrasonic skin scrubber with Cetaphil on the peeling mode. Once a month I do a routine with steam, scrub, extractions (using ultrasonic skin scrubber) ending with a face mask (by Face Shop usually). 

I also work on a budget, as you can tell from my usage of drugstore products. I'd appreciate it if you could give me advice about cheaper alternatives.

My acne is quite bad at the moment(for me) and the breakouts around my mouth and on my lower cheeks are refusing to subside. I have only been on Differin for about 4-5 weeks now, so I know it's probably purging, but it still sucks. So far I haven't had any dryness, just a little more red than normal and occasionally mildly itchy. 


I'm going on holiday in just under a month, and am praying to the gods my skin clears just a little xD


I want to add 2.5% Benzac(benzoyl peroxide) on the nights where I'm not using Differin to try and quell the breakouts. I've heard that a lower percentage and short contact therapy works just as well as leaving it on overnight, so that is my plan for the moment. I'm just a bit nervous - I saw some comments saying BP and Differin at the same time can ruin your moisture barrier, and you only realise that's happened once it's too late.

"[Skin Concerns] I'm being presented with an award tonight & have had a negative reaction to my AHA BHA peel, need some advice.","Hey everyone,

The past few days I've had a very basic routine:
Morning & Evening: CeraVe hydrating cleanser followed by Nuetrogena water gel moisturiser.
A couple of those morning also included 5% glycolic acid 'glow' toner. I last used the glycolic acid 2 days ago. 

Last night I used my TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution, and it felt totally normal. I thoroughly rinsed it off with a cloth and noticed it was definitely stinging more than normal (it usually just tingles a bit). As time went by, it started stinging more and more and I gave my skin another rinse with water and a cloth. I tried putting on moisturiser but it stung too much but I was able to put a layer of Vaseline on it for the night.

This morning, my face felt fine and I used my CeraVe cleanser to take off the Vaseline and it began to sting again. I managed to get on my moisturiser with the stinging but now it's constantly (mildly) stinging.

This after, I need to be able to put on makeup for the award ceramony later (there'll be photos taken of me).

I'm asking you all if you've any advice/recommendations on what I can do to try and help my skin as much as I can before I kill it with makeup later.

Thanks in advance, and sorry this is so long.",1570611247.0,0.67,7

[Sun Care] Does retinol make skin susceptible to UV even after being washed off?," I apply a hint of retinol under my eyes every night and wash them off every morning.

[Routine Help] Did/do you manually exfoliate while using DIFFERIN (.1% OTC) and how?,"Hello all. First time posting.

So I've finally worked up to using Differin .1% on a daily basis to address my (lifelong) closed comedones (and yay...it's working). I used it every 3 days for a couple of weeks, then every 2 days for a week, and now I'm on Day 9 of Daily use. Up until this point I only got these fine gritty particles on my face, until today. My skin has started scaling. It's not too bad yet, yet I know this will continue.

BUT... the manufacturer's website recommends to avoid all manual exfoliation. Well, up to this point I was using a gentle (manual, not chemical leave-on) Korean peeling gel (gommage) 1-2x week to get rid of the fine grits, so I already broke that rule. Problem is, I know I'm going to need more exfoliation than this but manufacturers warning makes me think something bad will happen to my skin, and  I am afraid of thinning out my skin too much (I'm in my 40s).

So, for those of you that experienc(ed) scaling/flaking with Differin, did you put up with months of stiff scaly skin, or did you buck the recommendation and manually exfoliate anyway? If you did, what did you use and how often?

Appreciate any advice :). It's my first time using a retinoid. 

[My routine, if it matters: Since using this daily, I have cut actives (AHA/BHA etc) from my skin routine. It's pretty much just my mild cleanser, then Rosehip Oil during the day (most moisturizers will break me out in zits). If I go outside I forgo the RH oil and use a mineral sunscreen w/ powder on top or if in a hurry, the line's SPF 30. Differin at night, post cleansing. Plus: 1-2x a week, the aforementioned gommage peeling gel (Face Shop White Jewel Formula) before cleansing.]",1570608429.0,1.0,13

Hi guys! I am a 27 year old female that, until about a year ago, had fairly clear skin my entire life. I moved back to a very dry climate about a year and a half ago, and six months in, my skin started to break out badly. 

I grew up in this climate so I don’t think it’s the cause of the problem, just the one big change in my lifestyle that I can think of. I have gone to the doctor and gotten a birth control pill that is supposed to be good for acne, I believe it’s called Milli. It hasn’t been much help. I have done research on this sub and changed my skin routine accordingly. I believe this helped for a little while, but I am back to severe break outs. 

Before anyone asks, I wash my blankets, towels and pillowcases weekly at least. I also try my hardest not to pick or pop any blemishes because my pale skin scars easily. 

Without further ado, my routine is as follows:

Morning-
  Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser

  Witch Hazel or Sea Breeze astringent
 
  L’Oréal Revitalift for a moisturizing sunscreen

Night-
  Either Drunk Elephant Beste No. 9 Jelly Cleanser and/or Oxy brand face wash with Benzoyl Peroxide 

  Witch Hazel or Sea Breeze astringent 

  Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide moisturizer (applied pretty thick)

I will occasionally do a face mask like the Peter Thomas Roth Therapeutic Sulfur mask or the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay  

You guys, I am trying SO HARD, but to no avail and it has been bringing me to tears lately. I am a bartender so I have to be in front of tons of people all day and I am starting to sense my skin introducing itself before I can, and it kills me inside a little every time. 

I will be making a post periodically until someone, anyone, can help me. I AM SO DESPERATE YOU GUYS. I LITERALLY DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO TURN. HELP.",1570605210.0,0.82,27

[Skin Concerns] Will skincare products with alcohol negatively affect already healed tattoos?,"I have a tattoo that's already healed a long time ago. I regularly moisturize it (with [CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Moisturizing-Lotion-Hyaluronic-Fragrance/dp/B000YJ2SLG/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=cerave&qid=1570574473&sr=8-4)) and wear sunscreen to protect it whenever it's exposed, like how I regularly make sure to do with my face.

I've been unsatisfied, however, with most of the sunscreens that I've tried using, since they tend to be greasy, flaky, leave a white cast, etc. After reading the sunscreen recommendations on this subreddit's wiki, I decided to try out [Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ / PA++++](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Biore+UV+Aqua+Rich+Watery+Essence) (2018 version).

I noticed that it has a seemingly high alcohol content, which shouldn't be a problem for my face since I already moisturize my skin before wearing sunscreen, although I'm not as certain about my tattoo. I know that with tattoo aftercare that it's recommended to avoid using anything that contains drying alcohols when it's healing, but I couldn't find much clear information about taking that precaution after it's healed. Is it likely that use of products with alcohol, such as this, will negatively affect my tattoo?",1570576657.0,1.0,1

DESPERATLY trying to find a cleanser free of coconut derivatives [routine help],"Hi all. I’m stressed. 

Any face wash with coconut derivatives (including the alcohols found in coconut) gives me an allergic reaction. 

Usually a coconut derivative is an ingredient with the letters “coc” before the rest of the word. 

The ingredients I am sensitive to and cause breakouts or an allergic reaction are: alcohols (especially cetyl, cetearyl, and stearyl alcohol), petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, hyaluronic acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, any coconut derivatives, argan oil, and jojoba oil.

I’ve been using the Clinique face soap extra mild BUT it’s not cleansing enough. I’m covered in closed comedones now from just two weeks of using this. 

I’m super bummed because it was the only one I’ve found that doesn’t give me an allergic reaction.

[Review] Barisun 50+ UVA/UVB and Anessa 50+ PA++++ Sunscreen,"**Skin type**:  Dry/Sensitive/Acne-prone

Hi all! Here’s a review for 2 sunscreens I've tried recently and haven't seen a bunch of on here, let me know if you have any questions!

Sunscreens:

**[BARIÉSUN Fragrance-Free Cream SPF50+](https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/bariesun-creme-sans-parfum-spf50-1)**

**Cost**: $24 for 50ml, looks like it’s on Amazon for $19 currently!

**Rating**: 2/5

I really wanted to like this sunscreen, back when I discovered it, the protection rating was one of the best but it didn’t have a lot of reviews or recommendations. It’s got a slight ivory tint to it, maybe a bit darker, but not quite a tinted sunscreen. Its thicker than a lot of Asian sunscreens as it’s less milk-like and more of a thin to midrange lotion consistency.  It applies easily. However, it feels like it just sits on your skin and stays tacky with a sheen, so it’s definitely not for the matte lovers out there. I can usually deal with tackiness, but it felt like my skin was oily all day. It made me break out along my cheeks and jawline more than I usually do, as my jawline is my problem area. Despite its downsides, I didn’t burn/darken at all, even after only applying it once without reapplication a few days. I am very fair and burn like a lobster without sun protection! I didn’t have any issues with a white cast, although I’m not the best person to test that on since I look like a ghost naturally. I also tested it under makeup for you makeup lovers out there. It does fine under my light cream foundation and under concealer, but when I wore both it felt like I was wearing a heavy foundation and my skin felt cakey, but there were no visual problems. 


**[Anessa Mild Milk <for sensitive skin> 50+ PA++++](http://anessa.shiseido.co.jp/en/products/suncare/perfect_uv_mild/)**

**Cost**: $33 for 60mL

**Rating**: 4.5/5

I love this sunscreen, its exactly like you would imagine an Asian sunscreen, very milky and goes on easily. It is water-resistant and dries down after roughly 15-30 minutes, depending on how heavy you go! It mixes well with my cream makeup and it dries down smooth with a matte appearance. I can usually go all day with only one reapplication for this sunscreen. I’ve worn it to a waterpark and wore it in a combo indoor/outdoor hot tub and it stayed on like a champ. It washes off pretty easily with every cleanser I’ve tried. The color is white and no white cast that I can tell, though YMMV. It’s my goto sunscreen and no issues with breakouts on my end. My only gripe is the cost for how much you get.",1570574096.0,0.86,8

[Sun Care] Help me with all this information about sunscreens," 

Hello  and I'm glad u're reading this. I've been searching about sunscreen and  oh my god, its so much information. I'm kind of confused.

\-So,  I'm a guy, I dont use make up. -I want the best sunscreen to protect  against aging effects of sunscreen. So Think I need a high PPD. -So I  found this sunscreen: Bioderma Photoderm Max Spray SPF50+ 400ml [https://www.ebay.com/itm/Bioderma-Photoderm-MAX-Spray-SPF50-400ml/252881871058?hash=item3ae0ef20d2:g:nFUAAOSw42dZGeML](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Bioderma-Photoderm-MAX-Spray-SPF50-400ml/252881871058?hash=item3ae0ef20d2:g:nFUAAOSw42dZGeML)

It's  amazing, cause its PPD is 33 and its kind of cheap for a 400ml Bottle. I  thought I was done, till I read the ingredients and there it says BUTYL  METHOXYDIBENZOYLMETHANE = AVOBENZONE. And I read Avobenzone is  photoinstable so it sucks. Is it right ? I dont know.

I read this interesting comment too:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/b14zfs/sun\_care\_best\_budget\_high\_uva\_protection/ekjxgdp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/b14zfs/sun_care_best_budget_high_uva_protection/ekjxgdp/)

I  didn't really understood what this user meant to say. He says that  Univul A plus cover all the UVA spectrum, and then says only sunscreens  from that list is really safe to know that covers it all. But Why ???  And more, the Rohto Sunscreen that he talks about that is ""fine"" also  has Univul A Plus in its components([http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic\_6b5f239352.html](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_6b5f239352.html)),  so doesn't it cover all the spectrum ?? Didn't understand what was this  user base to pick that list. I mean, how does he know that only that  ones are protective in this spectrum, does he know of any tests they  have passed?

Like, this first  spray I picked, its ppd is 33, but if this avobenzone thing is  photoinstable, does it means it will not last the effect ?? Anyway, this  thing is confusing.

If this Avobenzone really sucks, it seems that my best option is this Rohto sunscreen. Cause I can afford the price.

Can someone clarify things to me, please ???",1570571409.0,0.72,7

"[Product Question] I bought cheap stuff from miniso, does anyone has any experience with it?","Hi, i just bought a really cheap sleeping mask, and a tea tree essence, to be honest, the low prices and the heat of the moment got the best of me, and i bought it without considering if it would be safe, anyways, i thought about asking here since you're all experts when it comes to ingredients,  i'm not expecting them to work wonders since they were super cheap, as long as they don't melt my fine i'm ok with them.  


[Here](https://imgur.com/a/l6QTWnL) is the list of ingredients for the tea tree essence, this one makes my skin feel good actually, refreshing, but when i put the tretinoin on top, it starts to sting a bit.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/cn0dbsw)is the list of ingredients for the sleeping mask, this one feels good overall, i think it's the least abrasive of the two, i don't know if i should use it daily because i've never used one before.

&#x200B;

My current routine is this:

AM:

\-Cerave Foaming Cleanser

\-Cerave Moisturizing Lotion

\-Local brand Sunscreen, UVA, UVB, 50+ fps

PM:

\-Cerave Foaming Cleanser

\-Tea Tree Essence over random pimples or acne (I've been doing this for only 2 days)

\-Cerave Moisturizing Lotion + a small amount of Tretinoin 0.5%

\-Miniso Sleeping Mask (I've been doing this for only 2 days)

&#x200B;

I did patch test it one day and it didn't kill my face, so i went ahead with it, but the stinging sensation i get from the tretinoin and the tea tree essence worries me a little.

Also a little bit unrelated: I'm getting a lot of red bumps after shaving :(, they last for 2-3 days, i use Gillete Mach 3 sensitive razors, and Gillete sensitive foam, any advice on this? it's just minor discomfort since they go away, but sometimes they evolve into pimples and might leave scars for longer :(.

Unrelated 2: Is it spelled Moisturizing or Moisturising? the Cerave bottle says Moisturising but google says Moisturizing, i'm consufed haha.

[Routine Help] [Hair Removal] Question regarding how to fit in facial bleaching and home IPL in my current skincare routine,"Question regarding Home IPL and Facial Bleaching while following a skincare routine

Hi I was wondering where in my current skincare routine can I fit in home ipl and facial bleaching. 

For the last couple of years I have been using the lumea precision plus on my legs, underarms and bikini line with great success. I am Indian with dark hair, oily skin which is dry when I wash it but gets oily after an hour or so and  I have acne and acne scars. The acne has reduced greatly but I still have scars. I also have a decent amount of dark facial hair which in the past I have used facial bleach FEM to lighten. To help the issue my current routine is 

AM
1. Wash face with cerave foaming facial cleanser

2. Cerave AM moisturizer

PM
1. Remove makeup with whatever I have on hand which has ranged from Nivea double effect to micelles cleaning gel wash to Banila Co Clean it zero, basically anything to take the makeup off

2. Cerave foaming facial cleanser

3. Sometimes I’ll use a toner as step three but not always

4. Few months ago I started using TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% every single evening and it’s helped heaps! Two weeks ago I bought TO Ascorbic Acid 8% + Alpha Arbutin 2% and I alternate the two as my last step. 

I don’t moisturize after as I’ve noticed my skin doesn’t feel tight after using either one of the TO products and after a couple of hours it gets oily. 

Seeing how I’m using acids where in my routine can I fit in facial bleaching and IPL? Would not using the TO products for two days on either side of facial bleaching be ok? Also how long a gap if I were to not use facial bleach and only use IPL?

Any help/advice would be appreciated! (Reposting as my previous post was taken off due to missing tags)",1570550561.0,0.67,1
"[Routine Help] Help! I think retinol is causing hair loss, what can I use instead?","Got into skincare about seven months ago and it’s been great! I’ve been using The Ordinary’s Retinol in Squalane .25%, went up to .5% about a couple months ago when I finished my first bottle. I also have noticed that I’ve had a ton of hair thinning/hair loss (I’m 28; have always had hair on the fine side but suddenly now I have big male pattern baldness style patches at my temples) and even a hairdresser commented on it. I’ve had a stressful summer with work but this seems extreme. Did some googling and found out retinol can cause hair loss - I know I’m using a low dose, so it seems extreme, but that’s the only real lifestyle change I think I’ve done in the past year. Did this happen to anyone else? Also, is there anything else preventative / anti aging I can use that doesn’t have an effect on hair growth? I loved the results, so I’m really sad.

My routine below -
AM 
Mainly just AB sunscreen, I alternate between Sunprise mild airy spf 50, missha all around safe block sunscreen, klairs uv essence, Andalou Naturals CC cream spf 50. Try to mostly use the mineral sunscreens on the daily.
Sometimes if I’m feeling fancy I’ll use TO Vitamin C Suspension in Silicone or TO azelaic acid, but not everyday.

[Skin Concerns] Help with scarring and collagen questions please!,"Hi, so I'm reading everything I can think of and I'm seeing that scars are composed of collagen. Yet, I keep reading that topically applying substances like vitamin e, coconut oil, aloe vera, honey, lemon, ACV, potato, baking soda etc. help scars to heal and may even reduce scar tissue formation or possibly even break it down after it's already formed.

Most of these substances make no sense to me because upon further reading, I see that a lot of them assist in collagen production.

Am I missing something here? If scars are just collagen fibers, and you apply something to stimulate collagen production, is that not just going to make it worse? Wouldn't that cause excess scar tissue to form? Like sure a wound may heal faster but is that at the cost of a worse scar than you would've had letting in heal on it's own?

I'm reading that taking a collagen supplement could do just that, make scarring worse.

"[Routine Help] Severely Damaged Skin Barrier - Need Advice, Encouragement, A Miracle","31 M here. For years my routine consisted of Aveeno's Gentle Foaming Cleanser + clarisonic and moisturizing with jojoba oil which despite my history with dry skin/eczema, gave me plump, glowy, even toned skin. This year I started getting acne from a pretty stressful life situation which I stupidly turned to harsh salicyclic acid washes and creams to fight. I believe the combination of stress and BHA products has completely ruined my skin barrier and I now have all of the following issues on my entire face  


* **extreme** oil production throughout the day. seriously it's like I threw a bucket of grease      on my face
* unhealthy looking orange-peel texture, large pores with sebum plugs poking out
* acne
* constant burning/tightness feeling
* sensitivity - if I laugh or yawn my skin gets red and flushed
* dull, rough looking skin with dehydration lines everywhere

It's been 6 months of this nightmare and despite the hours I spent reading on how to repair a damaged moisture barrier nothing I do seems to be working. I've practiced patch testing, stuck with products for a month for results, and even used my biology background to read clinical literature about the skin barrier. I've also re-read all the posts on here multiple times in hopes I missed some secret product/advice but I just end up hopeless. While there are lots of posts about people dealing with compromised skin barriers I'm willing to bet none are as damaged as mine. Here are things I've tried in these past months  


* Hada Labo Moist - didn't seem to do much plus I'm trying to avoid butylene glycol high on the ingredients list
* Matsuyama Balancing Toner - didn't seem to do much
* Krave Great Barrier Relief - used for a month with no results, plus it makes my face sting even more upon application
* Cosrx 96 Snail Mucin - caused me to break out in cystic acne
* Klairs Supple Prep Unscented - broke me out
* OCM with jojoba oil - broke me out
* Washing only with water - broke me out (not really surprised since I gym a lot)
* Slug life with Aquaphor

\*\*\* The following products below have the golden ratio of lipids but still didn't help \*\*\*

* Ceramol 311 face cream - used for a month with no results
* Stratia Liquid Gold - broke me out all 3 times I tried it
* Epiceram - stopped after a few uses because I'm pretty sure my face hates silicones  


For the past month I've been using Krave’s Matcha Hemp Cleanser (only water in the AM) and the Soon Jung line's toner, barrier cream, and sleeping pack but I still see no results. Nothing I apply seems to absorb or stop the burning feeling. To add insult to injury my brother is a dermatologist and suggests antibiotics, retinoids, steroid creams - all things this sub has cautioned against until your skin barrier is healthy again. I saw another derm for a second opinion and he sounded like the same broken record. I'm hoping you guys can give me some advice, words of encouragement, anything. I'm not just asking for skincare - I'm asking for my life back. I've been so depressed about my skin these past months I've avoided my friends, missed out on life, and am almost to the point of losing my job.

[Review] OGX Extra Strength Refreshing Scalp + Teatree Mint Shampoo. Would recommed for people with scalp conditions.,"Let me begin by saying, I have not been paid by the company, and I went out and purchased the products on my own.
 
Backstory: I have been a longtime sufferer of dandruff, 20 plus years. During that time, I had tried tons of things, very few things ever gave me any results. 

I'll give a few shoutouts to prescription Nizoral, and I actually kept a spray bottle of Apple Cider Vinegar in the shower with me at one point.

My most recent routine was slapping on some nonprescription Nizoral shampoo on my scalp and letting it sit, and then hopping in the shower to rinse it out. It didn't help at all.

I remember someone recommend I try tea tea oil, as it was supposed to help with dandruff, and kept that  thought stuck in my head.  I had tried Dr. Bronner's version, and it had no effect.

Anyways, I searched for Tea Tree oil shampoos recently, and I happened upon OGX's, and was surprised how highly reviewed it was on Amazon.  I'll share a few of the reviews that stood out to me:

I noticed I had flakes on my scalp when I was a teenager, and the first shampoo I ever tried for it was Selsun Blue. I remember applying it, and it smelled like medicine. It actually caused my entire scalp to flake over. I was mortified.

I suffered from oily patches, and dandruff that never would seem to go away. I remember getting out of the shower and it just being such a hit to my self-esteem to see flakes. My hair also seemed to have like a sticky consistency. 

Onto the review: I went out to Walmart to pick up the shampoo, since they kept it in stock. I think I paid $6.97 for it. It comes in a 385 ml bottle.

I would describe the consistency of the shampoo almost like a styling gel. It's kind of thick, which I like, and I have no problem getting it all over my scalp. 

The smell, it smells like mint chocolate ice cream. Some people will love it, some people will hate it. I personally love it.

Some people describe a tingling feel on the scalp when applying it, but I haven't noticed any. I will say it leaves your scalp with a cool refreshed feeling, almost like when you brush your teeth with a minty toothpaste, but on your scalp. 

After the very time I used it, I was disheartened to see I still had flakes. But I noticed it had seemingly loosened most of the flakes and pulled them off of my scalp. The next evening before I took my next shower, I brushed my hair out and  I had a hard time finding flakes.

For whatever reason this product just worked for me. It's been 99.5% effective at getting rid of my flakes. I just can't believe one product had such a dramatic effect after trying so many things and always being left disappointed. 

The only reason I took the time to write this review was in hopes it helps someone else. I also haven't seen much mention of OGX products on Reddit.

Because it worked so well, I went out several days after buying the shampoo and picked up OGX Tea Tree Mint Conditioner. I actually bought the wrong one. I guess they make an Extra Strength, but I bought Hydrating. The first time I used it, I didn't notice much difference. You're supposed to apply it, and let it sit 3 to 5 minutes and rinse. 

The second time using it my hair felt silky and light, and all the stickiness was gone. I just want to do Fabio shake-my-hair-outs and say, ""I can't believe there are no flakes."" 

It's quite an amazing difference. My scalp feels healthy. I just wish I had discovered it sooner. 

I used to have oily patches almost immediately after my hair would dry, mostly in the temples. Now, they're all gone. There were spots of my hair that would even take a long time to dry. I just can't believe the difference it's made.

Anyways, I can't believe it worked so fast and had such a dramatic effect. I hope the best results for you if you give it a go. Thanks for reading.",1570518320.0,1.0,1

"[Acne] Oily skin type, 15M teen, not very knowledgeable about skincare and need some help please! Also sum questions","Hello all, this is my first post on this subreddit and I’m 15M. I’m not very knowledgeable about skincare and need some guidance from skincare pros! I haven’t seen a dermatologist yet but I’ve scheduled one for next week.

I have problems trying to clear up my cheek acne.

My acne is only mild on my cheek but looks deceiving when my skin is inflamed. I have been using a ‘proper’ skincare routine for about 4 weeks (for my skin type) and am not too sure if I’m seeing results or not. Although, when my acne was not so severe I made the huge mistake of not identifying my skin type before buying over the counter products for my routine. I have an oily skin type and I purchased products for a normal skin type which I think caused my acne to become more severe. 

My current routine consists of a foam cleanser, an exfoliator and moisturiser. I use the cleanser daily and exfoliate 2-3 times a week in which I finish off with moisturising every time. I have been doing this routine for about 4 weeks and my cheek acne has not cleared up, am I doing something wrong??? 

Also a question, every time I get a pimple with pus in it (idk what its called sorry, but I think you get the idea), it seems to pop/break whenever I use my cleanser. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to do that or if I’m being too rough on my skin. Is my skin sensitive? Is the cleanser supposed to do that?

Another question, with acne, do you HAVE to use some sort of prescription medication or acne treatment to get rid of acne? I thought that just a normal skincare routine would clear up my cheek acne but I’m now thinking otherwise.

I try to wash / change my pillow 1-2 times a week and bedsheets every 2-3 weeks. I’m based in Sydney, Australia and I got my skincare products from chemist warehouse. Help skincare pros!",1570511701.0,0.67,2

[SKIN CONCERNS] HOW DO YOU PATCH TEST EYE MAKEUP?,"I tend to have issues with eczema around my eyes and I've had to toss out old eye shadow palettes that would trigger it. I haven't had issues with Colourpop or ABH palettes (fingers crossed) but just recently I picked up the WnW eyeshadow stick to use for a recent trip. I didn't really have issues with it during my trip (I was wearing it maybe 6 hours a day at most) but I noticed that when I'd wear it to work (which is 13 hours including commute) I would have redness and some swelling around the crease, which is how my eczema tends to flare up. I gave the eyeshadow stick a break and it went away, but today I tried to use it again to run errands for about 8 hours and after taking a shower I noticed some redness and puffiness again at the crease of one eye (the rest of the eyelid as fine). 

For those of you with similar issues, how can you safely test the product for a reaction without using it on your lids? I do get eczema on my face sometimes but it so far (fingers crossed) has never been triggered by makeup, so I don't think that swatching it at the side of my face on my day off would cause a reaction.",1570509735.0,1.0,4

[Skin Concerns] need help with closed comedones with sensitive skin and eczema,"I’m a 30 year old female, never really had trouble with my skin until about 5 years ago. I started getting deep pimples that never come to a head every now and then. Not a huge deal for me.

Two years ago I got eczema all over my face for the first time and it’s been a struggle ever since.  I think I ruined my skin with steroids and Vaseline or baby oil.

I use Desonide about three or four days a week and after the eczema patches have calmed down I’ll use either Vaseline or baby oil on the spots at night to prevent it from flaring back up. 

My eczema is usually around my nose, mouth and chin now. I noticed some time last year tiny skin colored bumps around my chin and mouth. Just a few here and there so I just left it alone.  Now it looks like I have at least 100 of them.  I think they are closed comedones because I can easily squeeze them and usually tiny white strings come out. I don’t squeeze them anymore because they come right back the next day anyway. They never come to a head or become inflamed.  

The only things I’ve tried is cutting out the Vaseline and the baby oil. That didn’t change anything so I cut out the steroid to see if that helped but it didn’t. I’ve also tried  salicylic acid and it looks like there’s more of them now. I’m too afraid to try anything else because of my eczema.  

The only products I’ve found that I can use on my face daily is neutrogena hydro boost hydrating gel cleanser,  and hydro boost water gel. I use the neutrogena exfoliating cleanser about once a week. 

Any ideas about what I can do for the comedones without flaring up eczema ?  I can comment with pictures of the bumps if need be.",1570507477.0,1.0,3

How my acne is /was - I usually get these light red  bumps which get pus filled white head in about 3days then once I squeeze out they start driving up.

My acne has never been better though. My question is, if I use the retinol and glycolic acid each once a week and then throw in a clay mask once a week as well, is that enough to be making any difference? Is it worth doing at all at that point? Is there any research to show how often you should apply these types of actives for results?

[Routine Help] Struggling with dehydrated skin and fungal acne,"So as the title says, I've been struggling with dehydrated skin and fungal acne..for a long time.   
It's on my face, chest, and back.  


My skin is dehydrated, oily, and flakey.  


I did start to see improvement with Nizoral, and with Head & Shoulders, but all of a sudden it seems like the Head & Shoulders has stopped working after about a week & a half. I don't think anything I'm using should have caused a flare and I changed nothing.  


My skin is also very dehydrated, and I now have lines on my forehead when I never have before. I'm 23, and worry that these lines will only get worse & become permanent if I can't get them under control quickly; I am also scared of the acne causing scarring if I can't get that under control quickly enough either.  


Additionally, I form several little -whiteheads- a day. I wake up with a fresh ""batch"" every day, and poke them with a steralized needle (steralizing in between each one I poke as well.) It's really, really exhausting to have to do this every time I wash my face.  


Any advice?  


I've had skin trouble since I was 13..and I'm very tired of getting my hopes up & seeing improvement that doesn't last.  


It started with routine acne (at 13), which doctors gave me antibiotics for, instructing me to take twice daily..which I did. For FIVE years (with small breaks). It wasn't until I was 18 that I realized how bad that is, and that no doctors looked out for me and let me know that. I have taken multiple round of potent probiotics (everything from 1 billion to over 100 billion) for about a year, and stopped doing that months ago. I couldn't really tell if they were making a difference, but even if they were, I didn't feel like it was sustainable to take them indefinitely & figured they had either already worked or wouldn't.   


I've also struggled with cystic acne for years, but that has seemed better for about 6 months now..fingers crossed though!  


I am also not one who can spend tons on skincare and I really prefer a routine that is as simple & affordable as possible.  


Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this/respond! Sorry my writing is sorta all over the place..I tried lol!

[ROUTINE HELP] Nervous Retin-A Newbie,"Hi guys! First post here (also first Reddit post ever I think...)

I want to start introducing Retin-A into the routine since I know a lot of people swear by it for wrinkle prevention, and sometimes to help with Acne. My dermatologist prescribed me .025%

For background, I used to have pretty bad cystic acne which has thankfully now cleared up entirely due to a vigorous regimen (happy to walk anyone through that journey if they’re interested). My holy grail topical products are Farmacy’s Green Clean cleanser and Farmacy’s Honeymoon Glow, which I use twice a week and is an AHA resurfacing serum.

I also use Herbivore’s Prism serum almost every morning, which is a 5% fruit acid exfoliant (will usually skip if I’ve done Honeymoon the night before). Happy to say that my routine is almost entirely all-natural at this point and it has made a huge difference.

I’ve heard a lot of conflicting things, so my questions about introducing retin-a are;

1. how many times a week should I start using the product (to my understanding you have to build up a tolerance)
2. is there supposed to be a “growing pains” period where your skin is getting used to it? I hear some people say that you have to push through flakiness until your skin gets used to it, and others say that you should stop if/when it is irritated
3. when I start using retin-a, do you think I have to lay off any of the other exfoliants I’m using? If so which ones? The last thing I want to do is to stress my skin out and have to manage breakouts/irritation again.

[Misc] I think I finally cured my eye eczema after years,"Okay so I have struggled with very painful eye eczema around my eyes for the past 5 years. Every year (around the time seasons start to change) my eyelids and under-eye area would be red, itchy, and so swollen I could barely open my eyes. It was incredibly painful, I would cry from how painful it was and then cry more because the tears would make it burn more. 

Up until now, I have tried sooo many treatments/products for it. 
Ive tried:
• FAB ultra repair cream
• Aloe
• Aquaphor
• Vaseline
• Rosehips oil
• Hyluaronic acid
• Snail serum
• Cerave cream
• Kiehls eye cream
• RoC eye cream
• Egyptian magic cream
• coconut oil
• shea butter
•Cortisone
And probably more that I can't remember right now.

Finally I was fed up, I had tried everything, I was taking Claritan everyday, and nothing was improving. So I schedule an appointment with my doctor in hopes that I could get referred to a derm. 

At my appointment, my doctor tells me to try using baby shampoo to clean the area and then use my Cerave and then Vaseline on top. I was really put off by the idea, it struck me as kind of Pinteresty but I gave it a shot anyway and it's been almost a week that I've been flake free and pain free! I can finally wear makeup again, use my usual skincare products, and I'm not waking up in unbearable pain every morning.

It sounds really strange, but if you have tried everything like me and haven't gotten any relief I highly recommend trying the baby shampoo. 

I used a generic brand of baby shampoo from the dollar store.

These were the instructions given to me by my doctor:
1.) Put a pea-size amount of baby shampoo on a cotton pad or cotton ball
2.) Dampen the cotton pad
3.) **Gently** rub the cotton pad on affected area(s)
4.) Rinse area
5.) Apply cream (using a qtip) that is suitable for the eye area (I used Cerave cream) and put a thin layer of vaseline over the cream

I also would like to note that I supplement this with Claritin most days but even on the days I have forgotten I haven't had any itchiness or flaking :)

I did this once and I haven't had issues since then! I hope this helps someone out there

TLDR; using baby shampoo on a damp cotton pad to cleanse my eye area cured my eye eczema",1570496330.0,0.92,8
Starting Differin need advice! [Acne],"So I purchased a tube of Differin (0.1%) and a little tub of Cerave night cream. I've been researching Differin for the past week for tips and tricks involving Differin usage but I'm still nervous/unsure. My current routine is as follows:

In high school I had really bad bacne.  I did two courses of acutane and it absolutely was a miracle cure for me.  My back has been flawless ever since and now I’m starting to panic that it’s all coming back.  I need help troubleshooting!  

As soon as I got back from my honeymoon I bought the Murad Acne Body Wash and use it once a day with a salux towel.  I wash my back after I’m done with my hair, and I don’t let my hair touch my back.  I’ve also made sure my sheets and towels are clean.  Do you think think this could be a reaction to something from my vacation? Has anyone else experienced a sudden and severe outbreak on their back and gotten it under control? Did you find out what the cause was? Is there anything else I could be doing? Your advice is much appreciated!",1570494995.0,1.0,5
[Product Question] DE Protini vs. SR Tidal,"Hello SCA! 

As a budget-conscious person with oily skin, I have always used Neutrogena Hydro Boost morning and night for my moisturizer. I always thought with oily skin, this moisturizer was the only thing that would be light enough, and I knew to stay away from heavy cream-based moisturizers.

Enter my free DE Protini sample from Sephora. I wasn’t expecting much from it especially since it was creamier than the Neutrogena, but to my surprise my skin looked better and was less oily than it was with Neutrogena. After using this, I noticed my Neutrogena, when I would use it, would leave dry patches and my skin would pill. I don’t love the price tag, but wondering what this means in terms of my skin’s needs?

Additionally, I received a few months back a sample of the Sunday Riley Tidal. The girl at Sephora told me it would work magic for my skin and I loved the sample. I just got the full size tub of it, and I was so excited...but... my skin is somehow extremely oily with it on. It’s discouraged me from using it during the daytime and save it exclusively for night. Can anyone provide their opinion on this product?

Anyways, can anyone provide insight on why Neutrogena is suddenly leaving dry patches on my oily skin and DE Protini is leaving me less oily than any moisturizer has before? 

Routine info if it helps?
Morning
-splash water on face (washing morning and night leaves me extremely dry)
-aczone 
-moisturizer 

Night
-remove makeup
-CeraVe foaming facial cleanser
-onexton
-moisturizer

[Misc] Non-propanediol or low-propanediol alternatives to The Ordinary's antioxidants available in the EU?,"Many of you noted that the common irritation from The Ordinary's antioxidant line (at the time of writing this means Resveratrol 3% + Ferulic Acid 3%; Pycnogenol 5%; Alpha-lipoic acid 5%; and EUK-134 0.1%) can arise from the high propanediol content. I often have red patches from these products, which I need to treat with hydrocortisone, regularly. I also get these patches from Vitamin C 23%, so I use just tiny amounts sparingly. Yes, I am on the sensitive side.

[Acne] Accutane the only possible treatment for me?,"Hi there,

I'm a 26y old male and have never really had issues with my skin (not even in my teen years). Since about 6 months I'm really bothered by terrible blind pimples, those that are under the skin and almost impossible to pop. I did get those sometimes before (about once a year). After I had some of those begin this year (about 3 in 6months - wasnt worried about it then, thought it was still coincidence I got those). By june I got one that was the worst I've ever had. It was completely inflamed, turned black (blood filled, yeah I also tried to pop it one time, really bad, I know, but Ive never had problems with it afterwards like with this one). I went to a dermatologist with it and told him I've got some more blind pimples the last months. First treatment he offered for my problem: accutane. I was still thinking that it was coincidence I got a few of those pimples last months, and that my problem would be solved when that huge cyst was gone. He prescribed me clindamycin for that spot, but it did pop the same day (was a deep cut and left me with a bad scar). The problem wasnt over, it was just the beginning. I was still getting those blind pimples afterwards. The only area Ive got those are my cheeks. I made an appointment with a skin therapist to treat those (let them pop with a sterile needle) and made an appointment with another dermatologist (I couldnt believe accutane was the first possible treatment for my problem). When I went to the new dermatologist I didnt had any active blind pimples, only 1 that did came to the surface (and looked like it wasnt that deep) and the scars I have now (both pie and pih). She prescribed me tretinoin, I was worried for the purge (think it will be a purge of blind pimples for me?) at first. Had a new appointment really soon after (by then only used tret twice on my problem area), and that day I just had a new blind pimple. She told me topical treatment wont help this, and I need oral medication. Im on doxycycline now with topical differin. She told me it's likely the doxy will only help me when I'm on it, and possibly will come back when I stop. But she wanted to try it first before accutane, the treatment she suggested when doxy wont help. So 2 dermatologist both suggested me accutane. Looks like I have to go for that... While I never had skin issues before about 6 months ago. Also I've got a new one once a month for the last 6 months, so its not like new cysts everyday. And right now I have only one active big cyst and rest is really noticible scars (accutane wont help that right?) But the impact on my quality of life is huge. This is a pic of what the blind pimples look like I get these days (not me found this pic here on reddit):
https://i.redd.it/u3sgx33b0lj01.jpg

Some more info:
- only the blind pimples (cysts) bother me, i do get some normal pimples now and then, but dont bother me.
- depressed now, but thats because of my skin problems.
- ive already have some visual problems (brain related problem), like visual snow and floaters but used to those now. Was also depressed when I just had those, but not anymore when I got used to it. Yeah Im a bit worried of the mental side effects of accutance, but both depressions were related to a problem, and were not out of nowhere.
- as I have a lot of scars and just 1 active pimple, it will be hard to keep motivated (because accutane probably will only help the active pimple). That I wont get new pimples has to keep me motivated, but i think seeing your skin clearing up is a better motivation (and I dont expect to really see that happening with my pie and pih scars)

Do you think accutane is the best option for me?",1570488782.0,1.0,1

[Skin Concerns] Man with ingrown hairs in beard line. Any tips? (picture),"Picture: [https://imgur.com/a/ZHEmRcI](https://imgur.com/a/ZHEmRcI)

Hi,

I have been struggling with acne my entire young adult life, and after 3 (!) isotretinoin/accutane courses I luckily dont get more of that cystic acne.

However, I have some issues in my cheeks that still persist -and I want to get rid of this issuess before I think about treating my acne scars - I get a lot of ingrown hairs where my beard line goes.

They often result in infections, scars and ugly skin, AND I can't keep myself from trying to remove them with tweezers. I know, it sucks, and I'm an idiot.

I'm on Zalna as prescribed by my derm (combined clindamycin and tretinoin gel), and I dont feel like it's helping a lot.

&#x200B;

My routine is as follows:

PM:

\-Shower

\-CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion

\-LRP Anthelios anti-imferfections sunscreen

AM:

\-CeraVe hydrating cleanser

\-CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion

\-Wait 15min

\- Thin layer of Zalna (combined clindamycin and tretinoin gel)

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any tips for products/changes to my routine (apart from leaving the hairs alone and stop picking)? :)

[Personal] Oil-Free Monday!,"Ok, so I'm here to share the wonderful result of a long skin care routine from last night and this morning.

P.S. I'm 16, I have oily skin, and my skin usually gets slightly oily throughout the day, despite moisturizing in the morning.

Steps from Last Night:

1. I did a ""pre-wash"" with warm water to remove surface dirt/grime.

2. I used The Seaweed Detox Bath Co. Purifying Gel Cleanser, and washed off with warm water.

3. I used my Andalou Naturals Turmeric + C Enlighten Serum (I pressed it into my face and neck, rather than massaging - it dries slower and doesn't leave my face dry this way)

4. I used my Andalou Naturals Pumpkin Honey Glycolic mask (20 minutes, since my skin can surprisingly tolerate the enzymes and the AHA).

5. I used my Thrive Face Balm (it's a great moisturizer for men with a bunch of plant extracts).

6. I finished my routine by sealing in everything with argan oil (I also pressed it into my face and neck).

Today my skin was a little oily when I woke up, but that's kind of normal. I followed the same routine this morning (minus the mask and argan oil), and my skin has never felt better.

I personally feel like last night's routine made my morning routine more effective. I love my moisturizer, but rarely does it leave my skin matte all day. It's nice to feel that instant gratification from a process that usually takes weeks to see.",1570474803.0,0.67,1

[Routine Help] My entire body is breaking out in acne since I have started working out pretty hardcore and I am at a complete loss as to what to do. Product recommendations?,"Hi all,

The last several years I've had my body acne in check. It was never too bad, just some casual issues under my breasts or upper shoulders but thats it. However, in this time period I also was rarely active enough to work up a sweat as I was having some health issues.

The last 3 weeks, I've started consistently following a build up cardio/strength training plan from my pre-sick days and I am working up a damn good sweat. Like, dripping all down my face, sweat stains on my shirt, etc.

PROBLEM is that my body is breaking out bad. Like, my arms, my butt, my face worse than usual, my HS is also flaring up under my breasts and arm pits. I work from home and workout at my apartment gym. So I come in and shower and scrub/wash really good right after. I don't let the sweat sit. But still I have major issues.

I ordered the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc soap bar because I've heard on this sub it works well. I also am currently using the Alpha Skincare AHA Body lotion, but wondering if thats cause worse problems.

For my face, I use Altreno (RX tret brand) and finally am back on my HG chemical exfoliation, DE TLC night serum, which is starting to help my face.

I guess my question is, should I be using anything else? Do y'all have any recommendations for these problems?

[Acne] I am Out of Medication Options and Looking for Help," 

Hello Everyone,

I am truly at my wits end and do not really know where else to turn. A little hesitant to share photos of my bare skin on the internet but I am in the hopes someone can help. I will start with some skin care history and background so its more clear why I am so frustrated.

**Teens/Early College:**

I have had acne since I was about 16. I traditionally had very bad cystic acne around my chin and sometimes would get whiteheads around my nose. The cystic acne went all the way up the sides of my chin as well as the chin itself and was angry and red. I initially tried pretty much every Seventeen magazine-suggested acne routine and ended up having red constantly angry dry skin from all the products I was using.

I eventually went to a dermatologist who prescribed Doxycycline and I took that for literally YEARS. YES YEARS. All throughout college. I would go off and on it, never really tried any topicals. It would work for a while and then I would get horrible cystic acne again and then go back on it and so on. I heard about oil cleansing from a friend and gave it a try and thus the second era of skin care beings.

**2016-2018**

I started doing this in 2016. I had my own custom oil blend of 2 parts castor oil, one part jojoba oil, 5 drops of tea tree oil, and two drops of another oil I cannot remember that was for hyper-pigmentation spots. This for some weird reason just WORKED. My acne went away almost overnight. I cleansed with this morning and night and used a basic cerave moisturizer for two years. Never had an issue, no more cysts and maybe one-two pimples during my period but that was really it.

**2018-Now**

One day the oils stopped working. Honestly just out of the blue I started getting the acne again and with a vengeance. It was covering my chin and was red and angry and painful cysts. I went to a dermatologist who put me on spironolactone, aczone, and differin gel. This worked for a while! I still had a few here and there but the cysts were mostly under control. My skin was just super dry. Late 2018 the spironolactone stopped working. I broke out in terrible cysts everywhere again and also whiteheads also all over my t-zone. I ended up doubling my dose of spiro in January of 2019 but that took a toll on my body in other ways. I have been advised by doctors to not revisit this medication due to its adverse effects. I went on minocycline instead and that worked for a while also but now, in October of 2019, it no longer works with my topicals. My skin is different now than it used to be also. The acne is no longer tons of painful cysts. I have some cysts on my chin (you can see in the photos) but I actually just have TONS of little whiteheads that pop up ALL DAY. Literally I am always popping them. I also have a terrible texture to my skin and my forehead feels like it has tons of pimples just hanging out right under the surface that then pop up randomly. My skin feels so oily and honestly just gross and nothing I seem to do really helps. Photos of my skin today are here: [https://imgur.com/a/99krmVJ](https://imgur.com/a/99krmVJ).

I really am not sure what my options are in terms of oral acne treatments. I really don't think my skin is at the point where I need to go on accutane, and quite frankly I think it might do more harm than good. **Any advice would be super helpful.** I think I am just out of ideas. I am seeing my dermatologist again today but not sure what he could really prescribe because he always suggests 1. spironolactone 2. doxycycline or 3. accutane.

Also note: I do not take BC pills.",1570471842.0,0.5,7

[Acne] Routine/advice to wear foundation every day without breaking out?,"I have come a long way in my relationship with my skin (many thanks to this subreddit!) and I actually don't mind going out without foundation. However, I still love wearing make up and don't ever plan to stop.

With that said, has anyone developed a routine, habits or tips about how to prime your skin before makeup or cleanse/treat your skin after a day of high coverage foundation to prevent pore blockage, closed comedones and the like?

My current routine:

AM:

1. Benzagel cleanser (5% benzoyl peroxide)
2. Hada Labo Hyaluronic Acid Lotion
3. TO Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% (when I finish I'm moving on to the TO Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres) and sometimes the TO Salicylic Acid if I'm looking for more acne-fighting
4. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion
5. Tony Moly Sunscreen Watery Essence SPF 50

**6. FOUNDATION: Huda Beauty Faux Filter** (I love that I only need a tiny bit with a beauty blender and I get amazing high coverage with a hypnotic ""my skin but better"" finish! If you can recommend a better everyday foundation I would really appreciate it since it is a pretty heavy and highly fragranced foundation) I typically don't use primer/setting powder/setting spray for fear of clogging pores.

PM:

1. Shu Uemura cleansing oil (blanc:chroma)
2. Benzagel cleanser
3. TO Glycolic Acid Toner (3-4x a week)
4. Hada Labo Hyaluronic Lotion
5. Prescribed tretinoin
6. Cerave PM
7. Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion

[Skin Concerns] What should someone prone to ingrown hairs / cysts do when shaving?,"Hello. I'm hoping this is the right sub for this, but I couldn't find one that exactly fit.

When I was a teenager I had a pilonidal cyst (ingrown hair at the bottom of your spine / top of your butt that becomes very painful and (often) has to be surgically removed). Because of this I've always since tried to be relatively thorough in cleaning that area. Within the past year I've started to shave my pubic area and ass because it makes me feel a lot more comfortable, clean, and attractive. I've  done this several times but I generally just use a trimmer that I clean off every time instead of using a razor and do it every two to three months. In the past couple of days, however, I've developed a fairly painful bump/cyst in my pubic area and one about midway up my butt. I have occasionally gotten less painful bumps but never associated them with shaving, just assumed they happen since I'm generally hairy and apparently genetically prone to cysts. Since these ones are particularly bad, I'm looking for some advice on what I should do, particularly these questions:

1. Is this related to shaving? I shaved about a week and a half ago and they didn't develop until the last 3 days. 

2. Should I apply some sort of lotion before shaving? What lotion is recommended? What about after?

3. Is there anything different I should do when shaving to prevent this? Or anything I should look out for in the days/weeks after shaving while the hair regrows?

4. Is there any product recommended for treating these until they go away in a few days?

5. Should I just got ahead and get laser hair removal done? I have to deal with so much headache because of my body hair and it seems like it might just be worth it to do this. If so, does anyone have any experiences with info like how long it works for, how expensive it is, risks, etc?

PSA: stop overmoisturizing your face [Skin concerns],"This isn't a question or concern or anything, this is just for whoever needed to hear it. Stop overloading your face with moisture.

I thought it was helping me but it just made my pores clogged and look huge, exacerbated the look of my acne starring and I just looked greasy instrad of healthy and dewy. I thought that was just my skintype and I had to live with it. But very recently I decided to reduce my use of moisturizers and see what happened. I don't have perfect skin at all, but the appearence of it improved dramatically. It looks glowly and not oily, and my pores and acne scars don't look as drastic.

On Saturday evening, I did my usual routine and put the solution under my eyes and immediately I felt it sting under my left eye. I didn't think much of it then because the stinging passed after some time.

On Sunday I woke up and felt instantly that it's kind of painful to blink with my left eye, I noticed a small swelling in the outer corner of my eye. And now today the swelling has gotten a bit worse, but it's less painful today.

My eye itself is fine, but just lower eye lid is swollen.

Hey, I have been dealing with mild-moderate acne for almost one year, I read about benzoyl peroxide online and started using it(2.5% for almost 3-4 months, didn't see much change, one used to heal and other one used to show up, later I upped the strength to 5% and still didn't see any change, so I finally went to the dermatologist in June and he recommended me to go on Accutane but because I have keratoconus (an eye condition), I can't (nothing in my life can go right).
So he put me on azithromycin (500mg 3days in a week) for one month, I really hated that period, I literally felt dead inside; barely could workout, killed my appetite etc. but I stuck with it, and did see a significant change in my skin, almost all of them cleared up, after the prescription was over I went to the doctor again and he recommended me to keep using the benzoyl peroxide cream on what was left and gave me glycolic acid facewash. I stuck to this routine but after 2-3 weeks I started seeing acne again, this time I decided not to go on any antibiotics and check if it's my diet. I found that dairy and sugar,  are the biggest culprits, 
Now I don't consume any sugar or dairy but I do consume whey protein isolate so I  decided for a month to replace it with pea protein and see if it helps, after half a month on it I did see a change, almost 60% of them were gone and a lot less inflammation but that's it, they never completely healed, now since plant-based protein is incomplete protein my recovery from resistance training was suffering, therefore, I decided to go back to whey isolate and after few weeks on it acne which got better because of pea protein, are back.


It feels like I have to decide between healthy skin or my fitness goals. Help if there's anything that I can try :) 
I am pretty insecure about them and they are pretty painful.



P.S. I have been thinking of trying tretinoin gel to see if it helps. 

Thank you 🙇 in advance, I'll appreciate any input *-*",1570426628.0,0.67,4

[Skin Concerns] Need help with picking The Ordinary products and general advice for my acne and hyper-pigmentation,"Hi all I know this is going to be a long read but I would be forever grateful to any genuine advice!

I've  been struggling with acne since I was in middle school and I am now in  college and really sick and tired of it. It goes from severe to mild  throughout the years, and I have not been able to track down the source  whatsoever. It has been getting pretty severe lately and it's been my  main source of stress. I won't be providing photos because it is very severe at the moment and I am too embarrassed. I took some photos and it looks really really bad

I tried  cutting out certain food or adding to see if it's a diet problem and  nothing ever changed. I wash my pillows and bedding frequently and make  sure to use separate face towels and never touch my face and all that  but it hasn't made a difference for years. I haven't started using  makeup till couple years ago so it definitely wasn't makeup that caused  any problems. I have went from using almost no skincare products to  those complicated Korean skincare routines. It is not genetic either  because none of my family members or relatives struggle with acne or  even pimples (I also live in the same environment as them and eat the  same food which further contributes to the fact that diet is not the  problem). Please note that this has been a process ongoing for a decade  and I have tried all these things out gradually over months or years. I  have been to a dermatologist who gave me skincare products for my face  and it did nothing and actually gave me some chemical burns at one point  so I stopped going. Nothing has ever changed. Only thing I haven't  tried is going on Accutane or anything of the sort, but it's out of  question for me.

***------------------------------------***

So  now I am going to try The Ordinary since it is relatively cheap and I  can experiment around with various products. However, I need help with  deciding which products I should buy. I have already added a few to my  basket but I need to know which ones may clash with each other or won't  work well together.

***My skin information:***

\-Dry to normal

\-Acne mostly on cheeks but have been getting problems on my chin recently. Never on forehead or nose

\-Pretty  severe hyper-pigmentation and scarring on cheeks due to the acne. I  will receive hyper-pigmentation if I don't touch my pimples but will  receive scarring if I do anything to them. I used to pop them but I  received scarring from that so now I just let them be but now I have so  many purple and red spots on those areas that I did not touch.

***Products currently in my basket:***

\- [ The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% - 30ml ](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-azelaic-acid-suspension-10pct-30ml)

\- [ The Ordinary AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution - 30ml ](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-aha-30pct-bha-2pct-peeling-solution-30ml)

\- [ The Ordinary Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution - 240ml ](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-glycolic-acid-7pct-toning-solution-240ml)

\- [ The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% - 60ml ](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-niacinamide-10pct-zinc-1pct-60ml)

\- [ The Ordinary Lactic Acid 5% + HA 2% - 30ml ](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-lactic-acid-5pct-ha-2pct-30ml) 

Let  me know which products to add on or which ones to remove. A huge bonus  would be to tell me which order I need to apply the products in, but I  would be able to figure it out on my own eventually

Thank you so so much for any answers",1570425199.0,0.33,8
[Routine Help] Foundation + moisturizer = ?,"Mix of skincare and makeup related question but I’ve recently stopped using foundation because I’m decently happy with my skin now, but on days that I’d like a slight tint of colour I’ve been thinking about trying, as the title suggests, mixing in a bit of foundation to my moisturizer.

I have oily/combo, slight acne prone skin. 

Does anyone else do this? If so do you like it/do it often? What products are you using? Any suggestions?

[Acne] Can’t fund relief for my skin! The breakouts just keep coming...,"https://imgur.com/a/SiKrOPV

Sorry for the blackout. I tried to get everything to focus on the acne and not the rest of me. It might be weird sorry. 

This is my skin today. I’ve been trying to figure out wtf is going on with my face. Cysts places, weird texture, massive pores on my cheeks, blackheads, random CC’s and teeny bumps. I can’t seem to find a dermatologist that even gives a shit either. 

I thought maybe I had fungal acne so my current routine is as follows:

AM: Nizoral shampoo mask for a few minutes
Melazepam Azelaic Acid
CeraVe baby cream
Coola Matte Face Sunscreen

PM: If wearing makeup, Green Clean cleansing balm
Legit African Black Soap (to double cleanse or if my face just feels gunky)
Nizoral shampoo mask again
Melazepam Azelaic Acid
CeraVe Baby cream (if super dry, otherwise I skip)
Vaseline

So far, no irritation. But no improvement and it just seems my acne is getting worse or staying the same. I say it’s not irritated because it’s not overly dry or stingy. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m at a loss. I’ve literally tried everything except an entire routine of K Beauty brands. That’s it. Prescriptions, topicals, antibiotics, BC, you name it. 

My skin is shit and it’s making me depressed. Also everything scars even if I don’t touch it. I’ve had the same red marks on my face for years. They just keep building after every break out. I don’t even know what I used to look like. I’m so embarrassed and I’m SO TIRED OF MY FACE HURTING. 

I have only ever experienced relief when I was pumped with antibiotics when I was giving birth to my son. My skin was wonderful. But it came back as soon as I got home. Antibiotics seem to help but nothing else. 

I am down to the simplest of products I can manage mentally without wanting to just tear my face off and hope it grows back better. This is the simplest routine I’ve had since middle school. 

Am I missing something? Did anyone else experience this and come across a miracle? Is there something super obvious I’m missing?",1570424055.0,1.0,13

[Routine Help] needing help b/c even gentle cleaners make my face feel tight?,"I have combo (oily t zone, dry cheeks and sides) and sensitive, redness-prone / mild rosacea (haven’t been diagnosed but redness has always been an issue, I think due to sensitivity).

Long story short I used Lush’s Angels on Bare Skin since forever and stopped maybe 3,4 months ago when I noticed it was probably messing up my skin barrier. I tried OCM for a month but it messed up my skin. Created really bumpy texture on the sides of my cheeks / chin and I’ve been trying to fix it ever since :( now the bumps are turning into pimples
/ cystic acne type stuff on the sides of my face.


Decided to stop everything and start slowly from the beginning. I’m looking for a very gentle cleanser - La Roche Posay made my skin red so I think it was a niacin flush reaction. I’ve been using Vanicream gentle cleanser for a week and it kinda makes my skin tight at a level that feels kind of uncomfortable. I’ve slathered some Vanicream light lotion and as soon as it dries I’m gonna put some more lotion on.

What’s another gentle cleanser I can try, without niacinamide, that won’t make my skin dry? 

I think I’ll continue the Light Lotion. I switched to it from Ponds because Ponds was too thick but the Light Lotion is a little too thin for my taste I think. I’m just not sure what lotion to try next.
Every other day I’m doing the red Stridex just to try to make the pimples go away. It does make my skin feel tight too but I’m trying to control the bumps OCM gave me :(",1570419977.0,1.0,4

It’s the Reveal Me exfoliating gel from European wax center in case anyone was wondering or has used it. Years ago my wax tech told me it was the same thing as their face stuff so I figured I’d try it.. my skin looked great afterwards as I had a lot of dead skin that it took care of.. this was about a week ago and the breakouts started a few days later

So, I went through the sidebar links, and I read through that Acid Queen post about identifying skin types. I thought I had it sorted out.  
type: dry  
proclivities: dehydrated skin, rosacea  
conditions: dehydrated skin, acne (blackheads on my nose and forehead and chin, bumps on my jawline and forehead

But then! Then, I read through Labmuffin's articles about how to choose cleansers and moisturizers, and I saw that in her 'do you have dry or oily skin' moment, I have both from *both* categories. I bolded below what I have, and why I'm confused about what I should be doing for my skin.

Signs you have dry skin:  
**– frequent tight feeling, especially after washing**  
**– you are prone to powdery flaky patches of skin, redness and loss of elasticity**  
**– your skin is frequently dull**  
– premature lines  
– no visible pores  
– you need to apply moisturiser at least once a day  
– you don’t need to apply powder foundation

Signs you have oily skin:  
– your skin is frequently shiny  
**– you are prone to blackheads and pimples**  
**– you have big pores**  
– you can go without daily moisturiser without a skin freakout  
– you are a fan of powder makeup and blotting tissue

I actually avoided makeup for a long time (and still do) because of my skin--but now that I'm trying to figure it all out, it seems like my weird skin is just gonna keep causing me issues.

I have *huge* blackheads on my nose, chin, lips, and near my eyebrows, and on my cheeks near my nose. I have rosacea on my cheeks. My forehead and nose get flaky beyond *belief*, and end up all red.

[Routine Help] Critique Please!,"Hi all, 

Long time lurker-first time poster here! 👋🏻

I’m looking for ways to improve my routine. I’ve seen a TON of improvement in my skin from reading this sub the past year (thank you guys!) but I’m at a plateau and looking to keep the improvement going. 

Skin type: oily (not dehydrated, just genuinely oily) 

Skin issues: mostly looking to clear red PIE (I am fairly fair-skinned), but also even out my skin tone and address some closed comedones and occasional pimples.

AM: 

-Rinse with water

-Spritz face with Thayers Witch Hazel Facial Toner

-La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer

-Elta MD UV Clear Broad Spectrum SPF 46

-Makeup (Bare Minerals Original Loose Powder Foundation) 

PM: 

-Dry cleanse with CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser

-Spritz face with Thayers Witch Hazel Facial Toner

-Mad Hippie Vitamin C serum

-CosRx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence

-Avene Toleeance Eau Thermale Extreme (a suggestion for a cheaper alternative to this would be fantastic - I don’t think my skin is as sensitive as I originally thought it was)

-Every other night use Vaseline as an occlusive 

Some notes: 

-I’ve recently stopped using actives/exfoliants as I’d started to irritate my skin with overuse. I was originally alternating every night with Acure Radically Rejuvenating Facial Scrub and Stridex pads or CosRx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid (Scrub on one night, Stridex pads the next, Scrub next night, AHA the next night, Scrub, then Stridex again, etc) which my skin seemed to handle okay, but once I tried to use Stridex pads every morning instead of at night my skin started getting sensitive so I’ve stopped them altogether for about 2 weeks now. 

-I tried La Roche Posay Anthelios 60 sunscreen but I thought the texture was too oily, and went back to Elta MD. I only wish that Elta MD didn’t pill so much. Any suggestions for a sunscreen that doesn’t pill would be greatly appreciated! 

-I tried to use my Mad Hippie vitamin C serum in the morning, as I’ve read that vitamin C increases the efficacy of SPF, but it seemed to make the pilling worse, so I use it at night now. 

-I used to use SebaMed Clear Face Gel in the mornings, but felt that it just doesn’t give enough moisture, even for my oily skin. I added CosRx Snail Mucin to make it more moisturizing, but that would also make the sunscreen pilling worse, so I switched to La Roche Posay Toleriane Double Repair Face Moisturizer and like it enough.

[Routine Help] Dry and Dehydrated Skin causing Nasolabial Fine Lines,"Hi guys!

Recently, I've been running into alot of trouble with my skin as the weather has been becoming drier and colder. 

My routine:

1. Senka Perfect Whip cleanser
2. Nakeup Face Zero Stress Toner
3. Hyaluronic Acid serum from The Ordinary
4. Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream
5. Vaseline

The Hyaluronic Acid Serum used to work well with me, but it doesn't anymore and has been drying out my face. The Kiehl's Ultra Face Cream isn't really compatible with my skin either- it just feels like I'm lathering cream onto the outside layer of my skin, and my skin never absorbs any moisture from it. Whenever I smile and stop smiling, I get fine lines/imprints around my mouth that disappear after a few minutes or so. I'm not quite sure if my skin is dehydrated  or dry, or even both, but my skin does work well with oil-based/serum-based products rather than heavy creams.

I use tretinoin 0.05% religiously but feel as if additional exfoliation might help to slough off the turnover the tret helps with. My aesthetician says lactic acid on the daily (maybe in a toner or something) would be particularly helpful.

[Acne] CC breakout after neutrogena hydro boost hydrogel mask,"I'd classify my skin type as normal to dehydrated. I struggle with CCs on my forehead when I use too many layers of products or my skin is dehydrated, but I've got a severe breakout that I can't get rid of. I'm pretty sure they've come as a result of the Neutrogena moisture boost sheet mask I did, as it seemed to (ironically) suck ALL the hydration out of my skin. Honestly my skin has never felt so tight and dry. (Weirdly I don't think I get on with hyaluronic acid. This mask has confirmed that for me)

What can I do to get rid of them? I've stopped using actives in case that would make it worse but I'm thinking of introducing them again as it's been about 5 days now.

Hair: I also have dry hair and dandruff (I'm an African-American male with curly/coiled hair, but I'm not sure of my hair type). Shea Moisture does nothing for me, but my Head & Shoulders worked wonders in the past (though it's ingredients aren't great at all)

Face: I have oily skin with acne (most from puberty, I'm assuming). Parts of my skin looks ""holey"", and I'm guessing it's from the healing of past acne. I also have lines near my mouth that I can't seem to get rid of, and a slightly uneven skin texture.

[Routine Help] Need help adding actives back into my routine!," 

Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster!

I've been dealing with acne prone skin since I was in middle school. I always thought that I had oily skin because acne = oily, right?? I only recently realized that my skin is actually combo/dry and acne, and probably dehydrated. I love skin care, and I have accumulated quite a few products because I always thought that I just one active ingredient away from the skin I wanted.

Back in May, I decided to stop using all actives and just focus on repairing my moisture barrier. My skin seemed much happier (breakouts slightly less frequent, much less red and angry when it happened, skin looks more glowy) but my closed comedones and milia seemed to get worse. I also started getting painful cystic acne about a month or two after I gave up all actives.

I went to see my dermatologist about the cystic acne, and she prescribed 1% clindamycin lotion and 0.05% tretinoin cream. I have been prescribed both before in high school (along with an oral antibiotic), but I had trouble keeping up with a routine so stopped using them. They did help back then when I was consistent, so I have high hopes for my second go with retinol. I've been buffering my tret and easing in (1x per week for 1 week, 2x per week for two weeks, etc). I started 2 weeks ago so haven't really experienced any improvement or purging yet.

I've included my routine below, as well as a list of the other products I have. I'm wondering if I can include any of my other products into my routine along with tret and clinda without freaking out my skin, how I would add them in, if there are any other products I should consider (have been thinking of Benzoyl Peroxide or Vitamin C), and if there are any products that I should just straight up get rid of (I give the stuff that doesn't work for me to my friends).

This is super long so thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing y'all's thoughts!

My current routine is as follows-

Morning:

Cleanse with LRP toleraine hydrating gentle cleanser

Mix clindamycin and FAB ultra repair cream for moisturizer

Apply Paula's Choice super-light daily wrinkle defense (spf 30) if I'm going to be in the office or LRP anthelios 50 mineral if I'm going to be out in the sun.

Night:

Tret application night:

Remove makeup with Garnier micellar water (blue cap) (not super happy with this- won't be repurchasing; will probably go back to Boscia makeup breakup oil or banila co clean it balm. Haven't tried the clean it balm in the purifying version so I might try that. Open to oil based makeup remover suggestions! )

Cleanse with LRP Toleraine purifying foaming cleanser.

After face is completely dry, mix LRP cicaplast baume B5 with tret and apply all over.

Follow up with a layer of FAB Ultra Repair Cream, then a layer of Lucas' paw paw ointment as an occlusive,

Non tret nights:

Remove makeup with Garnier micellar water (blue cap) (not super happy with this- won't be repurchasing; will probably go back to Boscia makeup breakup oil or banila co clean it balm. Haven't tried the clean it balm in the purifying version so I might try that. Open to oil based makeup remover suggestions! )

And the new hair that grows back does not have thin ends (unlike the original hair). The few chin hair I've tweezed seem to confirm this - they appear darker and thicker.

[Routine Help] My skin hates water??,"My skin hates water??

So I’ve been struggling with really dry, painfully dehydrated skin. Nothing helps. I’ve been following the conventional advice here and elsewhere to apply moisturizer or hydrating toner to wet skin and follow up with an occlusive. But everything leaves my skin feeling tight and painfully dry. Sometimes to dryness is almost immediate, sometimes it feels okay for half an hour or so before feeling dry and tight again.

I don’t have a routine to speak of, because I try things out of desperation and give up on them when they don’t work.

Things I’ve tried that leave my skin drier than before:
-Hada Labo lotion
-CeraVe in the tub 
-Cetaphil
-Hada Labo in the gold tub
-Vaseline 

Things that seem to help a little:
-The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors 
-Indeed Laboratories Hydraluron Moisture Jelly

Last night I think I may have had a mini breakthrough. 

After cleansing I patted my face dry with a towel and then Hada Labo lotion, followed by a LARGE amount of The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors. My face felt great for maybe an hour or two before it started to feel a little tight. I put on some Indeed Hydraluron Moisture Jelly and it felt fine the rest of the night.

So basically, I think my skin doesn’t like being wet and loses all moisture as it dries. Towelling off my face before moisturizing really seemed to help.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any ideas on how to fix it?",1570372872.0,0.67,15

I would like to try a chemical exfoliator and the more I look up the more confused i get. I am completely new to this and more experience of exfoliation is with men\`s clarins exfoliator and shiseido deep cleansing scrub.

Wash face with water

"[Personal] I don’t want to speak too soon, but I am so grateful for this group","**Backstory / context:** After years of severe hormonal cystic acne due to PCOS (thankfully ultimately cleared up with anti-androgenic birth control), I continued to struggled with product-based acne which took me years more to clear. These struggles with my skin left me very anxious about products and left me only willing to use ones I knew were “safe,” which in my case were Basis sensitive skin bar cleanser and Paula’s Choice 2% salicylic acid toner. The toner did include glycerin and HA, but other than that I had no other moisture-supporting ingredients in my routine.

Shockingly, this routine worked for me for years and I had clear, plump, glowing skin... until last year I decided to add using a baby washcloth into my routine daily in order to achieve “peak glow.” Everything was fine at first, but in the winter I noticed my skin was starting to get dry and flaky, although I’d never had dry skin before. I thought I must need more exfoliation, and scrubbed at my face more. By April, I had dry, rough, burning patches on the inside of each cheek. I ditched the washcloth, but continued with the acids. 

This summer, I noticed I’d have days where inflamed patches of several bumps and raised red skin would crop up on my right cheek. I’d put hydrocortisone cream on them, and continue my routine. The bumps would come back, sometimes in the same form and sometimes as stubborn small dry bumps that looked like clogs. Then I thought, having only had experience with acne before, “I know my skin feels sensitive, but I know how to treat acne! Let me bring out the big guns!” On went the slatherings of benzoyl peroxide, clay masks full of multiple acids, and sulfur spot treatments with alcohol and more acids.

I’m sure those of you experienced with skincare can imagine what happened next. After a couple of rounds of this my entire cheek was visibly swollen, burning and bright red (I have brown skin, so this isn’t easy to accomplish!), and when I brought that swelling down, I found my cheek was covered in dozens of tiny bumps that looked like clogs, raised peeling patches, swollen redness, painful burning, sandpaper texture, and eventually, some larger bumps that looked like colorless pimples. Nothing had a visible head or extractable clog, and I was thoroughly confused (no less so after a derm visit in which the brusque doctor told me I needed a retinol to resurface my cheeks, even as I said “my face is red and burning and raw; I don’t think I can put a retinol on it!” — tbh I cried as I walked home from that appointment).

**Enter this sub:** Over the past few weeks, I estimate that I spent 40+ hours researching here and on various websites linked here, at which point I finally learned about dehydrated skin, the moisture barrier, how thoroughly I must have destroyed mine, and the potential effects of doing so in a major way — aka, exactly what I was seeing on my own face. I decided to cut out everything except my cleanser, start testing a gentler cleanser on my left cheek (Vanicream gentle cleanser), and get a few barrier-repairing products such as Stratia liquid gold, Eucerin 5% urea cream, etc. and start putting them through my long patch-testing process (elbow >> neck near ear >> forehead >> cheek).

On Friday afternoon, I came home, looked at my skin full of bumps and flakes and cracks, and was desperate to do something. But at the same time, given how acne-prone my skin is, I knew it would be a mistake to just start slathering unknown moisturizers over my face without completing my patch testing. So I decided to start testing a DIY 5% glycerin / water solution on my right cheek where the worst of the damage was (since I knew glycerin was helpful to me from its presence in my PC toner). I didn’t top with an occlusive bc the humidity here was 75% and tbh I was scared after a bad experience with mineral oil.

Guys. **I have applied the glycerin / water mixture just THREE TIMES (Friday night, Saturday morning, and Saturday night) and at least 50% of the bumps are gone. My face doesn’t hurt or burn or itch for the first time in weeks.** A couple of the bumps have now surfaced as whiteheads, of course some of the bumps are still there, and I can feel that my skin will still need significant time for healing and additional healing products to support it beyond just a humectant. But for the first time since this issue started getting really bad this summer, I feel hope. I was so confused about what was happening to my face,  unsure if I had “regular” acne or fungal acne or dermatitis or rosacea or what, and now I feel like I at least have a direction to move in. Thank you for all your guidance and contributions!!!! Going forward, I vow to treat my facial skin as gently as I’d treat a baby’s, and to speak to and treat it with love rather than trying to fight against it. 

**TL;DR:** If you have been treating your face harshly, not all your “acne” may be acne or benefit from standard acne treatments. Dehydrated skin with damaged barrier can lead to bumps that resemble CCs and acne (as well as actual acne due to the compromised barrier), and eliminating aggravating products like acids and harsh cleansers, and adding humectant ingredients like glycerin made a huge difference for me in just 2 days. I will continue to test actual barrier repair products now to hopefully incorporate them into my routine.",1570367121.0,0.91,10

[Product Question] Anyone else that azelaic acid DIDN'T work for?,"I've been using Skinoren (prescription 20% AA cream) for 6 months now in the hopes of tackling mild hormonal acne, PIE and PIH. I've varied my method of application to see if I could get better results (i.e. tried it under moisturizer, over moisturizer, every other day, every day, etc for at least a month at a time) and have seen no noticeable improvement. 

I stopped using it altogether about a week and a half ago and since then, my PIE looks a lot less red, PIH looks smaller, and I haven't broken out other than a couple small cysts on my chin (which is to be expected around this point in my cycle for me). While I didn't experience any tingling/peeling while using the AA (other than the first few applications 6 months ago), I feel like it must have been irritating my skin all this time which is probably why I haven't experienced any improvements from my routine.

[Acne] Sudden acne after antibiotics (doxycycline/Doryx) when skin was almost clear before the medication? Help!,"Hey all! Mid 20sF here.  


So I was put on doxycycline for a few weeks as a precaution for a non-skin related infection.  


Over the past few years, my skin has been pretty ok. Occasional rosacea flareups, the odd hormonal spot, some marks left from a random bout of acne that started on one cheek and spread to the other (nowhere else on my face) a few years ago, dryness and flakiness on the cheeks since then but nothing major.

&#x200B;

But within 1 week of coming off doxycycline, my face has been covered in tiny bumps worse than I ever had as a teenager, including in areas I never had any trouble. My forehead has lots of bumps (more skin-coloured than anywhere else), but my cheeks have flared up really badly and it's spread to my temples which were previously clear of spots and were the same colour and smooth texture as the skin near my eyes (top right), but are now completely red and covered with the bumps. The only place that seems to be completely unaffected is my chin, where I normally get hormonal spots. 

Bigger spots have also started appearing on my chest/shoulders/back where I used to have a lot of spots, and my neck too.

My skin almost constantly feels warm to the touch, my lips are stinging constantly, there are bigger spots on my cheeks, oil production seems to be up, and this is really messing with my confidence. I was finally getting comfortable with my skin!

&#x200B;

The picture doesn't do it justice. I do plan on seeing a doctor, but nobody warned me this could happen nor did the pamphlet. It's been 2-3 weeks. I actually had more problems with my skin being dry and sensitive, so I used regular light Simple moisturisers with the occasional face scrub, cleansers (usually soap-free), and do have some tea tree and witchhazel/aloe vera toners, as well as a Clinique combination oily kit with salycilic acid I didn't really have to use anymore.

&#x200B;

Is there anything I can do to my skin that can help? And if so, can anyone back this up with any science/links?

[Product Question] What made you decide to start Accutane?,"I'm a college student with Fitzpatrick type III (Asian), oily, acne-prone skin. I've been suffering from moderate cystic acne since high school, but it's gotten worse/more frequent since I got to college a few years ago. I usually have a cystic lesion or two on my face at any given time.

I've run the gauntlet of treatment over the years, trying conventional prescription treatments like antibiotics and retinoids. I'm off the antibiotics now and am currently on Tazorac .05%.

My routine is currently:

AM:

La Roche Posay foaming cleanser

Vanicream Lite Lotion

Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 (if I have any with me in my dorm room lol)

PM:

LPR foaming cleanser

Tazorac .05%

Vanicream Lite Lotion

I've just discovered this sub, so I'm learning a lot as I go. There's definitely a lot to take in here! I'm beginning to get very frustrated with my skin- I genuinely thought that it'd be ""just a phase"". It's definitely a knock on my self-confidence, like it is for many others on this sub. I'm considering how I should move forward. I'm a bit wary of hopping on Accutane, as I've read that it's typically reserved for more severe cases of acne. I'm curious to hear what you guys would do if you were in my shoes. Thanks!",1570334299.0,1.0,5
[Skin Concerns] laser hair removal side effect," 

Hi guys, I've seen a couple of posts related to this but nothing seemed to answer my question.

So years ago my mom took me to this dermatologist who gave me a laser treatment to remove my facial hair. This dermatologist did not have me come in on a cycle like I should've so that might've caused this problem. It seemed to work well for me at first until the last time my facial hair started growing thicker especially around my chin area and it felt like I was growing a beard. I can't shave my face because the hairs are so thick and stubbly it'd still show some discoloration. It grows so fast like overnight fast and I have hyperpigmentation and sometimes ingrown hair. I've been using a face epilator every day but it really bothers me how I cant even go on a trip without bringing the epilator with me. My pores are huge and I think its more susceptible to cystic acne. I've talked about it to my primary doctor and she said it looked like I had PCOS, but I got blood tests and the results were negative.

I went to another dermatologist and she told me that there's a stronger type of laser that can fix this but I'm currently unemployed and can't afford it.

Okay, my questions are:

1. does anyone know what condition this is? I want to do some research on it but I can't find anything about it
2. how can I deal with this in the meantime? I know for hyperpigmentation I gotta wear a hat and sunscreen and avoid sunlight but I'm wondering what is the reason for my hyperpigmentation so I can treat it correctly.
3. has anyone on youtube talked about this?

[acne] i quit benzoyl peroxide and my skin is a mess,"i’ve had moderate to severe acne since i was a teenager(i’m almost 28 now). a lot of those years i used benzoyl peroxide because it was the only thing over the counter that really worked for me. this year i noticed it’s not working as well for me anymore, and i had been considering quitting it anyways because i was sick of it bleaching my hair line/eye brows and worrying about ruining towels and clothes. so after i ran out of my face wash that i used (clean & clean continuous control 10% BP) i switched to the cerave SA cleanser & SA moisturizer. now my skin has erupted into painful bumps all over, but mostly in my chin/mouth area. i know there’s like an adjustment period bc your skin gets dependent on BP when you use it as long as i did, but i’m afraid my skin is going to be like this forever 😩 and it’s still soooooo oily, it sucks. i think the BP dried out my skin so bad it has to compensate by overproducing oil. i haven’t used BP in like a month now but i’m still breaking out and worried i’ve permanently damaged my skin. i’ve tried everything it feels, niacinamide, salicylic acid, clay masks, glycolic acid, etc nothing seems to fight acne like BP did but i refuse to go back on it. i had my hormone levels tested a couple years back and everything came back fine. i haven’t changed my diet, but i do eat like trash at times. i don’t want to go on birth control again and i don’t need it. i considered going to a dermatologist but idk how much it would cost or what my insurance would cover. i would consider going on accutane if the opportunity presented itself but for the reasons i just stated i don’t know if that would be an option either. i’m not sure what to do at this point except maybe bite the bullet and finally go see a dermatologist. any input would be great, tysm",1570332265.0,0.96,36
[Routine Help] Over-exfoliation with Dermalogica micro-foliant?,"I have consistently used the Clinique 3-step system (cleanse, clarify, moisturize) for oily combination skin for a couple years and it works well. In the spring I added Nature Valley's hyaluronic acid serum before the moiturize step, and my skin felt and looked great. Then in July I added Dermalogica's daily microfoliant to the mix at nights and after about 2 weeks things took a wrong turn. 

(FYI, I would use the Clinique face wash, followed by Dermalogica micro-foliant (at nights only). I'd pat dry my face then use the Clinique clarifying lotion, then the HA serum + a little water then finally use the Clinique moisturizer. I'd do all steps except the micro-foliant in the morning)

I think the combination of products ruined my skin. Specifically, I think the combo of the Clarifying lotion and micro-foliant did. One side of my face had terrible acne for 2 months with more blackheads than I've ever had. My skin is just now recovering and, of course, I have awful acne scarring. I still look like Two Face, but thankfully the scars are fading.

Have you had a similar experience using the Dermalogica micro-foliant with other products? How did you heal your skin? What is responsible use of the micro-foliant? It says it can be used daily, but maybe not with other actives?

[Product Question] Stratamark/Strataderm or Stratamed for stretch marks + microneedling?,"A dermatologist suggested I use microneedling and Stratamark to improve the look of some old and new stretch marks that I have, but I'm tempted to buy something else I found while researching online. I need some advice!

The same company that makes Stratamark/Strataderm* also makes Stratamed which looks to be for fresh wounds/early scars and can be used on broken skin. Both products are silicone scar gels but they have different ingredients and Stratamed happens to be about twice as expensive. 

The needles on the microneedling roller I have are only 0.5mm, but I'm worried I might accidentally cause bleeding from time to time, in which case I know I could only use Stratamed. My concern is would Stratamed be as effective on my old stretch marks as my new ones?

I wouldn't mind paying for the more expensive Stratamed if it would make a significant improvement in both my old and new stretch marks over just Stratamark/Strataderm. Which of the two would make more sense to purchase?

*Based on the ingredients list and the price, I'm assuming Strataderm and Stratamark are identical products, just marketed for different uses? Please correct me if I'm wrong!",1570328662.0,1.0,3

Best exfoliant for sensitive dry skin? [routine help],"Hi all. I’m looking to add exfoliant into my routine but I have very sensitive skin that can get very dry and flakey and I worry this will make it worse. 

My current routine is: simple hydrating gel cream, Neutrogena sun screen, differin, Clinique face soap extra mild, and cetaphil gentle makeup remover. 

I have a lot of closed comedones on my forehead and hope to get rid of them with exfoliation. 

I don’t apply differin around my eyes or on my nose because these areas are prone to flaking and differin makes it worse. But the rest of my face tolerates differin. 

I’m also currently trying to find a moisturizer that’s more moisturizing but I have a lot of ingredient restraints. 

The ingredients I am sensitive to and cause breakouts or an allergic reaction are: alcohols (especially cetearyl and cetyl alcohol), petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, hyaluronic acid, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, anything derived from coconut, argan oil, and jojoba oil.

Also do you apply an exfoliator around your eyes? Or do you typically avoid that area? Thanks!

[Acne] Need Help Clearing Up My Chin After Shaving,"Hey guys

* **The issue(s)** So I grow fairly noticeable hair on my chin and lip, which is unpleasant for a girl. The hair removal creams made for the face haven't worked and I'm worried to try anything harsher chemically, so I decided to shave the hair. Since then, I have constant breakouts that turn into whiteheads all around my chin, jaw, and upper lip.
* **Skin type**. Combination. Dry on my cheeks, around my nose and the sides of my jaw area. Oily everywhere else.
* **Current routine** [Garnier micellar water](https://www.garnier.ca/en-ca/face-care/beauty/garnier/micellar/micellar-cleansing-water-sensitive-skin) followed by [Olay Fresh Effects Dew Over Hydrating Gel Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Olay-Hydrating-Gel-1-7-Oz/dp/B00HD7SCLM).

[Product Question] Has anyone heard of RevivSerums?,"So, I recently bought some products from SkinMedica and Skinceuticals because I've read so much about them and how amazing they are and I'm nearly 40 so I'm trying to not look my age. The only thing is, man their stuff is expensive! Especially the TNS serum. So I went online to see if I could find alternatives (I really wish I'd done this before buying, but you know... sales people at the spa made me feel like the crypt keeper). Anyways, I ran across this website for a brand called RevivSerums and the descriptions for their serums sound AMAZING. BUT. I've never heard of them before. And their website is pretty cheesy. And most of their reviews seem to be from beauty bloggers who are paid for their reviews and given free product. If they're stuff is really as good as those other brands, it's a great deal! But it's still not cheap. So I thought I'd turn to reddit to see if any of you had heard of them, or know of other less costly alternatives.

Help my skin? [Skin concerns],"So I've had PERFECT and i mean PERFECT skin up until I was in grade 12.  I would get the occasional pimple here and there and had blackheads on my nose, but my skin was soft and looked like a baby's butt.  I would use the clinique gentle cleanser and some Cetaphil for moisturizer and thats it.

And then grade 12 came along and i guess the stress of getting into universities hit me like a truck.  I got so much more pimples, not as bad as people with severe acne, but much more than i would normally get.  They would go away but leave a red mark on my skin after they leave.  My skin also became suoer dehydrated.  It would look like a pot of oil ready for frying but at the same time, it would feel sooooo tight.  I see almost web-like shreds neer the sides of my nose, thats where i feel most of my tightness.

I switched my cleanser to the squalene boissance cleanser and use Cetaphil day cream for my face.  Ive tried numerous serums, moisturizers, exfoliants, but everything either broke me out or just didnt work.

And yes, i would use the products for well over a month to see if they made any difference but no luck.

ive noticed my skin feels extra extra tight and heavy when i wear sunscreen.  I tried several sunscreens to see if anything felt different but they would all feel thick on my skin and id always break out in someplace because of them.

I live in Canada so i dont know if its because of the weather, but i went to Lebanon for 1 month, and during my time there, i did not use any cleanser, moisturizer, or sunscreen and my skin felt so much better and looked so much better.  

But when i got back to Canada, my skin felt too tight to continue without my skincare.

I always have a few pimples on my face no matter what now plus all the other scars from other pimples that dont disappear no matter what.

I started at a new school so, unlike before at my old school where I'd go in without makeup and not worry about what people thought, I need to wear some to at least look somewhat presentable and now that my face looks awful, going without makeup, even if I were still at my old school, is literally not an option. I'm so insecure about my skin that I even wear makeup to the gym and I know that it does more harm than good but the few times that I did go without it, for the entire time I was outside the house, all I wanted to do was run home and cry. it's not at all helped by how my skin picking habit has, unsurprisingly, worsened as a result but I'm working on it. I've done lots of things to help fix my skin, eating more healthily, cutting out dairy, washing my makeup brushes after every use, lying on my back instead of on my side, not using as many products, but to no avail and I'm running out of options :( I'd love to go to see a dermatologist but they're pretty expensive and I'm still a student.

[Miscellaneous] Mental health and skin care,"I've noticed a few posts recently and have had my own personal struggles that have really gotten me thinking about the relationship between mental health and our passion for skin care. For example, I am being treated for severe depression, anxiety, and OCD that I've dealt with my entire life. Only recently have I really developed a passion for skin care and researching products and ingredients. However, my OCD and anxiety have unfortunately adversely impacted this by taking my passion to a level of obsession that I realize is not healthy. Shameful amounts of money and time have been spent on ""perfecting"" my routine. 

That said, the improvement I've seen in my skin over the past couple months with the help of this sub has definitely helped with self-confidence and depression issues. I see this theme in posts all the time, which is wonderful!

[Routine Help] Hyaluronic + Azelaic Acid for Dehydrated Skin?,"I'm new to this reddit, so I apologize for any formatting issues.  

My story:  I have dehydrated skin, and it's taken me forever to really figure this out because I was the opposite as a teenager. Currently, my routine is really simple because of my skin's sensitivity - in the morning, I use jojoba oil sealed with aloe vera gel, and then I use a microfiber cloth to wash with castile soap and repeat the oil + aloe at night. Every couple of days I use melazepam (azelaic acid) and seal my skin with medical-grade petroleum jelly for closed comedones. Despite having eliminated breakouts, my nose is still absolutely dreadful so I want to add in an HA.  

My questions: 

1) Should I be looking at something other than hyaluronic acid? I live in Arizona and I've read that HA will actually dry your skin out in dry environments. 

2) Is it okay to mix the azelaic acid with a hyaluronic acid? Should I eliminate the melazepam? 

3) If I use the two together, which order would I do everything in? Hyaluronic > Azelaic > Jojoba > Aloe? 

4) I'm a broke college student, so are there any recommendations for affordable hyaluronic acids or active blends for this context?  

Thank you so much!",1570315191.0,1.0,2

[Anti-Aging] Skincare Routine Help for Wrinkles at 23!,"After hours and days of research, I have come up with an \*ideal\* skincare routine for myself. I am afraid it might be too much. Looking for advice or some tweaks to help! I'll be sure to give updates on the weeks following.

Main concern: premature aging, trying to slow down and minimize my fine lines.

Stats:

* 23 y/o
* female
* caucasian
* normal/combo skin, not acne prone but zits here and there, some milia around eyes
* grew up in sunny California and did not wear sunscreen on my face until I was 21 and a bit too late (eek)

I started seeing fine lines on my forehead when I was 21. Now I am starting to also see smile lines.Full disclosure, I did use to hit a Juul for a few years and would party but when I noticed aging I quit everything (maybe will have 1-2 drinks once a month). I exercise regularly and eat a plant-based diet going on 3 years.

I am trying to see if I can reverse the effects of aging but I am worried I kind of *screwed myself* on this one from bad choices in the past...

In August I started getting monthly Microderm facials. I have had 4 sessions done. Results: my forehead wrinkles slightly diminished but my smile lines got noticeable.

Anyway, here is the routine I came up with with some help from my esthetician\*

**Morning:**

1. Double cleanse with MyChelle Fruit Enzyme Cleanser
2. Baking soda exfoliate \* 2x a week (might alternate this with other home remedies) (not on the week I get Microderm done)
3. Tone with diluted ACV\* (alternate with Thayer's Witch Hazel Rose Water Toner)
4. Aloe vera mask 10 minutes
5. Facial massage with alternating oils: cold-pressed olive + tea tree, lavender, rosehip (might get argan or grapeseed oil too..thoughts?) (also saw mixed reviews abt coconut oil)
6. Rinse the oil off than spritz Cocokind Rose Water\* on face
7. Apply Vitamin C Serum (Lilyana Naturals) + Jade Roll to penetrate product
8. MyChelle Vitamin C eye cream, seal in with Aquaphor
9. Moisturize with Nivea Creme from Germany (was using evanhealy Rose Vetiver Day Moisturizer but too pricey with all the other products I am purchasing)
10. MyChelle Replenishing Solar Defense SPF 30

If I am wearing Make-Up:

1. MyChelle Tinted Sun Shield Liquid SPF 50
2. Lily Lolo\* mineral make-up

**Night:**

1. Badger Damascus Rose Face Cleansing Oil
2. Cleanse with MyChelle Fruit Enzyme Cleanser
3. Dermarolling 3x a week with a .25mm (not on the week I get Microderm done)
4. Rinse with water then spritz Cocokind Rose Water\* on face
5. Apply Cosmedica Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum
6. MyChelle Remarkable Retinal Eye Cream (on days I don't dermaroll)
7. Moisturize with MyChelle Supreme Polypeptide Cream
8. Slug overnight with Aquaphor

Questions:

* Does anyone have positive results with taping?
* Does anyone slug their hands overnight?
* What oils do you recommend for facial massages?
* Is this too much?
* Where can I make tweaks?

I know this is a lot, so thank you if you read this thoroughly. I would love *advice, help, and support*. Very concerned that I have wrinkles at such a young age.

[ACNE] About a week into using just castor oil on my face and it's working out pretty well,"I've had acne my whole life and although it's calmed down as my hormones have actually calmed down I have still struggled with it (just not as intense as high school).

My routine has been Cerave with SA facewash and then Neutrogena noncomedogenic moisturizer. Only thing has been that sometimes it's hard to find in stores and in my plans for the future I don't necessarily want to be tied down by my skin routine so I decided to try castor oil.

I've had problems with cysts and castor oil always actually affected them unlike my normal washing routine.

So it's been a little more than a week of just washing my face with water, drying off and then applying castor oil. Sometimes I look a bit oily but my skin is overall oily so I'm used to it tbh.

My skin went through a little phase of bringing some pimples out but it's pretty clear now and my skins never been softer.

[Acne] Had clear skin ny whole life and now I've been breaking out nonstop since I turned 29. Today is the worst day yet. What can I do?,,1570312202.0,0.5,6
"[PSA] Sensitive, ""reactive"" skin? Visit an allergist!","My entire life I've had sensitive skin. Since I was a kid, I'd break out in hives all over my body several times a year. It happened so often that it became completely normal to me, and I just accepted it. I can't wear any clothing more than 12 hours or I'll get hives where the clothing touches my skin. I can't use most bandaids for more than a day without getting a rash and a dark mark that lasts for weeks.  I also learned to be very careful about what I'd put on my face since I'd randomly have really strong negative reactions. Sometimes this meant acne and breakouts (the fastest was a massive pimple exactly where I'd patch-tested a product a mere 6 hours later), and sometimes this meant [swelling, redness, itching, flaking, peeling nightmare skin](https://photos.app.goo.gl/heh6D9SsfmaxibfT7).

All the pictures of my face in that album are from one horrible week in 2016 where my face absolutely exploded. Why? I still don't really know. I'd only been using products I was familiar with and had been using regularly for months, nothing new for at least 6 months, only gentle products (Neutrogena makeup remover wipes, CeraVe moisturizer in the tub, Elta MD sunscreen). After 6 hours of trying to power through the extreme itching and pain, I ended up leaving work early and going to an urgent care clinic where I was referred for an emergency dermatologist appointment. They immediately sent me to the large hospital in the area, where I was prescribed level 10 steroids. These are very strong and must be used carefully, but they provided immediate relief. It took about a week, but finally my skin calmed down.

Fast forward to earlier this summer, when I was prescribed mupirocin for a staph infection on my ears. Applications burned and stung like the fire of a thousand bees. I immediately discontinued and told my doctor, who said she'd never heard of anyone having a bad reaction and told me to keep applying. A week later I went back for my follow-up where they realized I'm extremely allergic to mupirocin. I told the doctor these kinds of extreme reactions were pretty common for me, and she referred me to an allergist.

This has turned out to be fantastic for my skin and quality of life in general! I'm so glad I went and I'm so so sad I didn't do it earlier. It wouldn't have caught the mupirocin (that's not a common allergy so there's no test for it), but **my skin is so much happier now that I know what irritating ingredients to avoid, and what an allergic reaction even looks like!**

&#x200B;

# Here's how my allergy test worked:

The allergist did a patch test of many common allergies. This involved sticking 3 labeled patches to my back. I also had to stop taking my daily antihistamine which was much more uncomfortable than I thought it would be. She warned me the test might leave scars, especially if my skin ends up reacting to them. She explained that if spots itch, I should carefully remove that square and keep it so we know what I'm allergic to. I had to wear the patches for 4 days straight and avoid getting them wet (so no showers and no sweat-inducing activities like exercise). On the 4th day I went back and she pulled them off to look for reactions.

I reacted to 3 ingredients (and the tape - I'm often allergic to bandaids, sports tape, or other adhesives). The allergist listed them out for me:

&#x200B;

* Patch #1 - Nickel. A metal. Very common allergy. Means I can't wear cheap/costume jewellery, only sterling silver, gold, platinum, etc.
* Patch #23 Thimerasol. Something that used to be common in eye drops but has mostly been discontinued since so many people are allergic to it.
* Patch #29: Imidazolidanyl Urea (formaldehyde-releasing preservative). This was my strongest reaction and is an ingredient commonly found in skincare and cosmetics.

&#x200B;

The allergist also said **I probably didn't find the ingredient when I was tracking my reactions since the reaction can take 2-3 days to show up, and might not actually happen when I apply THAT product, but only when I apply something ELSE.** My mind was blown! This explained why my skin would break out in hives/redness/itching ""randomly"", and why it always seemed to be reacting to something. She also said I have dermatographic urticaria, which basically means my skin reacts with hives in reaction to pressure. This is why I can't wear fitted clothing (like socks, bras, pants, underwear, etc) for more than 12 hours without irritation.

I immediately went home and searched through my current skincare to see if I was using anything that had any of those ingredients. LOW AND BEHOLD: My beloved Stratia Liquid Gold!!!! I was so devastated. And confused...it's never caused problems. It's never burned or itched. In fact it's my go-to when my skin is in need of some extra TLC. I use it almost daily. It couldn't possibly be the source of problems, right? Maybe they mis-read my patch test? But I set it aside, and thought I'd try not using it for at least a month to see what would happen.

WELL.

It's a month later and I've completely avoided everything I'm allergic to and GUESS WHAT. Not only does my skin not burn or sting even a teeny bit when I apply my other skincare products, but my acne is better, my redness is almost gone, and my skin just feels so much less irritated! So while I'm sad to discontinue Stratia Liquid Gold, ultimately I think it's best for me to not use it. I'm also an expert at reading ingredient labels now, and it's actually really easy to avoid these, even though it's a common ingredient.

&#x200B;

# Who should see an allergist:

* Anyone who identifies as having 'sensitive' or 'reactive' skin.
* Anyone who has tried tracking skincare ingredients with no success
* Anyone who has a history of hives or sudden, extreme skin reactions.

If you fit any of the above, I really really recommend seeing an allergist if you can!",1570310071.0,0.98,141

[Anti-Aging] Ageing vs. Reality - Adjusting Expectations & Attitudes," Having missed the boat on the various anti-aging products at the appropriate time, I find myself almost 40 y.o. and confronting the consequences of poor life choices, specifically with sun protection. Fortunately most of my adult years were spent with minimal sun exposure, but I know I did some damage in my teens.

To compound matters, this past summer I ended up spending an excessive time in the sun without protection of any kind (I know, I know, sometimes shit happens). I did not emerge unscathed - I am convinced that from just a few months the pores on my forehead are noticeably larger and I am seeing some fine lines/beginning of wrinkles where just last year there were none. Yet another cautionary tale!

It is incredibly frustrating and hard to not feel like *""Is there even any point at this age?""* (Of course I know there greater point is for my general health, but to be clear I'm focused on appearance in this sense.)

**My question is this:** What kind of results can I expect to see with spf from this point onward? Given my age and the damage done, does ""it's never too late to start"" set unrealistic expectation for visible results? **In other words, is the damage irreparable, or is there still time for some significant damage control?**

To be fair, I am lucky to have otherwise exceptionally good skin for my age. I do want to start incorporating retinol so I will be religiously using spf in my daily routine regardless. In addition, I fully intend on getting botox when my budget allows, but I think it's important to have a realistic sense of what can and should be expected in terms of results.

I wanted to post this here because I appreciate a cross section of fanaticism and casual routines and believe all perspectives are valuable. Anyone with similar experience, advice or any recommendations all greatly appreciated.

[skin concerns] cleanser and moisturizer recommendations for dry comb skin,"Hi! New here and I’m having a hard time finding a face wash that doesn’t dry my skin out. Whenever I start using a new cleanser my face feels fine and hydrated, but after a few weeks it feels dry. I used to use the neutrogena cream cleanser (it has salicylic acid in it) a couple of months ago, and it made my skin soft, but it just didn’t seem like it was cleaning my face of all the dirt and oil. Then I switched to using African black soap, and that improved my dark spots a bit (not completely), but then it started drying out my skin. Now I’m using the aspexia soap targeted for dry skin (it has salicylic acid and glycolic acid) and it made my skin very soft the first few days but now it’s starting to dry. I’m guessing it’s bc of the two acids and I use it twice a day so maybe I should use this soap twice a week maybe? My face hasn’t broken out since using this soap however, or maybe I should incorporate hylaronic acid or something..

If this helps, I used to use the formula 10.0.6 thirst no more moisturizer which was pretty good in the summer, but now it’s getting cooler out and my skin can definitely tell so i switched to ponds moisturizing cream. I thought about trying the cerave sa cream but I’m not sure yet bc I really think it’s the cleanser I’m using and I need to switch maybe or use it less.

3. Rince face with water to remove all remaining product and pat with a towel
4. TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

"""[Acne] Persistent chin acne""","https://imgur.com/a/C1QzCpg

Just another girl looking for some skincare advice!!

I'm 30 yo with persistent chin acne that's usually deep and painful. I'm also very blackhead prone on my chin (see pic). 

My routine is pretty simple---

AM-
rinse with water,
first aid beauty acne pads,
Niacinamide,
belief aqua bomb,
spf

PM-
Clinique sonic foaming cleanser,
Tretinoin.05 (every other night for about three years),
Numis med urea

On no tret nights-
Clinique sonic foaming cleanser,
First aid beauty acne pads,
Hado labo premium gel

I have a boatload of other products and actives but I'm trying to simplify in hopes of clearing up the chin area. I have AA but I didn't notice much difference in the two weeks I used it. 

The FAB pads are new... I thought introducing Salicylic acid might be helpful. There have been some improvements but nothing too notable. Maybe I need a better cleanser or moisturizer with some actives in it??

Any assistance would be sooooo appreciated!!",1570287657.0,0.76,2

[Skin Concern] What the hell is wrong with my chest? Are these comedones? Well into 2nd course of Accutane.," 

Before the 1st round of Accutane, all these small bumps on my chest were quite inflamed and red. My derm said it was just acne. Anyway, by the end of the 7th month, the irritation / redness had gone but I still had all these bumps just on my chest. Derm didn't seem worried about these and took me off treatment. Anyway within a month or so the redness and inflammation of the pores came back. I told my derm who suggested it could be fungal acne so prescribed me creams/shampoos to calm it down. This did not really help much at all even after a few more months. Anyway, my normal acne on my face returned a few months later and so I started a 2nd course of Accutane. I'm now about 4 months in and while the redness has gone away again, I'm still covered in hundreds of white bumps on my chest? What the f&\*ck are they and why are they still here? I know that as soon as I come off it will become a mess again with red inflamation... :(

Thanks for the advice

I have also tried Differin (Adapalene) 3 months prior to starting Accutane, which didn't help. I cleanse and moisturise daily..

I'm looking for some routine help. I'm not sure my current routine is really working and trying something would at least make me feel proactive.

[Skin Concerns] Weird reaction after (mis) using tret and cerave. Help?,"(crossposted to r/tretinoin)

Hi Reddit! Apologies for what might be kind of a long post. I recently introduced tretinoin into my routine and I’m unsure if my reaction is normal and what I should do about it. 

So, first some context. I’ve been struggling with acne for several years, and recently I’ve been revamping my skincare routine. I started using Cerave products because they felt like a simple place to start, and had no issues until now. I have acne-prone, combination skin that gets very oily in my t-zone, but is pretty normal elsewhere on my face. No history of sensitivity or reaction to any products, at all. My routine is as follows:

AM:
—  Wash face with either cerave foaming or moisturizing cleanser based on how oily I feel. 
—  cerave AM moisturizer w/ spf
—  light concealer/any other makeup

PM: 
—  Shower, use either of the same 2 cleansers & physically exfoliate maybe once weekly
—  Cerave PM moisturizer
—  Lip balm as needed

Now for the real issue. I only started tretinoin 0.05% 4 days ago for acne, rough texture, scarring, the whole shebang. I wait till my face is dry after showering and apply it about an hour before moisturizer. Like an amateur, I started immediately using it every day. (I know, I know,this was stupid and I didn’t realize you weren’t supposed to until today. Oof.) 

The first day I was fine, but the second day I noticed some spots had begun to peel. From there everything went downhill. 

Peeling turned to flaking, large chunks of dead skin falling off my face. Around my smile lines, chin, nose, and along my cheek/brow bones turned a slight red, which is uncommon for me, an anemic slav. These spots are unsightly and maybe slightly itchy during the day, but at night they become painful. The past two days I’ve felt a slight burning when applying moisturizer and before it dries, but tonight it was worse, and lasted a little longer. Cleanser in the shower earlier also burned, but not enough to cause concern. 

I applied cerave ultra healing ointment to the areas after moisturizing, thinking I might just be extra dehydrated. It didn’t help, so my next thought was maybe it was the brand itself. Some searches on this sub told me that some people do not react well to cerave products. I tried my old moisturizer (Lush’s enzymion, which i’ve been using for the last couple months and had no issues with) on a small patch of the irritated skin and it didn’t burn at all; maybe a little discomfort a few minutes afterward, but that might just be the sore skin reacting. 

I’m skipping my tret for the night regardless, but I feel a little lost as to what I should do about this. My face feels so raw and dry at the same time, and this doesn’t feel like a normal reaction. Have I just been using too much too fast? Am I allergic? Or am I just responding poorly to cerave? Both? How should I proceed?


TL;dr: Started using tret and cerave recently, skin burning and flaky. Allergic or nothing special? How to proceed from here? Any insight is appreciated!!

[Acne] Worst Skin Ever -- is it Retinoid Purge or Should I Quit this Product?,"# Hi Team! I hope you all can help advise me because I'm starting to freak out!

The situation:

I have had clogged pores, closed comedones, and a fair amount of small red bumps and the ocassional cystic acne on my chin/ jawline for a long time. It's been annoying and troublesome, but usually I've just covered it with make up and moved on with my day.

Recently, I decided to try to do something about it. The routine I've been on for the past month is as follows.

AM:

* Wash face with Dr Bronner's and lukewarm water (this likely isn't the issue here, I've used this for a long time. Self experiments of months of this vs Cetaphil cleanser have left me confident this soap is fine for my skin type).
* Air dry
* Apply TO Niacinamide 10% and Zinc
* Apply Cereve AM Cream with SPF
* PM:
* Wash face with Dr Bronners
* Air Dry
* Apply TO Granactive 2% Emulsion
* Sometimes apply Cereve night cream, sometimes not.

My non-problem areas look glorious, but my chin is so broken out it's horrific. I have never had this much acne at the same time. It's honestly hard to go outside like this. So I'm wondering if this is the dreaded ""purge"", or if I should stop using this product altogether. It's been 4 weeks. To be fair, I do see all the areas that had large CCs now bursting forth into acne, but my question is -- will it ever stop? I have a ton of CCs, and if every single one of them turns into acne, I'm going to be suffering for a while. Not to mention all the acne leaves behind strong red marks, because I'm fair skinned, so there will be lingering evidence even after the pimples quit running the show on my chin.

Has anyone been through something similar? Any help is appreciated.",1570254997.0,1.0,13

It’s been two weeks and they’re “healed”, but there’s still a stubborn layer of dry skin, and a lot of lines as well. I was excited when I stopped picking, but I feel like I’ve hit a wall. Will they ever be smooth and normal again, and if you’ve gone through this process, what helped? I’ve been exfoliating them with scrubs at home, and I’ve tried bag balm which seems to help, and I have a sample of the Bite agave lip mask which I also like a lot, but it’s expensive.

[Routine help] I went ham on The Ordinary and now I have many small bottles and no direction,"Hi everyone! 

I'm picking up a new routine soon. Over the past couple of years my skin has gone from over-exfoliated, broken out and greasy, to perfect and clear while I was pregnant. Now, my skin is very oily, my jaw is constantly covered in CC's, my pores on my cheeks are huge and my skin is clogged up, dull and textured. I have tons of hyperpigmentation and dark spots, as well as fine lines. 

Currently, I rinse with water in the AM, use TO squalene oil. In the PM I wash with Cerave (in the green) then squalene oil. Every other day I use TO mandelic acid + HA. 

I made a huge order on TO and bought: 
Mandelic Acid + HA 
Squalene oil 
AHA 30% + BHA 2%
Alpha Arbutin 
Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%

I won't incorporate everything all at once, but right now I'm considering using everything besides the acids twice daily, then the AHA+BHA peel once weekly, and the mandelic acid every other day. I'm nervous about over-exfoliating my face again so I'm wondering if all of this is too much. I also ordered KOSE softymo speedy cleansing oil and canmake Mermaid SPF 50.

[Routine Help] Is this an okay way to start repairing my moisture barrier?,"My moisture barrier is SEVERELY damaged due to overexfoliation. It is past the tight / dry stage into very very bumpy and constantly stinging. 

I’m struggling with developing a simple routine to help heal it bc in the past I was so acne-prone (although I never fully identified the triggers) that I never even able to find a non-clogging moisturizer, but somehow was able to coast on just the glycerin in my acid toner until earlier this year. Given how scared I am of pretty much every potential ingredient like squalane, fatty alcohols, etc. due to my history of product breakouts and the fact that it takes them about 2 weeks to show up, I’m feeling pretty despondent.

I’m wondering, would this be an okay place to start? I did pick up some other products like Klairs supple preparation toner unscented, Stratia liquid gold, etc. but am anxious about trying them. My skin has never looked or felt like this before. :(

AM: Rinse with cool water, apply 5% glycerin in water with fingers. (I’ll make this fresh each time)

[Product Question] Peter Thomas Roth Retinol Fusion PM 1.5% vs. The Ordinary 1% Retinol in Squalane,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to get some advice here.

I'd been using the TO 1% retinol for a while. I recently switched to PTR's 1.5% one (with a price tag that's about 10x that of TO's 1% solution). It's definitely less oily than TO's and dries almost instantly. However, I'm wondering if it is as effective as the TO one?

I just assumed because it says 1.5% retinol, it was stronger than TO's. But back when I was using the TO one, I know after I got out of the shower for example, my skin around my jaw, etc. would feel super tight vs. with the PTR, sensations like that are less noticeable (I've been using PTR for about a week now). Not sure if sensations like that are the right way to judge effectiveness (besides seeing a difference in skin obviously).

I typically use Dr Bronner’s lip balm during the day, but I started using the Bite because I wanted something heavier at night. I have to sleep with a fan on so my lips do get kind of dried out, plus some of my medications mean I tend to be dehydrated in general more often than not.

What else should I try? Anything with cocoa butter is out because it gives me little blackheads around my lips. (Cocoa butter body products make me break out, too.) I’ve tried a sample of the Lanige(sp?) one in the little pink pot, and something about the smell/flavor gave me a headache, and I’ve been leery of seeing if it’s just that flavor or something in the base product.

So I've struggled with acne my whole life but the last 5-6 years have been the worst. I started using tret in June, followed all the guidance from you lovely people and was seeing results and coming to the end of the purge. My skin was looking so much better. 
But, my husband and I have decided to try and have a baby and since it's closely related to Accutane I figured it safest to stop using it a few weeks ago. I started working my old favorites back in now that I'm off tret. Unfortunately, my skin is breaking out again and I'm heart broken. Not only is it breaking out but it's very uneven.

I am positive it is this product because since I removed it from my routine my skin has been less dry and my barrier is improved. 

I know my barrier was damaged because whenever I’d apply anything to my face it would sting and burn like HELL.  Now the same exact products no longer burn or sting since I’ve removed the micellar water for over a month.

Unfortunately this is the only face soap I’ve found that doesn’t contain any ingredients I’m allergic to. I fear it’s just not strong enough to remove the makeup remover and it’s causing closed comedones.

[Misc] Big sized products?,"I've been trying to reduce plastic waste and skincare is one of the areas where it gets most difficult. 

I would love to find bigger sizes for regular use products such as moisturizers and cleansers that are suitable for acne-prone and sensitive skin. For instance, I've been using Sebamed Gel for over a year and a half now, but every tube is so tiny it lasts little even if I try to apply just a very small amount. 

The only brands I know at the moment with decent sizes are Cerave (unfortunately, the Lotion turns my face quite red and stings on application, and the Tub seems to worsen black heads...) and Acne.org (which I haven't tried).

[Product Question] Should I give up differin when 'going back to basics'?,"I'm at my wits end. I've been attempting to fix my constant breakouts for almost a year now with no luck.

Im considering going back to total basics to give my skin a chance to reset. Mineral oil OCM, Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser, Vanicream Lite Lotion, and Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk. Really basic products and no actives. That means no differin.

[Product Question] The Ordinary’s Vitamin C powder vs Drunk Elephant’s Vitamin C serum?,"[Product Advice] Drunk Elephant vs The Ordinary Vitamin C powder

The Ordinary Vitamin C powder vs Drunk Elephant

Usually I buy Drunk Elephant’s Vitamin C serum bc it seems like the closest dupe for Skinceuticals, but it’s so incredibly hot, that I’m concerned that if I order it off of Amazon, it will degrade during shipping. I also don’t like that the serum sometimes looks orange and is a bit on the pricey side. 

That’s when I discovered The Ordinary’s Vitamin C powder from the subreddit. I thought that might actually survive shipping, is very cheap, and will last me longer than the serum. It also won’t have pumpkin extract to turn it orange so I can’t tell when/if it’s oxidized. I’ve been told to mix the powder with The Ordinary’s Ferulic+Reseveratol (sp?) serum. 

My concern is that I’ve never used a powder, and I know that ph and vitamin C concentration are critical for efficacy, so I need to know exactly how much to mix. Also, is the powder form really much more stable? Esp when you have to open it all of the time vs the pump with Drunk Elephant? Also, how does it wear under makeup? How long do you wait to apply moisturizer? 

Thanks for any advice in advance. I’m trying to save money but also concerned with heat with shipping and efficacy.",1570216375.0,0.6,1

[Product question] Paula’s Choice 8% AHA Gel vs. Pixi Glow Peel Pads (20% glycolic acid),"Which of these would you recommend for use every other day?

I’m currently using the Pixi Glow Tonic every other morning and I’d like to increase the AHA concentration. Not sure if I should get the Paula’s Choice 8% AHA gel or the Pixi Glow Peel Pads (20% glycolic acid).

The Pixi pads seem a little harsh for use every other day. But the PC one means another layer of skincare and, unless the formula is cosmetically elegant (which, for example, the TO niacinamide isn’t), I’d rather avoid that... 

Has anyone tried both? What was your experience with either or both products?

My skin: No active acne (save for an occasional zit). No CCs (6-7 on my neck and a few tiiiiiiiny ones on my left cheekbone). Lots of PIE scarring. Sebaceous filaments. 1-2 blackheads.

[Routine help] Routine/treatment help for 35y/o acne prone skin,"I'm 35, and have oily breakout-prone skin that also often feels dull/dehydrated. I also have mild rosacea and an susceptible to hormonal acne along my jawline (including a recurring nodule) and cheeks. I'd classify my acne as mild, though I'm very susceptible to PIH, and I'd like my skincare regimen to help me reduce acne but also generally make my skin brighter and look more \~alive\~

I've tried various skincare treatments and regimen options throughout my 20s and 30s, but not much helped, and it honestly gets depressing. I have felt really defeated by the lack of progress I've made despite trying what feels like everything under the sun, which has led to me just going through periods where I just do absolutely nothing and give up

I'm currently (as of the past several months) in a period where I'm trying to make an effort, and here's what I'm trying:

&#x200B;

Current routine:

AM

Splash face with water

Nuxe Creme Fraiche de Beauté 48hr serum

Nuxe Creme Fraiche de Beauté 48hr hydrating creme

Suntegrity Natural Moisturizing Sunscreen/Primer

&#x200B;

PM

Cleanse: EITHER Drunk Elephant Beste Jelly OR Ole Henriksen The Clean Truth

Tone: Thayers Witch Hazel (alcohol free)

Serum: ONE OF EITHER Drunk Elephant TLC Framboos OR Drunk Elephant Retinol OR Perricone MD ThioPlex

Moisturize: Drunk Elephant Marula Oil AND ONE OF Consonant Ultra Hydrating Creme OR a moisturizer with niacinimide/zinc

Treatment: Cosrx acne patches as needed

1x a week: Tata Harper resurfacing mask

1x a week: Drunk Elephant Sukari Babyfacial

1x a week: random other mask (either Ole Henrisksen Power Peel or Origins Out of Trouble or a sheet mask)

&#x200B;

As you can see I'm experimenting with a lot of different products, but/and 95% of it doesn't actually seem to make any significant difference :/

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some products/treatments I've noticed does little/nothing/bad things for me:

Oil cleansing (which I've honestly tried in, like, every permutation under the sun)

Niacinimide (still using up current supply anyway)

Topical antibiotics (improves things somewhat but not entirely, and tends to make my skin dull)

Benzoyl peroxide

Retinol (have tried for months at a time before and never noticed much of a difference, trying again now anyway)

Vitamin C anything

Province Apothecary face balm (broke me out)

Biotin

&#x200B;

Products/treatments that DO seem to help:

Ceramides

Chitosan

Tata Harper resurfacing mask

Ole Henriksen Power Peel

Cosrx acne patches (lifesaver!)

&#x200B;

Any advice on things I should change, cut out, add? Or based on the limited number of things I've noticed DO seem to help, any recommendations on things I might add or do differently?

"[product question] Dry, acne-prone skin recs?","Hey everyone, I’d like some recommendations for good heavy duty moisturizers for acne-prone skin. I didn’t even realize that my skin was dry until maybe a year ago, because I was still in that “I get breakouts so I must be oily” mindset, but my skin definitely isn’t oily. The problem is, because I’m prone to clogged pores and breakouts, I have to be careful of which moisturizers I use. I feel like my skin has been drier than usual lately, probably because of the changing seasons. 

Current routine:
AM: Cleanse with grapeseed oil (I was using non-foaming Cetaphil, but found the oil works better and is more moisturizing.)
-light layer of clean & clear oil-free SA moisturizer 
- Eucerin daily protection SPF 30 

PM: Take off makeup and cleanse again with grapeseed oil
- recently got a trial size Pond’s Crema S for dry skin but probably won’t repurchase because I don’t love the smell, I’m thinking of trying Weleda Skinfood next. 
- sometimes I’ll put a layer of jojoba or grapeseed oil on with that 
- Pond’s Rejuveness lactic acid wrinkle cream 
- 10% BP spot treatment on any blemishes, I’ve found that this works really well for me and speeds up the healing process. 

I’m 25 and am on a bit of a budget, so anything in the drugstore or affordable price range would be nice! Thank you in advance!",1570205491.0,1.0,5

[Sun Care] i found the best sunscreen.,"I was a newbie to this sub a few months ago and like most people  had no ideia which sunscreen would be ideal for me.

After searching,i found out that european sunscreens are better than american ones,because american regulation does not let the UVA protection or PPD be high,UVA are the rays that causes premature aging,so i knew i had to buy an european one . SPF protects against UVB,most american sunscreens have PPD 8 or less.

I found an online store that delivered to USA and bought 2 sunscreens with PPd 42 and 46

Bioderma Max Lait SPF 50+PPD 42:Great sunscreen for dry skin,it's wonderful in the winter and it is good to replace your moisturizer.My skin is a little oily now so i will be putting this in my drawer. I used for 5 months.It does sting your eyes a little bit so be careful around that area.Very lighweight but it does leave a little shine.Absorbs very fast.It does not tan at all.

La roche Posay Shaka Fluid SPF 50+PPD 47.The best sunscreen that i ever used and i tested a lot.It does not sting your eyes,very lighweight and absorbs quickly,goes great under makeup,have been using for 2 months.I was getting wrinkles around my eyes and freckles and since i have been using no more freckles or new wrinkles under my eyes.It is a little bit more pricey than bioderma so you could buy both and use only around the eyes and bioderma around your face.

I always have to pop them because they get really inflamed and full of pus, and leave me feeling embarrassed all day. Pimple patches help drain them a bit faster but I wish I could stop them forming! Any advice out there, skincare community? 🙏🏼",1570185285.0,1.0,11
[B&A] 7 months of trying to use less products in my skincare regiment,https://i.imgur.com/ap4oZ1A.jpg,1570183889.0,0.96,18
[Personal] Why my routine isn't working? (Oily- Acne prone),"Hi, this is gonna be a LOOOONG post. But if anyone has the patient to read and help me understand what I didn't do correctly, I would really really really appreciate it:

So a bit of background: I used to NOT give shit or two about my skin: face wash -> lotion and that's it. But since I discover the new world of skincare, I have developed a very extensive skincare routine that I have done A LOT of research on. So my skin is very very very oily. I sweat like A LOT. On a typical hot day, I can feel a thick film of oil on my skin. Sometime they accumulated into these tiny pieces of oil that smells really nasty. I also often develop white heads and cyst acne that burn and leave scars/dark spots.

Here is my routine that I have been trying for the past 5 months - with steps added/subtracted:

1/ **Oil Cleanser**: ***DHC Deep oil cleanser***. I quite like it. So I think I am gonna stick with it for a while.

2/ **Face wash**: Now, I have a looong history of using different products: from Shiseido Perfect Whip, Biore anti-blackhead, The Bodyshop 365 Herb Days, The longest products I have used were ***La Roche Posay Effaclant Gel*** and ***Kiehl's Ultra Oil-free*** (I used them alternatively: Kiehl's when I feel my face is dirty and La Roche Posay when I feel like my skin is weak). I recently switch to ***Avene Cleanance Gel***. I don't like how it makes my skin feel tight afterward - so I'm 95% sure I ain't going back to that one.

3/ **Toner**: I was gifted this GIANT [**Kose Sekkisei Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/Kose-Sekkisei-lotion-500ml-Limited/dp/B01GUU8S2A) that I used as toner. It's actually quite good - I feel like it calmed my skin down after face wash. But ofc, ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" - so I attempted to use different products. My friends recommended this [Naruko Tea Tree Shine Control Toner](https://www.amazon.com/Naruko-Shine-Control-Blemish-Clear/dp/B00DLY96BG) as a toner for sensitive skin. I should have trusted my instinct when I read the ingredient and saw ""alcohol"" in it. I have to stop using it after two tries since it makes me feel like someone sticks needles on my skin.

4/ **Exfoliators/ acne treatments**: now this ALWAYS leaves puzzled: so I have tried to be consistent with my exfoliation routine: Monday: ***AHA (Neostrata 8)*** \- Tues: ***Paula's choice BHA 2% liquid*** \-Weds: NO (I use Rentinol-A cream) - Thursday: AHA - Friday: BHA - Weekends: NO (all at night). But I develop cyst acne and white head so often that almost every other day I have to use acne spot treatment: I have them all: [Kate Somerville Eradikate](https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Somerville-EradiKate-Acne-Treatment/dp/B001ZSBI8Y); [La Roche Posay Duo + spot treatment](https://www.amazon.com/Roche-Posay-Effaclar-Treatment-Benzoyl-Peroxide/dp/B004L8J15C), [Cosrx Acne Pimple patches](https://www.amazon.com/Cutelove-Pimple-Master-Hydrocolloid-Absorbing/dp/B07FSRPNPL/ref=sr_1_3?crid=JFAOB5H7R0DI&keywords=cosrx+acne+pimple+master+patch&qid=1570172540&s=beauty&sprefix=cosrx%2Cbeauty%2C405&sr=1-3-catcorr). I have to often combine 2 acne treatments together: spot cream and then Cosrx patch when I go to bed. So far, the only products that I like is Cosrx patches. Edit: I also wanna add: I use BHA/AHA on normal area and use spot treatments on affected areas. 

Like I said, I have acne so often that it's impossible for me to avoid exfoliation completely when I use spot treatment. I really don't find AHA or BHA helps me with cyst or white heads. So I apply AHA/BHA on normal areas - and only use spot treatments on the effected spots.

5/ **HA/B5 serum**: I really like this step. After exfoliation, this helped my skin like a lot. I apply [***Timeless Skin Care Hyaluronic Acid Serum***](https://www.amazon.com/Original-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serum-100/dp/B01C1UJVAG/ref=pd_sbs_194_t_1/134-7822135-0643143?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B01C1UJVAG&pd_rd_r=01cd78cb-9762-4b5d-80b2-2ea0f7d7f7ef&pd_rd_w=iyLzX&pd_rd_wg=CYYbm&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=GKHGPT3YGXE2ZAZWV61H&refRID=GKHGPT3YGXE2ZAZWV61H) and then spray mineral water on top of it. I don't think I could ever quit this step. I do this both day and nights every single day.

6/ **Other serums**: so far, I'm using two products at nights: **The Ordinary's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%** and [***Cosrx's Centella Blemish Ampule***](https://www.amazon.com/COSRX-Centella-Blemish-Ampule-20ml/dp/B06XHFSZ79) ( I just started using this couple days ago). I don't know why but I don't like my skin feel HOT after using Ordinary's Nia. I'm not sure if this supposed to feel normal or not. But I don't use Nia in the morning because of this uncomfortability.  In the morning I use [***Maelove Glow Maker Serum***](https://maelove.com/products/the-glow-maker) \- given the affordable price of this Vitamin C serum, I am quite content with it.

**7. Moisturizer:** I have used ***Neustrogena's Hydro boost gel*** for oil skin for 2 years. So far I like it - after using Nia, I feel like it helped reduce the hotness of my skin. But I wanna trying different ingredient - so I'm waiting for 2 boxes of ***Nature Republic's Aloe Vera*** gel to try on.

**8. Face/lips mask**: I am using [**Laneige water sleeping mask**](https://www.allure.com/review/laneige-water-sleeping-mask-review) and [***Laneige's lip mask (berry)***](https://www.sephora.com/product/lip-sleeping-mask-P420652) as a final step at night. The water sleeping mask feel...okay. But the lip mask feel like I just rubbed some scented lard on my lips.

**9. Retinol:** I use ***Retinol-A cream***. I think it's does tremendously for my skin. However, there are some bumpy spots on my skin that I CANNOT get rid of (I will talk about this later...)

**10. Other products in the morning:** I used [***La Roche Posay's mattifying moisz***](https://www.laroche-posay.us/face-and-body-skin-care/face-products/face-moisturizer/effaclar-mat-mattifying-moisturizer-3337872413025.html) around my T-zone area to control the oil breakout. It's not completely reduce the oil breakout - but I think it's the best product that I have bought. **Sunscreen:**  I am currently using [***Anessa SPF50 PA++++***](https://www.amazon.com/Shiseido-Anessa-Perfect-Sunscreen-Booster/dp/B01MYESM2H) for two reasons: my mom bought 5 bottles on her recent trip to Japan and the ""PA++++"" label of it. I think it's fine.

&#x200B;

Now that's all the detail of my skincare routine (if you able to read all of that - I salute you!). So far: I think there are some significant change in my skin. My skin feel less oily and rough. The complex is better (but not much). I really believe that I have followed quite carefully all of skincare tutorials and blogs I could find. But I really don't think it should work the way I expected:

\- I [still have a lot of bumps on my skin](https://imgur.com/a/AloWNLf) \- especially on my cheeks, forehead and chin's area. I don't know if it's actually **fungal acne** or not. But I am considering of purchasing Nizoral Shampoo as a treatment.

\- There are still after-acne dark spots on my skins. What products should I use?

\- Am I correct to say that my skin is quite **inflammatory?** What additional products do you think I could add and what products should I stop using immediately.

&#x200B;

[Humor] DE's D-Bronzi isn't sunscreen....,"I was at Sephora the other day and as usual was window shopping expensive brands, when of course I drop by the Drunk Elephant shelf. I see the try-me products set out, and knew I had at least tried most of them...oh! except for this new ""Sunshine Drops"" sunscreen they came out with! Awesome!

My glasses were off since I was testing products, and nowhere did I read any variation of the word ""Bronze"" on the tube. I squeeze some out so I can apply it to my face, as I could have used some touch up on my sunscreen anyway. I estimate based on the consistency that my usual dime-sized glop would do.

I spread it as evenly as possible over my face. It feels so silky and fluid! Very light for a sunscreen. A faint smell of...chocolate? in there too.

So, I suddenly get a text and have to run. I barely had time to check my face in the mirror for how the sunscreen looked upon application, but I knew for sure it felt (and even smelled) great.

I still decided to quickly make a purchase before heading out, as the line wasn't too long.

I go and stand in line, and I just see...glances.

Not the usual glances because I'm a generic looking guy inside Sephora shopping alone. It's different. One person even snickered a bit when her friend gestured her to turn around and look.

I couldn't imagine what was so funny about me being there? Was it what I was buying? No clue. I just skirt it off as nonsense and finally am able to get to the SA on register. Upon looking up at me I see that she has to force down a giggle. ""Even her?"" I thought. FFS she's on the job and still finds...whatever it is...amusing enough to break character.

After my purchase is done she wishes me a good day with a  more professional smile, but I can hear giggling as I turn around and depart. The SA upfront bids me thank you with a more concealed grin. Definitely I was happy to leave such a bizarre experience shopping at Sephora, without a clue as to what was attracting such humorous attention.

I get to my car and unlock it, and as usual set my rear-view mirror before starting my car, and yea. I think I laughed harder than anyone else in the store. The best part was my snow-white ears on the periphery of my nutella face.

tl;dr: read products carefully before trying them on in public, otherwise you could end up looking like a full-body spray tan applied to the face only.",1570174583.0,0.83,7

[Routine Help] I need a new skincare routine as my skin care needs have changed from getting older.,"Skincare noob here! I (35F) have been using solely Aveda skincare lines for about 15 years. A cream cleanser, a light toner and a moisturizer. I’ve recently been capping it off with an ayurvedic oil. They have worked wonderfully but I am starting to get pronounced laugh lines and my skin has become dull and I long for luster! 

I have moderately dry skin and get about one zit every week before my period. They used go away and heal rather quickly but they are staying for longer and stay pretty red for a while. 

I only want to use natural products and I am a fan of Ayurvedic products. One of my biggest challenges is that I live in the desert and finding a light day moisturizer that doesn’t make me sweat through my makeup is almost impossible. 

I am just now looking for products and natural ingredients to reduce fine lines. But I have no clue where to begin!! 

Here is what I am considering: 

•Micellar water and a cleansing Ayurvedic oil as opposed to a cleanser. 
•Serum with Vitamin C 
•Day and night moisturizers with antioxidants 
•Ayurvedic skin oil for my dosha

[Misc] Thoughts and insights into the acid mantle health of the skin along with a general explanation for anyone who has tried everything and a possible informative post?,"Biochemist here who suffered from acne and trying to explain things without sounding like a textbook. Legit had to get a degree to fix my skin  🤦‍♀️ Bear with me-

[personal] If I don’t keep up using good surfactants (level of “lifting” a soap does to foreign things on your face) and the health of my acid mantle my face looks like puberty hit me again due to high abundance of gram negative bacteria in my body (genetics+environmental factors) also diagnosed by a dermatologist. 

[observations] 90% of the posts here about acne (guess but I’ve been on here 2 years) are described and with photos have poor acid mantle health ie. over-stripped oils, high irritation from products, not enough water moisture. overly aggressive products, or using aggressive products, etc.  without addressing the acid mantle first. (This was observed from products used and side effects) Think of the acid mantle as a barrier that keeps out foreign bacteria,fungi, etc. that causes acne. The problem with most skincare is balancing cleansing which removes the bacteria (yay) but also a portion or all of the acid mantle depending on the strength of the surfactant. This means not all soaps will work for you by either: not removing the bacteria or removing too much of the acid mantle. 

👇
[Key takeaway] Without addressing the acid mantle health first and using aggressive treatments you are further “breaking down the barrier” for either more things to get into your skin or for the current things in your skin to go deeper in your skin (common in gram negative bacteria-they can move! Learned that the hard way Ew)
👆

If anyone can put together an extensive post about this that would be awesome!!!!! I see the community would benefit greatly from it. 


Tdlr: you need to evaluate and treat the skin (and acid mantle) like a tiny precious baby or you break skin barriers that protect you from acne/worsening acne before using actives or topical treatments.

[Routine Help] Does anyone use multiple acids?,"I have combination skin with some sunspots and uneven skin tone. Fortunately, I have no acne, and only get a blemish around ""that"" time of the month. I'm not particularly sensitive to any one ingredient that I've used so far, and have used SA in an unsuccessful attempt to control oiliness for probably 20+ years. Essentially, I'm wondering if it's harmful to use AHAs (glycolic and lactic) and BHAs on an alternating or rotating basis in order to address the issues with unevenness and dark spots, while at the same time, still using SA to prevent/treat a break out. Specifically, in lower percentages, and never at the same time. Would you even see any benefit from 1-2x/week usage of AHAs? The internet is fairly conflicting on this, focusing mainly on the dangers of using them all together at one time. 

Any experience with trying this or advice would be much appreciated!",1570159451.0,1.0,3

So, with these new products, could I layer them all at once and do something along the lines of:

1. Cleanser

2. Cosrx Pimple Patch

3. Cosrx Aloe Vera Moisturizer 

4. Cosrx Overnight Honey Facial

5. Cosrx 96 Snail Mucin

"[Product Question] Can anyone recommend a toner similar to this one, but without the salicylic acid?

However, I recently damaged my moisture barrier badly and cannot use this product while my skin is healing due to the salicylic acid it contains, and my skin is really feeling its absence. (I tried to reintroduce it, and that was a horrible mistake - painful bumps and stinging skin all over the damaged area)

Active: Salicylic Acid 2%

Inactive: Water (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol (hydration), Pentylene Glycol (hydration), Polysorbate 20 (stabilizer), Butylene Glycol (hydration), Glycerin (skin replenishing), Sodium Hyaluronate (hydration/skin replenishing), Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate (skin-soothing), Allantoin (skin-soothing), Panthenol (hydration), PEG/PPG-17/6 Copolymer (texture-enhancing), Methyl Gluceth-20 (hydration), Glycereth-26 (texture-enhancing), Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (hydration), Sodium Hydroxide (pH adjuster), Tetrasodium EDTA (stabilizer), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer).

ETA: Oddly, while I'm assuming glycerin and sodium hyaluronate in this product are among the ones helping me, glycerin and HA in fairly simple formulations alone both broke me out (Heritage glycerin + rosewater spray and Cosmedica hyaluronic acid serum (water + HA + preservative)).",1570156925.0,1.0,5

Two pimples came out of the same pore and I think that’s what caused it. And by two pimples I mean once the first one was gone. Maybe a week later another appeared.

It is drying but i find its no where near as bad as other acne treatments. Like benzoyl peroxide or topical prescriptions.

[Routine Help] I have oily skin and I can't figure out a skincare routine.,"I'm 22, and I've had oily skin since I was about 13 or 14. I've always had really bad blackheads and enlarged pores on/around my nose, and on my upper cheeks. When I was younger, I used Neutrogena oily face wash and Clearasil rapid action face wash to clear up my ""puberty acne"", but as I got older, it became more of a hormonal acne outbreak about once a month or so, so I wouldn't consider myself ""Acne-prone"", besides blackheads.

I've tried talking to the reps at Ulta and Sephora, and I was recommended the \[Clinique oily skin routine\]([https://www.ulta.com/3-step-introduction-kit-oilier-skin-type-3?productId=xlsImpprod10792051&sku=2256864&\_requestid=5884418](https://www.ulta.com/3-step-introduction-kit-oilier-skin-type-3?productId=xlsImpprod10792051&sku=2256864&_requestid=5884418)), and while it seemed to work ok, I did notice that after I dried off from my showers, my face felt very tight, and the toner would burn/itch. I then decided to try the \[Mario Badescu Oily skin routine\]([https://www.ulta.com/combooily-regimen-kit?productId=xlsImpprod6200817](https://www.ulta.com/combooily-regimen-kit?productId=xlsImpprod6200817)), and I hated it. the face wash felt like I had slathered butter all over my face and couldnt wash it off, the toner burned, and the moisturizer felt like it never really soaked in.

I'm now wondering if i'm even treating the right skin type. I am pretty confident that I have oily skin, because my face gets a visible sheen to it shortly after I wash it, to the point I've had a coworker blot ""sweat"" off of my forehead (which was oil), and all the foundations I try will wipe off after about two hours, regardless of brand, primer, setting powder, etc. Late in the evening, my face gets so oily that it makes my eyes burn.

That being said, there have been times where when I would apply setting powder, and my makeup would get kind of scaly around my nose and upper lip. I'm not sure if that was because of a foundation I was trying, or a facewash.

I am very frustrated at this point, and am currently at the point where I don't even bother wearing makeup because I know it'll just separate and wipe off after a couple hours. My face feels constantly sticky and I don't know what to try anymore :(",1570129675.0,0.64,9

"[Routine Help] Tips for absolute beginner, female student, unsure of what skin type I have"," 

Hey folks

I'm a 25 year old gal, and I've been a bit interested in skin care routine lately, which is weird since I've never really been. But maybe you could give me some tips? Sorry if the post is long.

First off, I'm a student, and I've been trying to find any makeup or cream that is super cheap, but I also try to be weary when it doesn't ""look"" like good quality. But I've no read way of telling. But I'm willing to stretch the budget a bit, I'll try to not be too greedy.

Second, I don't have that many problems with my skin tbh. No real acne anymore (thank god), except for the usual thing around my nose and under my lower lip, on my chin. Very rarely anywhere else. I've heard though that you shouldn't really mess with those things too much, because they're not real blackheads, and your skin might want them there, but I don't know. I think if I understand what oily skin is, my oily areas are my nose and my forehead mostly.

One thing that's been bothering me a bit for quite some time is that whenever I get my face wet (showering, throwing water in my face in the morning, swimming, w/e), my face gets, or at least feels super super dry, like a desert.

One more note, although I'm in a warm climate for two more months (exchange) I live up in Scandinavia, so it's colder than many other places in the world, dry air, winter air. There is pollution since I live in the city, but not nearly as bad as where I am right now (South-East Asia).

I've used a thick, not very fancy cream for moisturizing when my face gets dry from the chemist where I live, but I think I want something a little lighter. I like the consistency of the cream, and not really 'watery' stuff (forgive me, I barely know what essence, sprays, serums or anything means or does). Also good smell is nice, but I know good smell can mean a lot of things. I know I like the Sensai cellular performance cream smell at least (didn't buy it, a friend gave me a tiny sample jar. It looks real expensice).

Huge bonus, even preferred, if products are not tested on animals (so I've stayed away from stuff like Maybelline, L'oréal, the big ones). DIY is also welcome (slightly related, I started waxing using sugar, and I really prefer it to wax strips now)

Thanks folks!",1570118816.0,0.71,11

[Routine Help] The amount of tretinoin/clindamycin gel that my derm prescribed to me seems almost ridiculously high. Am I using way too little?,"I was prescribed Biacna gel (0.025% tretinoin + 1.2% clindamycin phosphate) by my GP just over 7 weeks ago, and a few weeks after that I saw the dermatologist I was referred to. As I go to school in a different country, she said to keep doing what I was doing and prescribed me ""a year's supply"" of Biacna so that I could use it throughout university without needing to get another prescription. I agreed and took the prescription for 12 60g tubes and picked up 3 of them, so I now have 4 total. 

However, I've been using the very first tube I was prescribed for nearly 2 months now, and I don't think I'm even a quarter of the way through it. In order to go through one 60g tube in a month like the derm said, I would have to use 2g a day, and while I'm not able to measure that out, I think it would be literally about 4x more than I'm currently using, and I'm pretty sure I'm already using more than the usual 'pea sized amount'.

So my question is – should I be using more? I've had pretty much no irritation from it but I'm more concerned about using too much antibiotic + promoting resistance. My purge is pretty much done and my skin is very nearly flat, but now I have a TON of erythema so it pretty much still looks like I have acne. I'll put my routine below and I would appreciate any help?

[Misc] How do you know if your Aesthetician is falsly reccomending treatments?,"Hi SCA! 

I recently won a free chemical peel from a local aesthetician's IG page. The aesthetician herself was amazing and provided me with really good information on how a peel works and the benefits of such a peel. As our session was starting to wrap up, I asked her how frequently a peel should be done etc. At that point, she looked at my skin and told me given the amount of work that has to be done, she would recommend I purchase a 6 peel package we will use in a 6 week period and once those 6 sessions are completed we can re-evaluate. 

Prior to going to an aesthetician, I used to use only drugstore products recommended by this community. She recommended that I try some of the products she sells because they have better quality ingredients but are much more expensive than my normal routine.

While I do have some light acne scars and I suffer from hormonal acne, I wasn't sure whether to trust her opinion as she obviously has a financial gain if I do go with her recommendation. How do you determine if your aesthetician is making recommendations that are correct for your skins or if they're just looking to make extra money off your treatments? 

Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that 99% of aestheticians are honest people, but I'm just trying to make sure I don't get stuck with that 1% that may take advantage. I apologize if my question may sound like I'm accusing my aesthetician, it's not that at all, just trying to do my due diligence and learn about red flags to look for.",1570116073.0,0.67,7

[anti-aging] I want glowing skin at 42!,"42f. Have always managed to look 10-12 years less than my actual age, which is great, but I’m starting to see small signs of aging. I’ve never had a skincare routine tbh. Soap and water until soap started making me break out. Dermatologist recommended cetaphil face wash, neutrogena make up. I do not put anything on my face other than those things and never have. Not that I don’t want to, but a lot of things cause me to break out so I’m just afraid to use them. I have to use ALL free and clear detergents/dryer sheets etc. Anything scented makes me break out.

Now that I’m starting to see signs of aging - mostly under eye/around eyes, maybe 1 or 2 fine lines elsewhere - nothing major - I want to get into an aging skin care routine that rehydrates and, I don’t know, I just want glowing skin! I’ve never used a lot of makeup. Just neutrogena foundation and Mineral powder, eye liner, chapstick. I very much like to look natural and not overdone, that’s why I want to focus on my skin having a hydrated glow. 

I never really had a huge female influence growing up, just my grandma who swore by soap and water and nothing added. I don’t have many female friends to confer with on this, as the ones I do have just aren’t into skin products, so I plead ignorance.

[Routine Help] Flaky skin - Please Help!!,"Hello! Thank you for reading this post. I really need some help with my face right now. I'm new to skincare, so please excuse my lack of terminology! Here's my background:


I went for a facial on Monday and left with my face glowing! I have combination skin, but in my T-Zone it can be pretty dry. I also have rosacea so the esthetician recommended the Vitamin C facial. It worked wonders and for once my face was even and smooth! She recommended 3 products that she used during the facial...


Image Skincare Vita C Hydrating Cleanser ($30)
Image Skincare Vita C Serum ($68)
Image Skincare Prevention + Daily Tinted Moisturizer with SPF ($40)


I bought the cleanser and the moisturizer, but said that I would come back for the serum if I had good results with the other products. The products are non-refundable and I was worried the serum would make me break out. I had previously tried the Cera Ve products and broke out like crazy so I'm a little scared of hyaluronic acid.


The first day I used the cleanser at night with my old moisturizer (First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream). I loved the cleanser! It felt great and my skin looked more even. The next morning I used the cleanser again with the tinted moisturizer. I liked how the tinted moisturizer felt, BUT it made me look slightly orange. I asked my coworkers and they also thought I looked unnaturally tan so I will not be using that again! $40 out the window! My FAB moisturizer is almost gone and I honestly don't like it that much because my face turns red after using it. So I decided to go back to the spa to buy the Image Skincare Prevention + Hydrating Daily Moisturizer with SPF. That night I went home and I used the cleanser followed by the moisturizer. The moisturizer felt okay, but I was hoping it would be a little lighter. The next morning I woke up to flaky skin, which is pretty normal for me and it usually washes off. After using the cleanser and moisturizer after my shower, however, I noticed that I had soooo many flakes that would not come off. I ended up using a tweezer to pick off most of the flakes but I was not happy. I thought maybe it was a fluke, so I washed my face and moisturized at night.... same thing with the flakes.


This morning, I attempted to use my cleanser in the shower with my Clarisonic in hopes that it would brush away the flakes. As I'm putting my moisturizer on I noticed that my hands were covered in flakes and my face still looked terrible! It looks so bad that I took a sick day from work.


Based on this, I'm thinking the moisturizer is not a good fit for me! I'm pretty upset because that's another $40 out the window. What do you guys think I should do? I can switch back to my First Aid Beauty ultra repair cream for now but I'm almost out and it seems to irritate my face. Also what can I do to get rid of these flakes?? I'm open to any advice!

[misc] Pixi glow 20% glycolic acid pads,"So i generally have oily and acne prone skin. I was able to get rid of 90% of my acne issues and oiliness when i stopped eating all junk food/ sugary food, caffeine,  and margaritas lol. The oiliness pretty much stopped and my break outs are minimal. 

My issue is the dark spots left behind. I was using the ordinarys peeling solution (twice a week) and their glycolic acid toner (daily). I have been consistently for the last couple of months. In the past i had used them to clear out dark spots pretty quickly. It just hasn’t been working for me this go round. I added vitamin c serum,  the ordinarys  niacinamide , and their lactic acid for 2 months. No changes to my spots.  I also use super goop sunscreen. 

I threw in their azelaic suspension a week ago. I noticed yesterday that i was starting to get the fine pumps on my face again. So on a whim i went to target and got the Pixi glow pads. I used them last night. 

I shit you not, this morning all of those fine bumps are gone. And my dark spots already look a little faded. I’m not a big person to say i see results easily. But i really do. I will be coming back to update you guys in about a month of the results. Just wanted to help someone if i can.",1570103489.0,0.97,17

[skin concerns] I need help with on some good products for my dehydrated skin.,"I think my skin is dehydrated, as it’s very oily and when I wear makeup it won’t cling to a lot of areas which I once thought was because I was to oily, but now I think it’s because I have dry patches. My skin never feels baby smooth, it feels rough, textured. 
Is it possible my skin cell turnover is not fast enough hence why the moisturisers I am using aren’t effective ? Like they are just sitting on the top of my skin? 
I used epiduo forte ( differin gel ) but had to stop as it was bleaching all my clothes. I felt like it made a lot of difference though, my skin was starting to feel smooth. 
I got a prescription for differin not epiduo forte so I will be using that soon, but can anyone give me some help on some good moisturisers or has anyone else had this problem.

Currently using 

- the ordinary Hylaronic acid 
- drunk elephant b hydra intensive hydrating gel 
-cearve facial moisturising lotion 
- cearve moisturising cream in the tub.

[Skin Concern] Possibly introducing Stridex Pads to my routine to take care of closed comedones?,"I'm still kind of new to my routine (about 5 ish months in?) which is:

Am- clease with Vanicream cleanser then moisturize with Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion.

Pm- cleanse with Vanicream cleanser then Amara beauty vitamin C serum w. Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E then moisturize with Clinique lotion.

Pretty simple but I've noticed that I keep getting closed comedones/pimples on my forehead as well as right between my eyebrows. It's always been an issue but got a bit better when I'd changed from a sephora face wash to the Vani cream. I've seen that a few people have been recommending stridex (as well as Differin) but I'm not sure if I should be skipping the serum the days that I do the wipes or another product?

"[Misc] As silly as it sounds, I have incorporated hydration (drinking water) into my evening routine","I don't always get enough water, and my lips get chapped when I haven't had enough. This at least gives me a little bit of hydration. I have a small water bottle that I fill it before I do my evening routine. I drink half the bottle at step 3 and the other half at step 5.

1. Wash face in shower with Purpose Face Wash
2. Stridex pad
3. Sip 8 oz of water while waiting a couple minutes for face to dry
4. TO ""Buffet"" Serum
5. Sip another 8 oz of water while waiting for serum to absorb
6. Moisturize with Cetaphil Restoraderm (it is the only thing that keeps my eczema under control)
7. Spot treat any blemishes with Clean and Clear Advantage Spot Treatment

I've just switched to the TO serum, as I was previously using a generic Vitamin C serum that I bought on amazon (which didn't really impress me). It's the first product that I've purchased from The Ordinary, and I'm hoping it will work out for me.

[Anti-Aging] What are the risks of using 15 times more than the recommended tretinoin amount - I did it,"To anyone on here with a really knowledgable background...

Is  the risk incredible irritation, peeling, dryness, etc., or is it  paradoxical effects such as those seen when microneedling too often aka  destruction of collagen and in the case of tret, accelerated aging?

Just  wondering because something has f\*\*\*ed my skin up, but not sure if it  is vitamin c serum (which I have read at least one account of it doing  it to a person), niacinamide (surely not), or the fact that I used 15  pea sized amounts at least on my face for about 6 months.

I  was actually really careful, and started off the right way with .25%  retinol for a couple of months, then 1% for a couple more months, then  Differin for a 1 or 2; and by this stage I am starting to slather on  with no ill effects (I had one instance of peeling when I first started  using retinol after the first couple of uses, and then again after the  first few times after moving up to 1%, and then nothing after that),  then moved up to .25% tret, progressively moving up to .5%, then 1% with  still no further peeling with any despite slathering 15 pea sized  amounts until maybe the first few days into 1% where I might have had a  very minor peeling.

The peeling of course didn't appear to be anything too sinister, just a healthy sloughing off of the top layer.

In  recent months I have gone off it for a month and then restarted using  it really conservatively with 1 pea sized amount mixed with about 4  times as much moisturiser but still feel pretty confident that my skin  is still going downhill. It's hard to say though 100% because I  developed so many little fine lines from the unsuccessful episode that  it's hard to notice them all at once and I'm unsure if ""new"" ones are  just ones that I just didn't initially notice because there was so much  going on to focus on, but I am pretty sure it keeps getting worse (85%).

Also,  I always applied Hada Labo lotion (toner-like product), the milk  (lotion-like product) and Cerave in the tub all in large amounts after  washing my face before applying the tret several hours later which I was  led to believe buffered the affects of it, and was maybe why I felt I  was having no ""reaction"" to it in the sense of irritation, etc.

Not  here for a lecture, and no, my moisture barrier is not compromised, my  skin is more hydrated than ever before, I know what a compromised  moisture barrier is, I've been there before, I'm the furthest thing from  that right now. I sleep with a thick layer of Aquaphor every night and  my skin is the furthest thing from dry.

Just  wondering if anyone with a good amount of knowledge (like someone with  any professional experience within the field) would know if using  retinoids in the fashion I have would result in paradoxical affects or  whether I am just one of the outliers who just gets accelerated skin  aging and other issues from using it, because they are out there, as I  am starting to think that I am one, and stopping using altogether would  be the best thing for me; or vitamin c is the culprit.

Thanks!

TLDR:  Is my skin aging from using way too much retinoid, being an atypical  responder who is just one of the outliers that gets paradoxical results,  or is it even vitamin c?

PS:  Being a guy with facial hairs makes it f\*\*\*ken impossible to use 1 pea  sized amount because it all just goes straight onto the hair first and  foremost and that's pretty much what got me into the practice of using  massive amounts, and I was using cheap stuff from India (ADC) which I  thought might have been even more watered down than the label suggested  the potency was due to getting no response from it when I did on  retinol, so don't be super critical.

I would have stopped doing it for sure if I had have just had some sign of redness or irritation!

[Skin Concerns] My doctor rejected my request for referral to a dermatologist,"I’m am at a loss. In one week my skin has made a 180 on me and I have no idea what is wrong.

When I take a shower my body gets covered in red patches and small itchy bumps on my forearm and hips. My face is even redder and itchy.

Pictures of my skin (possibly NSFW): https://imgur.com/a/71VFKXQ 

I went to my doctor but she didn’t think I needed to go see a dermatologist because “they only deal with diseases in the skin and you don’t have that + there’s a waiting list for at least 6 months”. She told me it looked like perioral dermatitis and gave me a prescription for some antibiotic cream (which I can’t even pick up because she forgot to send the prescription to the pharmacy!!).

I went to the pharmacy and asked them for help but they were kind of clueless about which products I should buy.

[Skin Concerns] small tiny bumps all over face!,"my skin hasn’t ever been really BAD, and i’m not one to really have much acne. in-fact, my face was almost clear a couple weeks ago, other than my previous dark scarring on my cheeks. even so, recently i’ve been growing bumps all over my face. I would post a picture but i’m not sure how. the bumps are really small but pronounced, and are on my cheeks and chin mainly. some even grew around my mouth, the inner creases outside the sides of my nose and over my lip? which is concerning because i NEVER get acne there. there’s also a lot around the cheek area next to both sides of my nose. it’s flesh colored so it wont be seen unless you put it over bad lighting or come close to my face. The only new products I’ve included in my skincare routine has been thayers witch hazel (aloe version) and the clindamycin topical gel my doctor gave me. i’ve been thinking maybe its the witch hazel?  because i get a slight burning sensation and i think it caused the irritation bumps (what i think they are) around the cheek area next to my nose. for the rest of my face, i’m not too sure what the root of the problem is :( maybe a bad reaction from the clindamycin?

[Review] The 10 sunscreens I've tried in my HG search! In depth reviews + swatches,"**TL;DR HG:** Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun SPF 50+ PA++++

[The gang's all here. All ten sunscreens lined up.](https://imgur.com/i1kIqUr)

I've tested ten sunscreens over the last few months in the search for my HG. I've listed rough $/mL, filters, and common ingredients that are frequently avoided or sought after for each sunscreen. I also included swatch pictures at the end of this post. I'm located in the US and bought all of these either from CVS, Target, Amazon, or YesStyle. Prices may vary from what's listed depending on where you shop. Sorry this post is so massive!

I highly recommend checking out SkinCarisma, CosDNA, and INCIdecoder for products you're interested in. They have way more info than I can provide about the purpose/effect of each ingredient. There are also potential allergens/goodies/acne triggers that I haven't listed, so always check the full ingredient lists!

**Skin type:** dry (extra dry and flakey from 0.02% tret), papule/pustule prone, very pale with redness and PIE.  
**My sunscreen needs:** no white cast, finish dewy or matte, keep my redness down, be affordable, no eye irritation    
**Current routine:** AM: rinse with water, thin layer LRP Cicplast Baume B5, Purito Centella Unscented. PM: Albolene, LRP Toleraine Hydrating Gentle Cleanser, LRP Cicaplast, Curology (~every other night, wait till face is dry), Vaseline  

---

**Neutrogena Ultra-Sheer Liquid SPF 70**

* $9-13 for 1.4 oz/40 mL ($0.23-0.33/mL)
* Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate, Octocrylene, Oxybenzone
* Contains fragrance, silicone, vit C, vit A (retinyl palmitate)
* I really liked the liquid texture of this one, it felt very easy to apply the full recommended amount. I enjoyed the way my skin felt to the touch after applying, very smooth and soft thanks to silicones. However, shortly after applying I felt like my face was excessively warm and saw that my whole face was bright red. Had a somewhat oily/greasy finish. Fragrance is unnoticeable but might have broken me out. Ran into my eyes and stung like the dickens. Also not sure why it has vitamin A, don't retinoids/retinols degrade in sunlight?

**Neutrogena SheerZinc**

* $9 for 2 oz/59 mL ($0.15/mL)
* Filter: Zinc oxide
* Contains silicone, glycerin, Vit E
* Took a lot of rubbing in to remove extreme white cast, and then needed ~20-30 minutes to soak in. Don't you dare try rubbing it in after it dries, it will snow. The white cast did go away eventually on my pale skin but it was thick, hard to rub in and left me looking oily. Didn't burn my eyes but definitely built up in my eyelid creases. Pilled, really clung to skin flakes. The excessive rubbing in felt kind of irritating but at least afterwards it felt cool and calming on my face.

**Supergoop Unseen SPF 40**

* $32 for 1.7 oz/50 mL ($0.64/mL)
* Filters: Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octinoxate, Octisalate
* Contains silicone, shea butter, vit E, jojoba esters
* Very cosmetically elegant, went on clear and dried matte. Actually was a little too drying, even with the shea butter which was surprising. No sunscreen smell, translucent with a slight yellow tint. Left skin feeling silky smooth, kept wanting to touch my face after application. Unfortunately made my face red and hot. Now suspicious of avobenzone, think it might be the irritant. Stung my eyes, so had to avoid the eye area and be more careful with sunglass use. Also this one is too pricey for me, I was just desperate to know cosmetically elegant sunscreens were possible.

**Australian Gold Botanical Sunscreen Tinted Face Mineral Lotion SPF 50**

* $9-14 for 3 oz/89 mL ($0.10-0.16/mL)
* Filters: Titanium Dioxide, Zinc Oxide
* Contains silicone, shea butter, glycerin, squalane
* The tint was too dark for my very pale face and after a couple hours it really exacerbated my dry/flakey spots. I don't like wearing makeup and felt like I smeared concealer all over my face. The texture on my face wasn't thick like concealer but my brain just couldn't get past how dark the color was. I just felt gross, washed it off halfway through the day. This does seem very popular for people with normal-oily, slightly darker skin though! It has a blurring effect that really smooths the skin out.

**CVS Moisturizing Lotion AM SPF 30**

* $13.79 for 3 oz/89 mL ($0.16/mL)
* Filters: Homosalate, Octinoxate, Zinc Oxide, Octocrylene
* Contains silicone, fatty alcohol, ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, glycerin
* The Cerave knockoff (Cerave really broke me out). I like that it is a hybrid chemical/physical sunscreen, let me test my theory about a sensitivity to avobenzone. Had to rub it in longer than usual to get rid of minimal white cast. Left my skin shiny and slightly sticky, so not very elegant. Pills slightly when layered over moisturizer. I wanted to love it for the ingredient list, but it made my face red. I didn’t feel the heat/irritation I get from other chemical sunscreens but I might be sensitive to any chemical filters, not just avobenzone. Slight irritant around eyes, collected in the eyelid crease.

**Biore Kids UV Milk SPF 50 PA ++++**

* $9.75-12.50 for 90 mL ($0.11-0.14/mL)
* Filters: Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul A Plus & Uvinul T 150
* Contains silicone, fatty alcohol, petroleum
* Feels hydrating, goes on like a thin lotion. It soaks into the skin quickly with no white cast, maintains a dewy finish all day. My forehead, which is usually shiny, did seem a bit oily by the end of the day. Doesn't irritate my eyes at all. Skin feels soft, not sticky and non-irritated, but it definitely made my cheeks red. My face is clearly sensitive to chemical sunscreens. I've actually been using this for my neck/chest/hands because it's such a nice sunscreen otherwise and is very affordable.

**Kiss Me Mommy UV Mild Gel SPF 33 PA+++**

* $14-23 for 100 mL ($0.14-0.23/mL)
* Filters: Octinoxate & Uvinul A Plus
* Contains hyaluronic acid, aloe vera, jojoba oil
* Feels like a thin lotion, glides on smoothly, dries dewy. There was no white cast and it felt very moisturizing. Unfortunately it made me red, and it slightly irritated my eyes. It didn't make my face feel hot but it looked pretty irritated. I also wasn't too keen on this one due to the PA+++ rating. Comes in a very cute package but it is not made for travel. If you lose the extra little piece of plastic that locks it, you can't take it anywhere.

**Sunplay Baby Milk Sunblock SPF 34 PA+++**

* $9-11 for 40 mL ($0.23-0.28/mL)
* Filters: Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide
* Contains silicone, glycerin, hyaluronic acid, vit E
* Damn near HG status. Slight white cast that fades quickly compared to other physical sunscreens. Love the watery liquid texture, it's very easy to layer and apply the recommended amount. It is very runny though. Dries dewy. Luckily it is so gentle it didn't irritate my eyes. It felt soothing on my skin and didn't feel drying. I always wore moisturizer under it though, can't vouch for how moisturizing it is by itself. Only reason I kept looking is because it’s only PA+++, since starting tret I would like the highest available protection. 

**Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk SPF 50+ PA++++ (Blue)**

* $11.50-15 for 40 mL ($0.29-0.38/mL)
* Filters: Zinc Oxide, Octinoxate & Uvinul A Plus
* Contains silicone, hyaluronic acid, collagen, glycerin
* This has a thick liquid texture and feels very luxurious to apply. Even with zinc oxide there is no white cast, though I do have very pale skin. I wore it half/half with Purito Centella Unscented for a few days because I couldn't initially tell much of a difference between them once on my skin. Skin Aqua feels a bit more like a makeup primer due to silicone, making the skin very smooth and soft. It gives my skin a mostly matte, slightly dewy look, even taming my seemingly perma-shiny forehead. No eye irritation. I was really impressed, I thought I would be sensitive to any chemical filters in sunscreen but this is very gentle. Ultimately Skin Aqua doesn't have as many soothing/healing ingredients as Purito, so it falls to second place.

**Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sun SPF 50+ PA++++**

* $15-17 for 60 mL ($0.25-0.28/mL)
* Filters: Uvinul A Plus & Uvinul T 150
* Contains fatty alcohol, centella asiatica (3 forms), vit E, niacinamide, glycerin, hyaluronic acid
* HG! Finally! It looks like a lotion with a slight yellow-green tint but quickly melts to a liquid texture that is easy to apply. No eye irritation. The tint might help counter my redness, it might also just be the soothing ingredients doing their work. It feels cool on application whereas other products stored in the same cabinet feel room temp, don't know how that works but I love it. I tried it because the centella in my LRP Cicaplast is so effective. It doesn’t have the same soothing power as the Cicaplast but works well to keep my face calm throughout the day. Takes a while to dry down, and leaves a very slightly sticky texture. Fine with me, I try not to touch my face. It dries mostly matte to slightly dewy, and also somehow controls my forehead shine. I regularly apply a second layer halfway through the day just to help control redness, I don't usually need to reapply due to a limited amount of sun exposure.

---

**Swatch Time**

Tested all on my forearm because the skin there is very similar in shade to my face, without the distracting redness/pimples. My face has gone through a lot of changes during this testing period due to hormonal breakouts, starting tret, and purging, so selfies weren't very useful for this. Pictures were taken near my window in slightly overcast weather.

[First five sunscreen globs](https://imgur.com/LgRTFeF). And [after rubbing in for 20-30 seconds](https://imgur.com/nZ8nNJz).

* Left to right: Neutrogena Liquid, Neutrogena SheerZinc, Supergoop Unseen, Australian Gold Tinted, CVS AM
* Clearly SheerZinc leaves a strong white cast, and Australian gold is too tinted for me. It's a little hard to see next to the AG, but the CVS AM left a very slight white cast that usually fades after ~15 minutes. I also accidentally didn't use a big enough glob of Supergoop, but honestly it wouldn't have changed much. It's almost completely clear and dries matte even with multiple layers.

[Last five sunscreen globs](https://imgur.com/iSit19D). And [after rubbing in for ~20 seconds](https://imgur.com/rjZuFqq) (basically just a pic of my arm).

* Left to right: Biore UV Kids, Kiss Me Mommy UV Mild Gel, Sunplay Baby Milk, Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk, Purito Centella Unscented
* [Closeup of Purito and Skin Aqua](https://imgur.com/mzLqmit) to show yellow-green tint of Purito.
* The second, rubbed in picture shows barely anything because these are all very cosmetically elegant sunscreens. There is an ever so slight white cast around my scratch where the physical Sunplay Baby Milk was applied, but even that tiny amount fades after a few minutes. There is also a very slight distinction between the Skin Aqua and Purito, because the Purito calmed/covered the slight pink tone in my skin. Not sure if you all can see any of that in the photos, but I noticed the slight difference in person.

[PSA] Probiotics can be a valuable addition to a healthy skincare routine,"In my early 20s my dermatologist diagnosed me with rosacea after going in for a consultation about cystic acne. She prescribed a sulfacetamide wash, prescription strength azelaic acid, dapsone gel, and a non-comedogenic moisturizer. It cleared it up in a few months and I switched over to a benzoyl peroxide wash and the same moisturizer for maintenance, and occasionally spot treating with the azelaic acid. It seemed like the azelaic acid did the brunt of the work but I was happy to have great clear skin and not worry too much about what exactly was the most important factor.

But a year ago, now in my early 30s, the rosacea and cysts came back with an intensity I hadn't seen in like a decade. I went to my GP and asked for the same scrip assuming it would resolve everything again.  I went on this Rx in early March, and it was then late August and, while it had reduced the intensity, the worst part was still stubbornly sticking around in reduced form, and I would get cystic outbreaks. Frustrated, I didn't know what to do but just assumed it was my new normal.

About that same time, I decided I wasn't getting enough vegetables in my diet just for general health - I couldn't eat them fast enough before most of them would rot within a couple days in my fridge, and then I would go without any significant vegetables the rest of the week. So I looked into preservation techniques, especially fermentation because a friend was doing that. I started consistently drinking kombucha every day and eating homemade sauerkraut, both of which a friend made and gave me, and within a couple weeks my skin transformed into radiant clear skin, the best I've ever had, after months with dermatologist prescribed medications not seeming able to really solve the problem.

I was really intrigued by this and decided to do some research. I found various primary research but \[this post seemed very useful with extensive detail that linked to some resources about the science of probiotics and health, including for acne\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5a985x/research\_probiotics\_for\_skin\_a\_breakdown\_of\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/5a985x/research_probiotics_for_skin_a_breakdown_of_the/)) by /u/sssfc. I can't know for certain that the sudden improvement in my skin was from the probiotics or just the tail end of persistent routine with the other skincare products, or some temporal flux in my hormones or stress, because this wasn't a scientific study, just my anecdotal experience... but the immediacy with which things cleared up and the alignment with the change in my diet to include a consistent probiotic load (and more vegetables), and that there is actual research supporting a connection between the two, made me think there might be a connection for me, and that others might benefit from this knowledge as well. Shoutout to /r/fermentation if this resonates with anyone who wants to experiment, you can find great resources there about fermenting your own probiotics, and I just finished my own first batch of sauerkraut to see if this is just a delicious experiment or something that's really helping my skin!",1570041042.0,0.9,24

[Skin Concerns] Red skin after using Differin (Adapalene),"Hello,

Last summer I had pretty bad acne. My routine back then was almost nonexistent. I didn't know much about it, I had some scrub, moisturizer I'd use occasionally. So I decided to go to a dermatologist. She prescribed me Tetralysal, Clindamycin gel and adapalene (It's called Acnelec but I guess it's like Differin, it's 0.1% adapalene) So my acne slowly started going away I'd also implemented other things to my skincare routine like a Neutrogena Cleanser, Water Gel Cream, moisturizer, spinning brush. My acne slowly started going away. I've already stopped using the clindamycin and Tetralysal 2 weeks ago (I'd been using it for 2 months). My skin is now almost clear aside from some very minor PIH and an occasional spot.  The problem is that about 3 weeks ago I'd noticed that my skin is pretty red, then one day (about 2 weeks ago) I noticed that my face is very red and warm. A couple of days later I'd stopped taking the antibiotics and I'd also suspected my cleanser to cause the irritation so I stopped using it altogether and switched to water and hemp seed oil with tea tree oil. I'd also bought TO Niacinamide + Zinc. The redness has calmed down a bit but it's still red. I don't know what else could be causing it if not the adapalene. I read that skin might take up to 3 months to get used to it (I've been using it for about 8 weeks).

&#x200B;

My current skincare routine:

AM

Washing my face with hemp seed oil + tea tree oil 10:1 ratio

TO niacinamide + zinc

&#x200B;

PM

Washing my face with hemp seed oil (without tea tree oil)

Adapalene 0.1%

&#x200B;

After I'd switched to this minimal skincare routine the redness has calmed down but it's still very much visible. My skin is also very oily.

&#x200B;

So my question would be could this still be my skin reacting to adapalene? What should I do now? I thought about adding TO [Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-hyaluronic-acid-2pct-b5-60ml?redir=1) or [**Marine Hyaluronics**](https://theordinary.com/product/rdn-marine-hyaluronics-30ml?redir=1)**.**  I know I don't use sunscreen but the weather where I live is now like 10-15 degrees with no sun, it's raining all the time and I spend very little time outside.

i started curology on august 12, and have loved the results so far. my prescription is .009% tretinoin, 1% clindamycin, and 9% azelaic acid. it's made more of an impact on my hormonal acne and closed comodones than anything i've ever tried. i've seen a noticeable difference in my skin tone and overall smoothness. however, this week i've started to noticed peeling around my mouth and nose, and on my chin. my skin overall doesn't feel dry or tight, and doesn't look like it's dehydrated, but it just keeps peeling in those areas. i know most people experience dryness when they first start curology, but it seems odd to me that it's starting now after 7 weeks on it without experiencing dryness.

this has been my routine since day 1 on curology:

AM: after shower, mix TO vitamin c suspension 30% in silicone with hada labo gokujyun premium and apply. follow with TO natural moisturizing factors mixed with a drop of first aid beauty cannabis and oat dry oil. apply missha all around safe block.

PM: remove makeup with banila clean it zero, cleanse with cosrx good morning cleanser. mix two pumps of curology with hada labo gokujyun premium and apply. wait for it to sink it. follow with cerave in the tub mixed with two drops of first aid beauty cannabis and oat dry oil.

i've been struggling with acne on my chin since around 16-17 i think (26 now).it's not **too** bad but it's still annoying as fuck.i've always been a big picker and squeezer and that definitely hasn't helped as now i don't only have the pimples (and milia/closed comedones) but also just general redness due to picking.. not quite scars as they're not deep or anything, just the area in general is a bit off in colour.

i know most chin pimples are hormonal so a regular/strict skincare routine might not be able to fix the problem but of course helps.

i've been using *cetaphil* gentle skin cleanser and *benzac ac 25mg* cream but it doesn't seem to be doing anything drastic.

i finished the *benzac ac 25mg* yesterday so i went to get some more today but they only had *50mg* so i guess i'm bumping up that dose.

my overall skin looks fine, i don't get pimples anywhere else and the occasional small bump on my forehead doesn't really bother me.

now i'm kind of asking you guys if you have any specific tips for hormonal/period pimples + milia.. as these two things tend to be super hard to get rid of and seems to maybe be a more internal problem than actual skincare routine.

My main concern is to know if it is safe. I have 12 points needles as well as nano needles. I'm thinking I should use the nano on the lips, as it is targeted specifically for collagen production.  
I also would like to note that I saw a few videos,when searching for glycolic peel at home tutorials, of women doing it on their lips? I was wondering if it was common procedure or even safe, for that matter. I'll just fine with using lipstick to fix the slight darkening at the edges of my lips, but I'll ask just in case, if someone has any recommended products for discoloration of the lips as well.

[Routine Help] [Acne] The Ordinary Lineup,"I've been looking at creating a regimen for my skin as it has begun to clear up from a second round of acne and what's left is mainly post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and some light scarring. My skin is a mixture of acne-prone, sensitive and combination --I'd say. Anyhow, I was devising a regimen with TO products that are of interest to me. I used TO before once my skin cleared up a few years back and it has helped but I fell off the tracks of consistency and got acne once again.

My main goal is to get my skin clear from the scars and hyperpigmentation, I have dark Asian/bronze/Filipino skin. Improvements to my skin texture and complexion are also the goal!

NOTE: I am currently using Adapalene + Benzoyl Peroxide (Epiduo) in the morning and Tazorotene (0.1%) cream at night. I plan to introduce these gradually so as to be gentle on my skin. Also, I don't really use toner for my skin. I'm also a male if that makes any difference.

THE LINEUP:

*MORNING*

* CosRX Good Morning Cleanser /alternate/ 2% Salicylic Acid Wash (either Neutrogena, La-Roche Posay or Alba Botanica)
* T.O. 10% Niacinamide + 1% Zinc /alternate/ 8% Ascorbic Acid + 2% Alpha Arbutin
* Epiduo (every other day) or T.O. Marine Hyaluronics

*NIGHT*

* CosRX Good Morning Cleanser
* T.O. 10% Niacinamide + 1% Zinc /*alternate*/ 8% Ascorbic Acid + 2% Alpha Arbutin
* Tazorac/Tazorotene (every other night) or T.O. Marine Hyaluronics

*MASKS/TREATMENTS (at night)*

* T.O. 30% AHA + 2% BHA Peeling Solution (1-2/week)
* T.O. Alpha Lipoic Acid 5%

Please let me know what you think:

I was also considering:

* Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5
* Amino Acids + B5
* Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA
* Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%

Please let me know what you think or have any suggestions to improve this. I would appreciate if anyone else has any experience or input on the specific The Ordinary products that I mentioned as the ones I chose for my regimen appear to be the best fit for me -- it's just an overwhelming amount to choose from! Any help with choosing the right products also helps!

[Routine Help] Weaning off Differin,"I've been using Differin for over a year now, and I'm on the last tube of my prescription. I developed acne after trying out hormonal BC a few years ago, went on oral antibiotics and [acnatac](https://medicines.org.au/product.cfm?type=cmi&handle=gocacnat) for about 6 months, and when that ran out switched to Differin. My acne has mostly cleared up, I still get the occasional hormonal breakout on my chin, but it's nothing that would make me go see a doctor again. My skin has also gotten quite dry during the past few years, and I only use Differin 3-5 times a week and only on the parts of my face that can tolerate it (chin, forehead).

I am not planning on renewing my Differin prescription, but I am wondering how should I wean myself off of it and if I should replace it with something new in my routine. As I mentioned, acne is no longer an issue but my skin is quite dry and occasionally just peels off by itself, and I would like to get something for exfoliation. My current routine is extremely simple:

AM

* rinse with water
* moisturize with Aqualan L ([INCI](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_abf3148617.html))

PM

* wash with Aqualan L
* Differin to problem areas that don't feel too dry (not every day, only 3-5 times a week)
* moisturize with Aqualan L

I'm slightly worried that the acne will come back when my Differin runs out. I would also like to do something about the peeling/flaking issue. Any recommendations? I have to admit that I'm not exactly a skincare addict and probably only willing to commit to one new product, if necessary.

[DIY] Repurposing used coffee grounds for scrubs,"Hi everyone!

So, I got a French press (!!!) and I make my own coffee using grounds now. Used to be a serial instant-cup user. Anyways, I love coffee body scrubs and I was wondering if I could reuse my French press grounds to make a scrub. Two questions though...

[Routine Help] Unsure about products Derm prescribed with Epiduo forte,"So about a week ago the dermatologist put me on Epiduo (generic version Edit:  0.1% adapalene and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide) and I asked if she could suggest products for my skin. She suggested that I use Zo skin Healths exfoliating cleanser with little jojoba esters and Salicylic acid and she suggested I exfoliate with their polish twice a week. After I left I realized that this routine is a lot for anyone’s skin to handle and if you read the Epiduo instructions it says not to use harsh cleansers/scrubs with the medication. 

I have not been able to get in touch with the office quite yet and I have been using it with the Epiduo. I haven’t seen many issues yet except dryness and peeling but I’m not sure if that’s the medication or the fact that I’m using the exfoliating cleanser.

I've always generally had oily skin but since I started shaving my head (over two years ago) it's gotten far more noticeable (no hair to absorb the oil) and it hasn't stabilised or gotten better with time, or with the routine. 

Current routine is morning and night:

2. Paula's Choice 2% BHA
3. Hyaluronic Lotion moisturiser

Basically, I never really had severe acne but it still caused me such mental problems that I wanted to go on accutane for 6 months and that is exactly what I did. So now, I get like 0 acne and have maybe 1 zit on my face that just came, and they go away in like 2 days, it’s literally one zit per month (if that) so thats not a problem. BUT, after the accutane I have severe post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation and some post-inflammatory hyper erythema. I’ve been to my derm about it and also got a second opinion from a esthetician. I know vitamin C and skin brightening is what I need. I don’t want to do hydroquinone for obvious reasons. So far my routine is:

Morning: Cetaphil Cleanser C+ Correcting Complex 30% from Relentless Innovation Cetaphil Moisturizer La Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral(spf50)

Night time: Cetaphil Cleanser Retin-A .05% Cetaphil Moisturizer.

I wanted to use an exfoliate or mask and asked about it but apparantly retina does all that already. I already eat super healthy, I cut out sugar and a lot of dairy. I workout and wash my face if I sweat from it. I change my pillow sheets, keep my room cold so the pores don’t open up. Eat Salmon cause apparently it’s good for acne and also wear sunscreen everyday. Just wondering what else I should be doing or try anything else? I’ve been off accutane for 3 months now so it’s too early for microneedling or a Vbeam(I thought this would help). My skin is like extremely smooth, it’s just super red that it gives off the appearance of acne even when I don’t have it.

"[PSA] If someone is happy with their skincare routine and are having good results, giving unsolicited advice that they should change their routine to follow traditional ""skincare rules"" is unhelpful and is almost always based in misinformation.","I think many of us have been in this situation; where you're talking about yours or someone else's routine, and suddenly there comes a gentle:

""Actualllyyy...that's not great for your skin.""

I think most people, myself included, can hear the subtle determination in this person's voice to inform us that something we're doing is wrong or unhealthy, so we choose the path of least confrontation and give a, ""Oh, thanks for telling me!"" or something of that nature.

LET'S CLEAR SOME THINGS UP.

1.) There is nothing UNHEALTHY about using a potentially irritating or drying product if your skin likes it and doesn't react that way to it. This is why some of people's favorite moisturizers have alcohol in them, and why some of people's favorite cleansers contain high alkalinity soaps, fragrances, and exfoliants. They CAN be irritating to some, but if someone has glowing, moist skin from using them, then there is no reason to stop unless there's some evidence that it causes health problems. There is no evidence that there is somehow some kind of invisible ""damage"" being done or that it's somehow unhealthy for the skin just because it's LIKELY to irritate others when compared to a ""sensitive skincare"" product. A lot of unsolicited advice comes from this standpoint.

2.) There is nothing wrong with not having any skincare products (besides sunscreen when needed) and just rinsing with water if it makes you and your skin happy. MANY people (especially oily skinned folks) do great just maintaining the natural oils on the face. 

3.) Especially for darker skinned folks, WEARING SUNSCREEN AS NEEDED IS OKAY. You DO NOT have to religiously slather sunscreen all over your body every day if you live in Vermont because skincare laws tell us that ""*UV rays are always present so you always need to be protected"".* Wearing sunscreen every day is certainly good for your skin, but depending on who and where you are, it can be very reasonable to only apply as needed, which for many is when we know we'll get a little color if we don't put on sunscreen before going out, or when we know we'll be in the sun for X amount of time depending on the person.

4.) Occlusives/emollients alone can heal dry skin. Every time occlusives like vaseline or some kind of oil are brought up, someone rushes in to say, ""THAT'S NOT REALLY A MOISTURIZER, IT JUST TRAPS EXISTING WATER UNDER THE SKIN AND WILL DO NOTHING FOR DRY SKIN."" This is not accurate, and it's really funny because these products have miraculously healed people's dry skin for generations, and now that people can use the internet and read about the difference between occlusives, humectants, and emollients, they suddenly believe that it's been one great misconception, and these people would do much better with a *Healthy combination of humectants, emollients, and occlusives™*. This can be true; a lot of the time results are much better when moisturizers include these ingredients. However, to say that petrolatum or any other ""incomplete"" moisturizer in r/skincareaddiction's eyes *do nothing to hydrate or moisturize on their own* is simply false. This is something where clearly there is no agreement on how exactly these things work to heal skin, because different dermatologists will tell you different things. What I've been told by my dermatologist is that normally, your skin is able to hydrate itself as long as it can retain the water, and occlusives allow your skin's own moisture to be regained underneath the protective barrier. Most people who have used ""ointments"" like this would say that sounds exactly like what happened when they used the product. I think the lack of hard science is why it's easy to tell consumers that vaseline is simply not going to cut it, you need 20 kinds of hyaluronic acid in your moisturizer, because there is simply no one saying, ""Ok those work amazingly, but so does vaseline for many people and that's okay."" Occlusives alone are particularly useful when your skin is extremely dehydrated AND irritated.

A LOT of skincare is not a very exact science at this point, and people preaching to each other like we're all experts because we can use google is just not really resulting in people being informed, but rather people are just regurgitating misinformation that was fed to them by skincare companies or ""gurus"", as well as other well-meaning ""skincare addicts"".

To conclude, if someone has been using bar soap or body lotion on their face for years and they have perfectly hydrated and smooth skin, please don't tell them, ""That's much too harsh for your face, you should try X"". I'm not asking you to refrain from saying it in order to be nice, but to refrain from saying it because you are wrong.

[Routine Help] wash off mineral sunscreen," hi! ive been trying to find a cleanser that is, preferably natural, but if not that doesnt contain any harsh alcohols or sulfates. but i feel like with anything but alcohol and sulfates, my sunscreen doesnt wash off? if i drag my nail across my skin after using a say, oil cleanser, i get a white-ish gray-ish (i cant even tell what colour it is, compared to my nails it looks grey and compared to my skin it looks white) residue left under them. im not sure if that might just be the oils from the cleanser mixed with water collecting under my nail or if its still sunscreen and gunk left. advice and opinions appreciated!",1569971293.0,0.67,4
[Acne] Fungal Acne on forehead? Not sure what caused it or how to treat.,"[Acne] Fungal Acne on forehead? Not sure what caused it or how to treat.

Hi Everyone,

Would love some input on my acne issue I am having currently. About 6 or 8 months ago I saw a dermatologist to see how I can treat my large pores around my nose and moderate acne. She prescribed a Clindamycin and Tretinoin gel. After a month of using this my skin are great, pores looked better and little to no acne. Fast forward to a month ago I began to break out small bumps on the middle of my forehead 
[forehead ](https://imgur.com/a/NYnwiit)

I have read that antibiotics can cause this type of acne? The gel is an antibiotic and vitamin A type gel I believe. Maybe I should stop using it on my forehead? Or can anyone recommend any products I can use on this area?
I used to never get acne on my forehead so I am at a loss right now. I have another derm appointment in a few weeks so I will Be mentioning this.

Any info is much appreciated thanks!

UPDATE: 

Went out and got Clean & Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser with Benzoyl Peroxide (10%). As well as Witch hazel toner. My skin kinda feels better even after once use? Could be because I have fairly oily skin and I just washed it off. 

Going to use these for a week instead of the Clindamycin/Tretinoin gel and see if there’s any improvement.",1569969708.0,0.6,4
[skin concerns] moisturizer makes my skin horribly oily but if I don’t use moisturizer my skin gets so dry it pulls.,"Hi everyone! I’m a 22 yo female and I’m having a lot of trouble finding a good moisturizer. I use epiduo for acne and wash my face with revision skin care papaya wash. This keep my acne under control but ever since I started on this regimen 7 months ago my face has been super sensitive to any moisturizer I put on it. (Currently using Aveeno sensitive skin, have also tried aveeno clear complexion and olay in the past). If I don’t moisturize, my skin gets so dry that it literally pulls my eyelids taut, but when I do moisturize it gets so out of control oily that i have to constantly be wiping it off and I can’t even wear makeup due to the grease because it doesn’t stay on. This happens even with moisturizer for sensitive skin. It also burns slightly when I put it on. I occasionally wear BB cream but don’t put anything else on my face. I feel kind of at a loss for what to do. Any tips/advice are appreciated :)",1569967643.0,1.0,8
[Acne] Moved abroad and can no longer get my acne cream which contained tretinoin," I used Airol which containts ""tretinoin"" in my first country, but its not available in the country where I live in now. I went to the doctor and he prescribed acnatac gel which contains ""tretinoin"", but also something else called ""clindamycin"". Will I still get the same effect as I did from the first drug? Since the new one also contains tretinoin, but also the new ""clindamycin""? Will I get the effect from both tretinoin and clindamycin making it superior to my first prescription?",1569967413.0,0.6,1

[Routine Help] Where in my routine should I include Hada Labo Premium Lotion?,"I have dehydrated skin and I would like to start using the Hada Labo Premium Lotion but for some reason when I use this first after washing i am finding it extremely sticky and reluctant to absorb fully, despite only using a small amount. This affects the rest of my routine as any products I layer afterwards just sit on top of my skin? Is there anything I can do to prevent this happening? Am I adding it at the wrong time in my routine? 

My routine is currently:- 

1. Oil cleanse with Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil followed up with Hada Labo Gokujyun Cleanser
2. Apply Hada Labo Premium Lotion
3. Apply Superdrug Simply Pure Hydrating Serum

[skin concerns] benzoyl peroxide is the only thing that prevents my acne but I don’t want to bleach everything I own,"So basically I have a very stubborn jaw and cheek breakout and it responded very well to benzoyl peroxide. My towels, sheets and a beloved (and irreplaceable) fall out boy shirt? Not so much. I really want to stop using it but every time I do it comes back. I’ve tried replacing it with a sulfur mask once there was no active acne but that did little to nothing. My next step is probably gonna have to be going to a doctor to get some kind of prescribed topical that won’t ruin everything I own but I really don’t wanna do that so if anybody knows any antibacterial topicals I could try I would be very grateful. I’m thinking tea tree oil might help because when I mix it in a mud mask the breakout always looks a little better the next day but I don’t really know any way to consistently incorporate a meaningful amount of that without damaging my skin.",1569963180.0,0.89,24

[Skin Concerns] Hyperpigmentation that won't go away," Never had acne in my life, except for maybe when I was in middle school. I am now in my freshman year of college, and I am suffering from something much worse - hyperpigmentation. It's around the corners of my lips and is significantly darker from the rest of my skin. I am a lighter-skinned filipino guy, so you don't have to look too hard to notice that something's out of place. My life since I've been affected by hyperpigmentation has been quite sad - avoiding opportunities to meet new people, staying inside most of the time, and overall became more of an introvert. Whenever I try to go out, I tend to use makeup to hide the hyperpigmentation (which really makes me question my pride as a dude).

Has anyone been in any spot that's relatively similar to mine? I've been looking for solutions for months on end now, only to become more frustrated. I have tried the precision VI peel; it still didn't work. I am going into a dermatologist clinic tomorrow to potentially try a laser treatment.

[acne][routine help] swimming and skincare,"I recently started swimming as a form of exercise and my skin HATES the pool. I have always had acne-prone skin, but for the last year it has been under control. This month my face has broken out terribly: small zits, big zits, white zits, painful zits, neck zits, the whole gang is here. I think I need to adapt my routine to fit my new habits, but I don't know where to start. Here's my information:

-Oily skin, acne prone
-AM: L'Oreal pure-clay cleanser, exfoliate-refine
Thayers witch hazel facial mist, rose petal
10% benzoyl peroxide cream
Trader Joe's oil-free antioxidant facial moisturizer OR CeraVe ultra-light mistruizing lotion with sunscreen (normal to oily skin)
-PM: CeraVe foaming facial cleanser (normal to oily skin)
Thayers witch hazel facial mist, rose petal
10% benzoyl peroxide cream
Trader Joe's oil-free antioxidant facial moisturizer

I used to have a prescription for Benzaclin, but then insurance stopped covering it so I switched to OTC benzoyl peroxide and it's been less effective but fine. 
I've tried salicylic acid in various forms at various points in my life and it does not seem to be an effective treatment for my acne.
My face does not feel any drier or flakier than usual.

If more information is needed, please let me know! This is equal to my post-partum acne which was so brutal and frustrating but at least I knew that had an end point.",1569959293.0,0.81,5
