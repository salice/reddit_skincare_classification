* **The issue(s)** you need help with. It's helpful to put your questions at the top of your comment (especially if it's a long one)!

* **Skin type**. It's OK to be subjective, how do you feel your skin is? Oily, dry? If you need help clarifying, check out [this guide on skin types](https://theacidqueenblog.com/2016/06/23/skin-types-proclivities-and-conditions/)

* **Current routine** with the full names of your products (try to separate it in to Morning, Evening, and Occasionally used)

* **How long** you have been using your current routine, or product in question

* **Anything new** you’ve introduced or started doing that might change the condition of your skin

* **Your location** so we can recommend products/services available to you

#Would you like to give advice?

Firstly, thank you so much for helping out our community - without your knowledge and time ScA would not be the same!

Some things we'd ask for you to keep in mind: please don't just downvote someone's opinion or response because you disagree. 

If you can, please take the time to tell them why you think their advice may be incorrect or harmful. It's better for people to understand why something is a poor choice, instead of just being told that it is one!

[Routine help] should I add a retinol or AHA BHA? Acne scars won't leave me :((((,"So I'm still struggling with acne scars and some occasional acne. I've been doing this routine for about a month and it's definitely helped, but the acne scars (visible pores and indents) are still there:

Morning
African black soap
The body shop tea tree toner
20% Vitamin c + retinol (pura d'or)
Aloe vera gel as moisturizer
Sunscreen

Evening
St Yves clarifying tea tree cleanser
The ordinary glycolic acid toning solution
The ordinary niaciminide
Tea tree oil/hemp seed oil mix as moisturizer

Twice a week: Indian clay mask


I'm going to buy the caffeine solution by TO soon and was considering buying retinol and/or 30% aha bha peel to do once a week or so. Can anyone recommend me anything? Should I get those, or only one, or none? Plz send me your wisdom <3


Also, I contacted the TO support and they recommend that I use the Pore Flush Booster, natural moisturizing factors + HA and Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA. Does anyone else confirm they're worth a buy?",1571802777.0,1.0,8

"[Skin Concerns] Favorite products to combat redness, scaring, and acne?","Throwaway because I'm pretty embarrassed by my skin. I applaud everyone who posts photos!

I need help with my routine, specifically what actives I should add to help get some redness, acne and old scarring under control. Mid 30s female and I feel like I can't get my skin to settle down. I went a bit overboard initially with trying loads of products and couldn't tell what was doing what so I scaled back significantly. I've been on a steady simple routine for the past few months without much improvement.

Skin type: dry, eczema prone, dealing with redness and acne scarring around nose, closed comedones and whiteheads on nose and chin with occasional deep dark painful pimples, dark under eye circles and some hyper-pigmentation.

AM- Rinse water or wash with Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser depending on how my face feels- Thayer's Alcohol Free Toner- Cerave Daily w/SPF 30- Etude House SPF 50 (if I am going to be spending time outside or if it's summer - I live in the PNW and work in an office, so usually I feel like the Cerave is enough)

PM- Banila Cleanse it Zero (love this for melting off eye makeup) or Garnier pink Micellar water if I am not wearing much makeup- Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser- Cerave tub

I've tried adding a few things into this routine:- Stridex Red every other day - Did this for weeks and no change- Pixi Glow Tonic every other day - I didn't use this very long but didn't see much change either- Ordinary Granactive Retinoid in Squalene - Have used once a week for 6 weeks with not much change, going to start twice a week

I've been toying with the idea of trying a different toner or adding different actives, specifically the Ordinary Azealic acid or Ordinary Niacinamide. Or is it time to see a dermatologist? I don't have a ton of acne but what I do have has been bothering me for years (especially my forever red and scarred nose). Ugh!

I'd love some input from y'all!",1571799202.0,1.0,4
[Misc] What is the best inexpensive oil based cleanser that really works?,"I have been having trouble with my closed comedones on my forehead lately. I have tried salicylic acid, witch hazel, Nizoral, etc. I havent tried an oil cleanser but feel it might help because I have combination skin. My forehead has never been this bad...",1571799121.0,0.72,8
[Miscellaneous] A bunch of silly questions from a confused lurker.,"1. What exactly is a toner?  
  

2. How do you apply multiple layers of moisturizer without your face becoming an oil well?  
  
  
  
3. Why does every moisturizer I use give my face a shine or oily appearance. When I pass under a light it looks like I just ran a marathon.



4. How can people do ""contact treatment"" of their skin by leaving their cleanser on? I was told to leave it on for like 10 seconds at most, and if I leave it on for 60 seconds it sucks all the oil and moisture out of my skin and leaves it dry.

5. How am I supposed to use BP? Everytime I apply it it just dries the hell out of the skin in that area, and leaves a residue from the white cream. I'll use it as a spot treatment once and have peeling skin/residue in that area for a week.

6. When I apply a product to my face, am I spreading the acne germs around? Like if I pass a cotton pad with moisturizer over a pimple and then onto an area of my skin that is acne free, am I spreading the acne to that area?

7. Is it always a bad thing if a product burns, even just slightly? For instance a moisturizer with salicylic acid seems to me like it should burn slightly since it is an acid and it is supposed to enlarge pores. 

8. Why is it so difficult to find a good moisturizer? I have tried Cerave regular (made my skin tingle and slightly itch, made my skin oily at the end of the day), Nivea classic (way too heavy, made my skin so shiny), Clean & Cleanser moisturizer with salicylic acid (probably the best yet but made my skin slightly burn and sometimes tingle and itch slightly). 

9. When people say that their skin feels hydrated do they just mean shiny? Because sure if I apply like a ton of vaseline then my skin will be 100% hydrated but I will also look like a lunatic. 

10. Why is my face constantly itching (like tiny pricks of a needle, sometimes hurtful that last for like 10 naghing seconds) even though I applied a moisturizer? 

11. When ppl say they get acne on their jawline, do they mean like only on the 1 inch strip of skin along their jawline, or also like lower cheek/sideburns/chin.

12. Is it possible to get hormonal acne as a guy?

13. Can having shiny skin after applying a moisturizer clog my pores and cause acne?

14. Is it fine to apply products with a cotton makeup pad instead of fingertips?",1571798754.0,0.5,1

[Skin Concerns] Am I Overtreating?,"I’ve been using Differin for 6-8 months now and rarely experience irritation. Recently my dermatologist prescribed 0.3% adapalene gel so I could continue to have the acne control plus increased anti aging . I’ve been alternating the 0.3% with the OTC 0.1% so as not to overwhelm my skin. I’m also trying out a Murad product for dark spots. It’s 2% hydroquinone plus glycolic acid, which I’m using every other morning. 

My skin doesn’t feel dry or dehydrated but at night my skin stings just slightly when I use Thayers alcohol free toner. The weird thing is, I use that same toner in the morning in lieu of face wash and it doesn’t sting then. Is a little bit of stinging okay when skin is adjusting to new products, or do I need to introduce them even more slowly? Overall, I think I’m pretty gentle on my skin. My full routine is below as an FYI. (On mobile, apologies for formatting)

P.M. 

1. 1st cleanse: Burt’s Bees oil cleanser

[Routine Help] How do I incorporate Pixi Glow Tonic and other questions. 27/F Pale ginger with light freckles.,"I bought a sample bottle of Glow Tonic and have been using it for the last 3 evenings. Is using PGT every evening too much for someone just getting into AHA? I have dry/normal skin and can be sensitive to fragrances. My main concern is the small blackheads on either side of my nose and flakiness in the creases of my nose which is why I thought an AHA would be useful. I think I might be experiencing purging due to the increased texture of the blackheads, do I need to be concerned about that? Also, how do I incorporate retinol? Other than the blackheads/texture I'm concerned about aging.

My current routine is:
PM
Coconut oil if I am wearing eye makeup 

Micellar Water if I am wearing makeup 

Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser with a manual silicone ""brush""

Pixi Glow Tonic (replaced Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel Mist)

TruSkin Naturals Vitamin C Serum (not sure if this is actually doing anything)

Shiseado White Lucent Eye Cream (I like the moisturizing aspect of this and the thickness but I need to replace it with something less expensive and it doesn't do anything for dark circles as it promises. Also might be causing mild milia.)

Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer+ (Been using this since I was a teenager but when I run out I might try using CeraVe Moisturizing Cream which I use on my hands every night)

AM
Water

Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel Mist

CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 (this can feel a little heavy sometimes and has a strong sunblock smell but it's the only sunscreen I've found that doesn't burn under my eyes)

[Acne] Intense chin breakout,"Photos taken exactly a week apart. My chin has always been slightly problematic-rough texture, slight scarring, and the occasional cystic zit. Basically photo 1.

Then suddenly, with no change in diet, routine, lifestyle, etc., the below happens. I use a sulfate and fluoride free toothpaste (Jasons). No picking or popping. I am extremely committed to my routine even when drunk. Yet, fate is cruel.

Is this perioral dermatitis? Hormones? Slow-moving azelaic acid purge (started 1 month ago)? Do people even purge this badly from azelaic acid? Do I become a hydrocolloid bandage soaked in spearmint tea?

I hope to resolve this with topical meds but am open-minded to oral alternatives. I sadly have to wear makeup for work as I regularly see clients (just a light cc cream and lipstick).

Eternally grateful for any help.

[Skin Concerns] Skin Irritation/Burn,"Last evening before leaving work, I got a small chemical burn above my forehead. From the moment I saw it to now (almost 24hrs later) its still leaking clear water looking substance from there even though there is no real redness or burning.

I’ve talked to poison control twice, pharmacist, who sent me to ER Dr, Family Dr and 811 and non can figure out why its leaking water from it.

 They all say just keep washing it, don’t put poly etc on it. Dr said try milk or baking soda but I’m worried that will cause and infection. Tried poly now because I got tired of nothing happening, makes it burn more



Just texture change which is hard to notice and constant very little burning and water “weeping” from it (exactly like water not even plasma looking). Gets worst when exposed to air compared to kept dry under gauze/ band aid.

I don’t get how it could be the paint thinner/reducer/hardener as I’ve been working with these products for years and have had them splash on me before. They burn and cause redness and irritation that you won’t ignore. However this was so subtle when it was burning at work I didn’t think much of it.

Only other things that it could be is fibre glass (material or glue). Also I had pimples there, maybe some of it went inside that area? Especially after having gone to a RMT after shower and leaving the lotion on for the rest of the day, could whatever was there have created something and once I went to work on Monday it flaired up?",1571787715.0,1.0,2

[Acne] Seeking Advice for Chronic Acne,"I've had acne since I was 12, and have been going to the dermatologist since. I've tried everything-- every Rx topical treatment, every over-the-counter acne treatment, antibiotics, different types of birth control, I even went on Accutane for two months. Currently, my skin is worse than it has ever been. My skin is extremely sensitive after taking Accutane so my skin can no longer handle harsh acne treatments with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, but with a completely gentle routine, there's nothing to get my acne to calm down. I'm not sure if this is a hormonal issue, I feel like I've tried everything and at a loss for what to do. I only use clean towels on my face, I change my pillowcases regularly, I don't touch or pick at my face, I never pop pimples, I drink a lot of water, I avoid dairy, I wear sunscreen every day and am religious about my skincare routine. 

Right now my skincare routine is:

AM: Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser, Mario Badescu Rose Water and Aloe Spray, Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Moisturizer, Glossier Bubblewrap Eye Cream, and It Cosmetics Bye-Bye Foundation Full Coverage Moisturizer with SPF 50

PM: Bioderma Micellar Water, Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser, (every other night) Krave Beauty Kale-lalu-yAHA chemical exfoliant, Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief serum,  Neutrogena Hydroboost Gel Moisturize, and Glossier Bubblewrap Eye Cream.

I used to use washes with salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide, use clindamycin, tretinoin, and spot treatments, but my skin was so inflamed, irritated, and worse than it is now. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I get new breakouts every day, but my skin is also very red and I have a lot of flat red marks where acne used to be which makes my skin look worse. I also have a lot of hyperpigmentation from my years of acne.

[Skin Concerns] Can you get blackheads from bruising your face?,"I honestly feel kind of crazy for asking this because it seems kind of ridiculous that bruising could lead to blackheads but I honestly have no clue what to make of my current predicament...  


Over a week ago I got hit by a ball right in the middle of my glasses on the bridge of my nose. I did a good job icing it and it was sore for a few days and was definitely swollen and a bit bruised in the days after.  


Fast forward to now, about a week and a half later. There really isn't much swelling (if any at all) but where my bruises were on the top of the bridge of my nose and the right side of my nose (where the bruises were) there are what appear to be blackheads.   


I am in my 20s and have never had a single blackhead in my entire life so I don't think they naturally appeared there. I didn't change my skincare routine or anything in the time after I got hurt so I am genuinely freaked out and don't know what to do about this. These things that appear to be blackheads in the spots where I previously had bruising have been visible for a few days now. Is it possible that there is some sort of bruising underneath my top layer of skin and its showing through my pores? Or are these really blackheads caused by trauma to my nose?",1571781849.0,1.0,1

[acne] Has anyone taken their IUD out because of acne? Closed comedones galore (29/F),"I had been taking oral contraceptives for years before getting a Mirena. I broke out on my forehead (closed comedones) but was given tret/clindamycin and it died down afterwards. I chalked it up to transitioning from oral cont to Mirena.

A few years later, the acne has now returned. I have closed comedones all over my forehead and, during specific times of the month, the comedones become inflamed and painful. I also get cysts on my chin. It feels like braille on my forehead. None of it is terrible (according to my husband, but I suppose he has to say that), but I have never experienced this acne in my life (teens included) and it really hits my confidence hard during these times of the month and the discoloration from the acne has started building up.

I eat well, drink plenty of water, and take care of my skin. I've tried dietary changes (quitting dairy, etc.), hundreds of dollars worth of skincare, facials... some of helped but ultimately I've realized my acne is hormonal. I have great weeks where my skin is happy and then, along with bloating and the other lady-time-of-the-month things, my acne comes back.

**Has anyone experienced this acne with Mirena? Has anyone gone BACK to oral contraceptives?** I was a happy camper for a few years with Mirena but it really seems to be the culprit the last few years. I've asked my doctor to go back to oral contraceptives and she's put me on Junel to take for a few months along with keeping my IUD. If my acne improves I'll take my IUD out.

My current regime:

AM

Clinique Moisture Surge 72-Hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator  
Eucerin Sunscreen

PM

DOUBLE CLEANSE  
Acure Micellar Water  
Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Cloud Cream Cleanser  
Curology (just started, not sure how it's working so far? It is niacinimide, azelaic acid, and clindamycin)  
Clinique Moisture Surge 72-Hour Auto-Replenishing Hydrator

Past things I've used:  
The Ordinary AHA/BHA Peel (the vampire blood colored one): I think I used it too much and it made my skin freak out  
Witch Hazel  
Cetaphil cleanser  
Cetaphil moisturizer (I used to use this all the time but have since stopped)  
Tret/clidamycin - I've stopped using tret, and I think it really ruined my skin barrier.  
I've been seeing a esthetician who is wonderful, although I really think this is hormonal and there's only been minor improvements.

Thank you in advance! This is my first post so let me know if I should add any more info.

I use tretinoin, C, peptides, sunscreen, nuface, coQ, basically Hot& Flashy's routine. Will adding a spot treatment of tret during the day help or hurt? Glycolic swab a few times?

"Why do dermatologists ""prescribe"" such expensive skincare products (or have expensive skincare lines that they recommend to their patients)? [Misc]","I recently visited a dermatologist who, after seeing my skin (severe acne), recommended products from the skinceuticals. The total price for the 3 serums  + derma roller that she recommended came to almost **$800.00.** 

However, I felt like this was a huge mark up. The derma roller she recommended was almost $150.00 (when I have seen them for way cheaper on Amazon). And this is something I have noticed at most dermatology clinics where they have ridiculously expensive skincare products. He also never prescribed me anything like Retin-A, tretinoin, 

However, whenever I come on reddit, I always see testimonials (and I can also attest) to people having good results w/ the ordinary, K-beauty, drunk elephant etc. I know some of these might be expensive, but one serum at my dermatologist's office was $200.00

I was wondering why dermatologists carry such expensive products in their office? Are they worth buying?

Which bitches said castor oil doesn't cause hair to grow [Review],"Product: PraNaturals Cold Pressed Castor Oil

Used it for 6 days or a week 

Got it on Amazon; the packaging was just the oil tub wrapped in plastic 

Product is thick and viscous and smell isnt very pleasant tbh so just add a drop or two of tea tree oil lol


Positives:
Never told my family i was using it and two different people in my family said how dark thick and longer my eyelashes and eyebrows were. Whoever is selling the idea that castor oil doesnt work for hair growth is bullshitting (but presumably to sell another non-castor hair growth product)
Can also be used for other things apparently such as stretch marks or dry skin if used in small quantities with a lotion

Negatives: Smell, thickness, use tea tree oil for relief from smell 

It does do what it said it would do. I advise you to get cold pressed castor oil which is pure instead of ones with other ingredients added.

Conclusion: Used castor oil, im a male, and they grew in less than a week considerably (and i *mean* it)

This has been on my mind a lot lately ever since getting serious about suncare and protecting my skin with sunscreen.

I know I have to reapply throughout the day, but I cannot get over the thought of doing this.

I have OCD and part of that comes having a phobia of germs. I am posting this in hopes of getting some insight about reapplying throughout the day.

Let me first start off by saying my skin is incredibly oily, I have a fear of spreading all of that oil and dirt / pollutants collected on my skin throughout the day when reapplying sunscreen.

Even after blotting my face, I still feel as if my face is 'dirty' and don't want to be reapplying a product to dirty skin.

I wash my hands many times throughout the day, but still, even after washing them, I still feel like there are germs that will be spread on my face. 

How does this work and how do you reapply sunscreen throughout the day.

[Routine Help] HELP: went on a skincare purchasing spree and not sure which of the 'Actives' products I should prioritise/can mix together," 

I’ve recently decided to incorporate some of products listed below into my skin care routine (such as the retinol, BHA and salicylic acid) after reading some of the threads here and also getting recs from friends. Still super clueless as to how I can mix some of these (pretty sure retinol doesnt go well with salicylic acid or Benzoyl Peroxide for example) so was wondering if I can get some help on constructing (and differentiating) my AM and PM routines. 

The one step I always include is to clean my face with micellar water, but other than that I have no fixed order of things (which I am sure would make things easier and more efficient). Also I usually save the Vitamin C serum only for days when I’ve been tanning as I know it doesn’t help with the absorption of some of these products apparently. Aware of the Cleansers > Actives > Everything else order but a lot of the products I am unsure about fall in the middle so would appreciate any help. 

On a good day, my skin looks pretty alright except for visible pores around the nose area and blackheads on the nose itself once you look closer (wish the photo quality wasn’t this good):

\^this is something I want to prioritise because I’ve had them since I remember. I was thinking of starting with the BHA liquid + clay mask? how long should I wait for before applying the mask tho?

Also, in the days leading up to my period I always get minor breakouts around the chin area which is super annoying, but for the first time ever breakouts like this on my forehead appeared overnight (which prompted me to go on a skincare purchasing spree):

**Background of my skin:**

* Mid-20's Chinese, Male, Acne-prone + oily skin  


**Process + Results:**

*  For the first 2.5 weeks: I used only these products — oil cleanser, foam cleanser, physical exfoliator, essence, niacinamide, eye cream, benzoyl peroxide, brightening cream moisturizer, salicylic oil, spf, masks (clay/sheet), retinol( my skin purged for these 2.5 weeks, I also had to stop using AHA/BHA & Benzoyl Peroxide for a week because my skin was VERY sensitive) — my acne scars did fade out a little bit though.
*  2.5 weeks - 1 month: I incorporated the Vitamin C Serum into my regimen, at the 1 month mark, I did notice that my acne scars faded out more
*  1 month - Now(October 22, 2019): I incorporated the products — Gentle Brightening AHA/BHA Toner,  Pore Control Serum.  


**Some FYIs:**

* My eye isn't really all that great when it comes to seeing if my  overall skin texture is more even/smooth,brighter (this is kinda ironic and sad at the same time). Though I can see noticeable acne scars fading.
* My problems area regarding my pores is around my T-zone, nose and cheeks. I haven't seen much improvement in the appearance of my pores. (I know that you can't physically decrease the pore size). I did however see a little bit of improvement right under my lacrimal papilla near the top of my nose for both left and right.   


**The downs(problems?):** 

* After incorporating the Clarin's Pore Control Serum, I noticed when I nudge my palms together, (dead skin?) starts forming, this happens on my face when I nudge a spot as well. Is this normal? Currently, there isn't as much (skin?) that forms when I nudge a spot on my face now.
* After applying niacinmaide in my regimen for both day/night. I feel that my face is burning a little bit, this never happened before when I use niacinmaide.
*  I notice that the area under my eye (not really my eye area) is red . I can confirm that this is not eczema as it's not itchy.
*  Applying Benzoyl Peroxide after moisturizer burns a little bit. Then the pain goes away after 15-secs\~. This is probably normal right??

&#x200B;

**My question for you:**

*  Should I change anything in my day/night routine? 
* How long does pore-minimizing products have an effect on pores? 1 month? 2 months? 5 months?
*  I assume the skin below is my eye is a little bit compromised cause it's red. Should I stop my regimen for a week(basically just removing the actives\[AHA/BHA/Vitamin C/Retinol\]) until my skin is better?

  
I purposely didn't disclose most of the products I used. But if there is enough people who wants to know, I'll update this post with the product names.

[Sun Care] Will using chemical sunscreen over moisturizer ever work?,"Hey folks, I'm not a huge skincare addict but I've had a decent little routine for a couple of years that works for me. I've been consistently using the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50 sunscreen once in the morning at the end of my routine (hyaluronic acid, vitamin C 12%, TO natural moisturizing factors). I try and wait half an hour before going out but I don't always have time so it's 50/50 really. I was instructed by a friend who is super into this stuff to use it like this, but just learnt that it's a chemical sunscreen and is supposed to be applied before moisturizer. Will it have ever been effective being applied beforehand?

My second question on this theme is how often should I reapply? I live in a VERY sunny place (Denver), with bright sunshine most days all year round, although I spend most of my days in an office far away from the windows (it's not as bleak as it sounds). I reapply sometimes if I'm out all day over the top of whatever is on my skin, but obviously it is not practical to do this in future if it means taking off and reapplying all my makeup in the middle of the day.",1571762519.0,0.4,4

[skin concerns] My skin isn't getting better and I'm feeling beyond hopeless and depressed.,"I've posted on this subreddit before with skin concerns. This past year has been the worst for my skin with itchy eyes, waking up with a rash in the centre of my face, hives, cold sores, and awful gritty feeling. I've been patch tested and there is nothing I reacted to that I'd be coming into contact with. I've been using 0 products and have been trying to just leave my skin alone. When I do, it's still a bit rash but calmer but it never totally goes away. When I woke up this morning, it was super flakey so I applied Avene's Tolerance Extreme Emulsion (Water (Avène Thermal Spring Water), Squalane, Behenyl Alcohol, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycern, Sodium Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer) and a minute later, this happened:

[Routine Help] Need advice about my skincare routine!,"I  have been visiting a dermatologist for over a year now, they had  initially prescribed me Tretinoin for my acne to use on a nightly basis.  I used it almost nightly (though I recently started to switch to \~2-3  times a week now due to it drying up my eye areas). My dermatologist  also recently told me to add on Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide in the  mornings. I was told to use it was a spot treatment rather than applying  it all over my face.

My main  question regarding this is, having used Tretinoin for nearly a year, and  adding on Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide, how long should I be on  these creams, is this essentially a life-time kind of commitment? In  terms of moisturizing to combat the dryness, I have used Cerave PM (in  the mornings) and some generic Nivea cream, but I am also open to other  cheapish alternatives!

And  finally, I don't necessarily have dry hands, but during the winter  months it does get flakey and sometimes cracks develop near the nails. I  have used Cerave in the tub to moisturize my hands, and while I do  think it is okay, is there other alternative options that work best for  hands moisturizing? Or would using Cerave be good enough? I have seen  folks in the past use Lubriderm, Aveeno and so forth.

My skin is also very sensitive. I stopped using a lot of products because I was getting redness around my nose and mouth. Stopping helped the redness go away, but now I really want to focus on improving my skin more.

- moisturize with cerave moisturizing cream 
- apply cc cream that has spf

PM
- cleanse with skinceuticals soothing cleanser
- skinceuticals equalizing toner 
- moisturize with cerave moisturizing cream

Some things to note:

- some nights I use the khiels cannabis sativa seed oil herbal concentrate. I got as a free sample and I’m liking it so far. It claims to help with redness, hydration, and helping the skin’s barrier protect itself
- I tried The Ordinary’s niacinamide + zinc and it made me break out. Did some research and it’s rare but some people can be allergic to it
- I used to use witch hazel toner and this is what I believe caused the redness in my skin
- I always remove makeup before exercising 
- I drink plenty of water and eat healthy for the most part 
- change my pillowcases every 3-4 days 
- I take birth control which has helped over the years with acne - I used to get a lot of cystic acne

- my oily skin
- blackheads on my chin, and nose that never go away.

[Miscellaneous] A Very Comprehensive Guide to Vetting Products Before Purchase!,"With ~~Drunk Elephant~~ (whoa little Freudian slip there), er ***Sunday Riley*** recently being [gently scolded by the FTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dl7ca6/miscellaneous_the_ftc_said_sunday_riley_faked/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) for fake reviews on Sephora’s website, I’ve seen a lot of confusion and doubt about how to actually find legitimate reviews for products online. I consider myself to be a Jedi Knight in the fine art of Googling and whatever the Jedi equivalent of a Black Belt is in cutting through bullshit, and have honed and crafted my vetting process over many moons of… Googling and cutting through bullshit. Man sometimes a sentence just doesn’t end with that bang you imagined.

I thought I’d share my steps here so you can grab and pick out what you will, and hopefully feel a little less overwhelmed by the fact that everything you read is probably a lie!

**Overview** of the steps I'll cover below in far more detail-

1. Look at what it's supposed to do and throw ingredients list into Cosdna
2. Look only at negative reviews; filter from lowest to highest rated. Ignore 4/5 star reviews
3. Use Google to search for reviews from many different sources (i.e. Google ""{{Product Name}} Reviews"")
4. Get sample if possible; Buy smallest size possible

&#x200B;

**Phase One: Basic Recon** *Oh that product has piqued my interest! What fine retailers might I purchase it at?*

Sometimes I’ll come across a product that has a *je ne sais quoi* about it. Let’s take a real life example from those naughty little review fakers at Sunday Riley and use their Good Genes as our product to research. Few products have been as mega-hyped as Good Genes because *Oprah* loved it and she’s still a thing (maybe? Didn't OWN flop?) and it took off from there. So you'd start with knowing a few things about yourself and what you're looking for.

1. Skin Type (I'm Oily-to-normal)
2. Main Concern you're looking to address with this product (I'm looking to combat acne and large pores + even out my skin tone)
3. What you're comfortable spending (I'm Mid-range to High-end: Not super concerned about a price tag if it’s gonna work. But like not Barbara Sturm $300 for freaking Hyaluronic Acid expensive. We'll call that ""stupid expensive"".)

So let's say I’m all starry-eyed over Good Genes because I got a little short changed on legit good genes and if *The Secret* taught me anything it’s that I bring into my life what I desire. I want good genes so maybe this is the Universe being like- “Hey, I dropped some shit off at Sephora for you.” I first will go to the product's page at Sephora and take a look at two things: the product’s claims and its ingredients.

[Good Gene's Sephora Page](https://www.sephora.com/product/good-genes-all-in-one-lactic-acid-treatment-P309308?skuId=1418581&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716881_53825939500_pla-419039569134_1418581_257731947995_9029600_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&ds_rl=1261471&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsfGr0eOu5QIVdB-tBh1d3QRzEAQYASABEgJZH_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

So for Good Genes we have the following on it's ""About Me"" section:

""**What it is:** An all-in-one AHA treatment, powered by lactic acid, that clarifies, smooths, and retexturizes the appearance of skin.

**Skin Type:** Normal, Dry, Combination, and Oily

**Skincare Concerns:** Fine lines and wrinkles, Pores, Dark spots""

Ok, all of that sounds great and just what I’m looking for- so far so good. If that doesn't sound like what you want from a product just bail at this point. Also, please never put any stock in the “Clinical Results” section of the page that a lot of websites have. Go ahead and read the results for Good Genes and you'll see what I mean.

Now I move on to the ingredients. I usually do a spot check on how far down any of their key ingredients are depending on the product (i.e. if it’s a serum or a moisturizer), but the most important part here for me is to throw the ingredients into Cosdna and see what pops out. I don’t put *huge* stock in comedogenic ratings, but I still want to know if there are any potentially acne-causing ingredients right up top. Likewise with irritants. **Note on Cosdna**: DO NOT TRUST THE PRODUCTS ALREADY IN COSDNA! Ever notice there are like 15 versions of popular products in the Cosdna database and all are like, 1-5 ingredient different from each other? Do **NOT** trust people to copy + paste properly. Not to mention companies change their formulations preeeetty frequently. No, take the time to copy the ingredients from the store's website (bonus points for hitting both the company’s website *and* the retailers, because if there is a formulation change it’ll always be live for the company first- retailers can be slow to update) and paste them into Cosdna’s “analyze ingredients” section. [http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ingredients.php)

So for Good Genes there is nothing I’m super jazzed about, and there are quite a few possibly comedogenic ingredients + a lot of fancy schmancy extracts (*Lady’s Slipper Orchid Extract?! Give me a f-ing break)* that I’m sure are like only grown on the Isle of Man and harvested by nubile young women after a milk bath or something bizarre. Given that there are a lot of potential acne triggers I’m going to be on the lookout for this in reviews. And feel free to tag in for my example of ""acne"" whatever your particular bête noire is. If you have dry skin and a product has ingredients like alcohol and you’re like 'oh hey that’s drying' then you’ll be watching for that in reviews.

&#x200B;

**Phase Two: The Reviews** *Reading how much people hate things and getting a lesson in how amazingly awful everyone’s spelling and grammar has become!*

Now the fun part, let’s read some reviews! I am now going to share with you my secret to getting the deets on products, right after I tell you about Skillshare! Ha. Ok my secret: I don’t give two shits, or even *one* shit, about the positive reviews. I don’t care that someone thinks Good Genes is awesome. I mean frankly Oprah already told us it was awesome so if you think you’re better then Oprah then you’re stupid and wrong. No matter what site I’m on the first thing I do is filter by “Lowest to Highest Rating.” (Side note: Ever wonder how to spot a fake review from a mile away without needing some computer to do the work? Ever notice how the 5 star reviews are always beautiful, ripe, lusciously complete sentences while the 1 stars are like “this waz trash i hat it awful!!!!” If a review *sounds* polished and put together it most likely was.) In the negative reviews what we are looking for are people with a similar skin type as ours and similar problems they're trying to address. You can pretty easily weed out the people who were hoping for miracles from a product or had an issue with areas outside the formula (company’s customer service, product size, product bottle, etc.) and focus in on those that could apply to you. Let’s snag up a good example for Good Genes from someone that seems to match my skin concerns:

>""Kind of bummed...  
>  
>I wanted so badly to love this. After all the hype and reading all the articles and reviews, I thought this would be magical. I used this faithfully as directed for two months and never noticed a difference in my skin. Nothing seemed brighter, smoother, tighter, etc. I actually stopped using it entirely after the two months because it really broke me out the whole time. I know some said there’s a “purging” period so I kept using it, but no purging period lasts two months. I usually have decently clear skin and this is the only item I changed in my routine that whole time. I gave the rest away to a friend who wanted to try it and hopefully they have better results.”

So honestly Good Genes isn’t sounding too bad after looking through a ton of bad reviews. Mostly people complaining about the smell which like if I can be blunt with you I’d probably put dog poo on my face if I would wake up with perfect skin- call me crazy. A few people reporting breakouts but some sound to me like purging. Ok Sunday, I’m intrigued.

&#x200B;

**Phase Three: Surfing the Web** [*Tubular! Oh shit remember Johnny Tsunami?*](https://images.app.goo.gl/E6Mtr2ncQY5bhxEb7)

Alright, the reviews didn’t turn us off and the ingredients are somewhat promising, so now comes what we'll call ‘casting a wider net’ since we're looking further around the inter***net!*** Ha. **Pro-tip**\- pretend no website ever has built in searching. I *promise* you it’s not as good as Google. Take freaking Reddit for example: ever used Reddit’s dumpster fire of a search feature?! Just use Google. First place I go to look for more reviews and info on a product is usually Reddit, so in this case I’d go to Google and type in “Sunday Riley Good Genes Reddit”. I always start more generic and add in words as necessary- like if I needed to add “reviews” on the end to get better results. Now I start picking through it all!  [As you can see here,](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&oq=sunday+riley+good+genes+reddit&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l4.5681j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) there are MANY posts talking about Good Genes already so you’ll find out a lot about it from reading through them.

For products that are perhaps newer or just less well known, you might find you’ll need to branch out from Reddit. In this case we’d just amend our previous Google search to read “Sunday Riley Good Genes Review”. There are a fair few review sites out there (i.e. Influenster) as well as personal blogs that might have tried and reviewed the product. On sites like Influenster same rules apply- ignore positive reviews and sort by lowest to highest. Oh also **IGNORE AMAZON**! To be frank I never buy skin care off of Amazon (or TJ Maxx/Marshalls for that matter), and I would especially never buy something that’s not licensed to be sold on Amazon because the chances of it being a fake/tampered with/expired are around 100%. If you’re ever finding yourself purchasing something and it’s cheaper than retail price just walk away. Therefore Amazon’s reviews are useless, because these are people reviewing what is likely not the real product.

“What if my product is *brand* new or so obscure I can’t find reviews on it?”

If it’s brand new I’d suggest looking at similar products from that company if possible to get a feel for them. Unless you *KNOW* a particular ingredient set is exactly what you’re looking I'd advise waiting it out on new products or at the very least getting a sample. My skin is not something I enjoy being adventurous with (but I also said like 3 paragraphs up something about dog poop on my face? so I think I undercut my point here). If a product is not new, and you *still* can’t find *ANYTHING* on it I would: **MAKE SURE THE COMPANY IS LEGIT**!

I have seen a lot of posts recently about people buying 'Provence Beauty' from TJ Maxx. I tried to help someone verify one of their products and couldn’t find ANYTHING on it. The brand themselves seems sketchy at best, and there is not a trace of any of the products that people purchased from TJ Maxx online. If the company seems iffy, *DO NOT BUY SKIN CARE FROM THEM!* It’s not worth it guys. If the company is legit, but just not very mainstream, you might have to go fishing a bit. I had this experience with Renee Rouleau’s products. This is the only time I actually *ask* a question in the Skin Care subreddit because you can find so much by just searching old posts. In this case I’d recommend heading to the Daily Questions thread and asking if anyone has ever tried {{product\_name}}. If you can’t find anyone who has used it, and the company doesn’t do samples, make positively sure they do full refunds (and include return shipping!) because it’s always a gamble.

**Phase Four: I want that.** *<——- Napoleon Dynamite reference! Anyone? WTF that movie came out in 2004 Jesus Christ!*

Ok so at this point you’ve probably made up your mind one way or another about a product and are ready to move forward. Often I find that my original product search has turned me on to a similar product and I am therefore performing this complex mating ritual with several products simultaneously before selecting the most dominant.

Once I have one I’m serious about your first question should be “Can I get a sample?” Ok guys here is the shitty thing with samples of Skin Care- using something for like three days in a row isn’t going to affect you dramatically one way or the other *unless* you have extreme sensitivities. However it *will* help you weed out little things like texture, smell (lol god smell again), feel (too greasy? too oily?), and how it plays with your other products (i.e. pilling). I always get a sample before I buy something if at all possible. Now if it’s *not* possible due to the availability (online only) or the packaging of the product, I’d recommend seeking out a travel size. Funnily enough this is exactly what I did with Good Genes (my take on it? Like basically the skin care equivalent of the shrugging emoji). I found my biggest problem was I’d buy a full-size product since it’s a bEtTeR vAlUe and then never ever finish it because I’d get right past that point of no return (like literally, can’t return it anymore) and then decide it wasn’t doing it and thank you next it (as someone hovering around 30 I can truthfully say I’ve never even heard that song which you can probably tell). So the hierarchy of purchasing goes: **Sample —> Travel-size —> Smallest size available** ***from the store with the best return policy!***

Sephora has a pretty fantastic return policy, so they’re usually my default. Oh Ulta too. I have this weird snobbish thing about Sephora being somehow better than Ulta? **If you are buying online** be diligent about checking return policies! With skin care you need to find out the following:

* How long do I have to return?
* Can I return open and/or used product? Is it unconditional or based on their discretion?
* Does the company pay for my return or will return shipping be deducted from my refund?
* Is this site well known and liked?

For that last point I’d recommend a similar vetting process as the one you just went through for the product itself. For ‘mainstream’ sites like Sephora, Dermstore, major department stores, etc. (lol Ulta didn’t make the list again! Maybe it’s the orange? Is orange just not classy enough?) you can do a spot check of reviews for their customer service, but on the whole this is going to be far more important for niche sites, smaller companies, and Korean/International beauty sites! Doing a Google search for, say, “Yesstyle reddit reviews” or some combo of that will net you most everything you need to know. Once again if you can’t find *anything* on a company I’d steer clear. If you find a product that is still being manufactured (like Good Genes) and it’s cheaper on the website you're looking at then it normally retails for then *it is cheaper for a reason!* Now companies do have sales, so if Neiman Marcus has 15% off skin care or whatever that’s different, but on the whole if some random seller on eBay is selling Good Genes for $30 that’s not a good deal, that’s herpes. Or hepatitis or.. something idk diseases I guess.

Note on Product Returns: I mean obviously as with most things in life the 11th commandment of “Don’t be a dick” applies here and you shouldn’t abuse company’s return policies. I frankly don’t really give a shit about a company’s bottom line so much as it’s just a huge waste of time and resources. But that said if you’re on the fence about a product after a week or so *RETURN IT!* I have done this with many products that I just wasn’t crazy about (lookin at you Protini) and have never regretted and/or repurchased anything yet. You WILL regret keeping around lackluster products.

Actives do create another can of worms with regards to purging and how long you should wait it out, and honestly I could write another post just about purging. Despite some controversy in my super important opinion purging is most definitely a **Thing**. To be *super* brief about it and distill this down to the key points to ask yourself when you’re thinking “Is this a purge or a breakout?” I would have to say it hinges upon two factors: **Where am I breaking out** and **what do the pimples look like**. Ooh I’m going to make a FLOW CHART!

Ok that’s a lot of info so I’ll stop there. Notice I didn’t ask my friends about products they use because A. I don’t have any friends and B. Unless they have very similar skin it’s not really going to matter, but you could always include a ‘human contact’ portion of the vetting process if that’s your thing. Let me know if you have any questions about any of this as, I know vetting products can be really overwhelming for some people and I’d love to help you feel more secure in your purchases and find products that will actually work for you!

My skin flakes around the nose and the pimples I get are all on my cheeks/jaw/chin and usually never form a head, is this closed comedones? My skin always looks red, not sure if its marks or the acne since I can pick at it sometimes.

[acne] Can someone help me out with what may be causing this whiteheads/pustules? not sure what they are,"Hi All!

I seem to be waking up with a couple whiteheads every morning usually around my mouth but sometimes on my chin too. I have very dry/dehyrdated skin so I am currently only using cleanser and moisturizer. So there are a couple of things I am speculating

\-Skin is dehydrated and these are a result of dehydration

\-clogged pores due to the fact I am not using any topicals

\-Perioral Dermatitis

\-Hormonal Outbreak

Does anyone else have these and would like to recommend how I get rid of them? if a topical then would prefer something not horribly strong so it doesn't mess with my skin barrier. I am going to get a hydra facial on Friday to get rid of some redness and hopefully these whiteheads.

[Skin Concerns] Please Help!! Quick question about sebaceous filaments getting worse after changing my bha,"Hey guys!! I can’t find a concrete answer anywhere to this so...
I’ve been using PC 2% bha and 8% aha every night for a while now to clear 20 years of huge sebaceous filaments on my nose without much improvement (as well as OCM and increasing hydration and moisture). I upped the bha 2 nights ago to PC 4% and my SFs are darker and more noticeable. Does congestion go thru a purging process like acne? I got 4 ugly zits in normal places that are already healing so I am purging a little, but the look of my pores...? Is it normal for SFs to get a little worse before better?  The rest of my face is responding nicely with a minor purge and no dehydration. And (yay!!!) a 6 month old blackhead I’ve been trying to extract practically fell out of my face within 8 hours of using the 4%. But the SFs look a tad worse and I’m concerned.

[routine help] Help me create a routine from a basically nonexistent one?,"Routine creation help

Hi friends, this is my first post to skincare addiction after scouring the subreddit for a solid 2 hours. So much amazing information but feeling overwhelmed! 

My current skincare routine is pretty lacklustre. I usually buy some kind of cleanser from Winners that looks cool and use that morning and night. 

I moisturize with Caudalie Vinopure Skin Perfecting Mattifying Fluid in the morning, but nothing at night. 

Sunscreen is pretty non existent except in the summer months when I am on the ocean. I do use Shiseido Urban Environment Tinted UV Protector minimally - once a week at best. 

I used to use Lierec Paris High Peel and that banished my flakes but didn’t seem to cause any redness or issues. I can’t find the product anymore. Womp. 

Skin type is dehydrated oily. It’s gross. I have flakey skin between my brows, on my nose and sometimes on the sides of my chin. My forehead and nose are usually quite slick and I do have the odd breakout but I wouldn’t say I’m acne prone. 

I would love to be rid of the flaky skin and tame the oil down a bit and really just all around take care of this face. 

Can anyone recommend a starting point to a routine that could combat my issues? I don’t have a budget, and am willing to spend good money on quality product but obviously don’t mind cheaper products that work, too.

[acne] [product question] how do I clear my fungal acne??,"Okay, so first I want to start off my saying I have gone to the derm and been diagnosed with fungal acne! Since then, I have tried 2% keto cream, lotrimin ultra, stridex, clean and clear toner with SA, happy cappy zinc shampoo (which I found helps a little bit, but I’ve been using it for a month and my forehead still has hundreds of bumps on it and it’s showing no sign of improvement, just staying the same.) I’ve used econazole nitrate (which I’m using with my happy cappy shampoo and I don’t think it’s helping at all, but it’s also not making it worse so I’m continuing to use it.) and I’ve used sulfur which doesn’t work for my skin at all and made it look awful. 
I’ve tried Avène cleansing foam and it made my skin breakout. And I’ve tried the hada labo skin plumping gel which also made my skin breakout.
My current routine is vanicream cleanser, happy cappy shampoo, garnier SkinActive Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream, then econazole. (I’ve been on this routine for a month now and it’s now clearing.) 
I’ve been on an oral anti fungal for a month now, with no signs of clearing. And I’ve been taking a zinc supplement, which I just quit because I saw no improvements. 
I literally have been to the derm 4 times in the past few months and I’ve been dealing with this for almost 6 months now. I literally cannot look in the mirror throughout the day. I hate it. Someone please send suggestions on creams to try or something. Please.

[Routine Help] A Couple Of Questions About Oil Cleansing,"Hey Everyone!

I have been using the Oil Cleansing Method for a few weeks now and my skin seems to be reacting very well. I haven't had a serious breakout since I started and my skin seems to be healing better and faster. I just have two questions that I hope someone can answer for me.

1. A lot of people talk about double-cleansing but after seeing the results of plain oil cleansing, I'm kind of afraid of using normal cleansers again. I don't wear make-up so the only thing I usually have on my face is sunscreen, which an oil cleanser can remove on it's own. So if I oil cleanse with an oil containing an emulsifier that allows the oil to mix with water and rinse off, is a second cleanse with a gentle water based cleanser necessary?
2. If oil cleansing can allegedly remove things like sebum and dead skin cells, is it still necessary to do my weekly exfoliation?

Thank You!",1571740962.0,1.0,10
[Acne] What is causing this??,"I don't need a diagnoses (Obviously!) But I've LITERALLY never suffered with acne until I became an adult and it's so frustrating, especially when I wash my face every night but when I wake up sometimes it's worse so I'm questioning if what I do at night isn't helping. 

My morning is usually very light, I just cleanse with water, mist with rose water and put on a moisturizer. At night I cleanse with African black soap, a witch hazel rose water toner and then apple cider vinegar as a second toner I guess, then occasionally an oil (Coconut, argan, castor). I've always used these products so I don't know why recently it's been an issue. But it seems like when I take a break from them, nothing bad happens and things get a but better for a little. Is my skin just getting used to them and I need to switch up? How do I determine what thing it is that my skin is freaking out about?

[acne] New change in routine,"[my skin today](https://imgur.com/gallery/s0eW08f)

All my life I have had very clear skin and probably only two pimples which went away very quickly. Then last September I started uni and my skin started breaking out - not cystic acne but about 5-10 spots on my face, mainly on my forehead and cheek and they left a red mark for weeks after they’d disappeared. I thought it was because I was very stressed at uni and not taking good care of myself - lack of sleep, extremely depressed and too much caffeine etc. 

In January I left uni and focused on myself and went to therapy, started eating healthier, used skincare for the first time in my life. But nothing really changed and my face always has about 5 spots, still on my forehead and cheek and now closed comedones everywhere. I’ve been through a few different skincare routines but right now I’ve been using a 5% glycolic acid tonic and Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturising gel, with occasional overnight use of benzoyl peroxide on the bad spots. I also wash my face with soap in the shower and this has seemed to help a little bit with the amount of spots I get. But this routine has left my skin really dry and sore and obviously isn’t working on my acne.

I feel bad complaining because I know my skin isn’t as bad as what other people have to deal with but it really affects my mental health as my body image is low anyway. I’ve been thinking about focusing on rehydrating my skin and abandoning all the drying products - specifically I’ve been looking into buying the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturiser as well as some sort of SPF product (currently I use none which I know is bad, especially when using glycolic acid) and just sticking with these three products. I’m going on holiday in two weeks and I’d love for my skin to be better by then as I’m getting some professional photos taken.

Any help? Am I going down completely the wrong route? Any products which would work better? Thanks",1571734316.0,1.0,6

[acne] not sure what to do about acne,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some advice. First of all I just want to say I'm new to this sub but honestly the amount of resources is just incredible so thank you! I'll be sure to search around for specific product recommendations, I guess this post is more about whether to go back to a professional or not (I have some products in mind, recommendations still welcome though). Basically I've had acne for a long time but I've only recently been getting into skincare and I really want to start clearing up my skin. The acne on my face has been around since puberty (I'm 19 now), over the last year or so I've been struggling with body acne as well. I have yet to sort out a good routine so at the moment I am only using:

Clinique cleansing balm to take off makeup

Neutrogena Extra Gentle cleanser

Neutrogena oil-free moisture for sensitive skin/the one with spf if I'm going outside (I know it's only spf 15, still on the hunt for a good sunscreen and I think I might try some of the ones recommended in this sub!)

My skin type is combination and quite sensitive (oily t zone but also dry/flaky patches occasionally, thinking of adding in hyaluronic acid to hydrate). Not sure how much detail to go into but on my face and upper back I get quite big pimples though not cysts (so whiteheads I guess?), on my upper arms and thighs I get much smaller, really tiny inflamed bumps (doctor said this was acne mixing with keratosis pilaris, thinking of getting the Cerave SA bodywash and moisturizer for that)

I have been to my doctor and also a dermatologist who have recommended isotretinoin/accutane but I'm honestly terrified of the side effects. From what I've gathered accutane is only prescribed in the USA when things like antibiotics and topicals have failed, that's not the case where I live, I haven't tried any other acne treatment yet. I went back to my doctor and asked what other she options there are. She has her own cosmetic clinic on the side through which she sells products by a brand called Aspect Dr and recommended the [Problem Skin serum](https://i.imgur.com/JQ5X3Kn.png) and [AHA/BHA cleanser](https://i.imgur.com/9wuBQzJ.png). I had a look at the products and while ""all natural"" they are full of fragrance, essential oils, a bunch of citrus extracts... I feel like they would be way too harsh for me and am honestly kind of confused that a doctor would recommend those products, or is it just me? I'm kind of stuck on where to go next, should I try out the products my doctor recommends anyway, or just try and figure out a good routine on my own? I'm thinking I could find some less irritating (and much less expensive) products with AHA/BHA if that's the right kind of thing for me, or benzyl peroxide,  or retinol? Is it worth going back to a dermatologist (maybe they can recommend products)?

Honestly when I look at myself barefaced and see all my acne I worry that I should have just gone on the accutane, but then just thinking about it makes me anxious. I can always try it if nothing else works right?  Ugh this whole skin thing has been so stressuful.

AM: 
Clinique liquid cleanser mild- I really am liking this cleanser, doesn't leave me feeling dry or irritated and gets my makeup and whatever else off! 
Acnedote 2% salicylic acid astringent- not loving this.. VERY harsh and doesn't seem to be doing much

Also, for moisturizer- I am open to any suggestions, honestly. I just need something that won't clog my pores or leave me red.

[Review] LRP Cicaplast Mains: a non-goopy occlusive,"La Roche Posay’s Cicaplast Mains is a hand cream (sold in Europe and Canada), but lately I’ve been using it on my face as an occlusive with great results.

It comes out as an ointment similar to petrolatum-based products (Vaseline, Aquaphor, CeraVe Ointment, etc.) but when it glides on, the effect is much less shiny than petrolatum and much less tacky as well. It also has somewhat of a pore-minimizing effect (probably on account of the dimethicone). When I wear this, my skin becomes so bouncy and plumped and moist, and it stays that way all day—signatures of a good occlusive!

I highly recommend this as an alternative to petrolatum if you don’t like slug-lyfin’. This works especially well as a day occlusive. I don’t find I need to use additional lotion/cream under it either, since it’s “hydrating” (water + glycerin humectant) and emollient (fatty alcohols and shea butter)—so this is a 3-in-1 product for me. Bonus: It has 4% niacinamide!

(Side note: I’m prone to breakouts and this has not exacerbated any problems for me. I’m one of those unfortunate people who get closed comedones from CeraVe-in-the-tube and CeraVe PM, so this may be worth trying if you’re in the same boat.)

The CeraVe is fungal acne safe, but also breaks me out and burns my face so so badly. I turn beet red after using it.

"[Routine Help] After a terrible breakout, I need help optimizing my current routine to fight PIE, dryness, and closed comedones.","Hi everyone! I’ve been a loooong time lurker (like, since 2014) and finally got the nerve to post. I hope I've formatted this correctly. 

**The issue(s):** 

I had a pretty bad acne breakout back in April 2019 when I went off Spiro to try more ""natural"" alternatives (bad idea). A few moves and job stress didn’t help either. Now, I’m back on Spiro and my skin has calmed down a LOT. I haven't had a breakout in a few weeks :) 

I also realized I may have some sensitivities to silicones, because when I stoped using my very silicone-y sunscreen (Cotz), I also stopped breaking out as much. My current routine is silicone-free. 

I’ve had fungal acne in the past—diagnosed by a dermatologist—so I also try to avoid fungal acne triggers as well! 

I need some help figuring out how to get rid of leftover PIE, deal with lingering closed comedones, and combat some dryness. My skin feels PARCHED right now and I haven’t been able to find a moisturizer that is silicone-free, FA safe, and moisturizing enough. 

Here are my questions: 

* Are there any glaring mistakes in my routine that may be exacerbating my skin concerns?
* I’ve looked into incorporating a vitamin C serum—would you all recommend this? 
* Do you have any recos for a moisturizer that is FA safe and silicone-free? I’ve thought about the Sidmool Royal Honey Peptide Deep Moisture Sleeping Pack or the Krave Oat So Simple Water Cream to use at night. 
* Are there any other ingredients that I should try to incorporate right now? 
* I still have closed comedones around my chin, despite using adapalene. Should I consider introducing an AHA to my active rotation? Or switching to tret? 

**Skin type:** Combination–definitely more dry than oily with the season change though! 

**Location:** North Carolina 

**Current routine:** 

AM: 

* Cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio H20 or Dr. Eddie’s Happy Cappy shampoo a couple times a week (for fungal acne maintenance)  
* A few times a week - [Acne.org](http://acne.org/) BP short contact therapy on any active pimples (wash off after 3 mins) 
* A’pieu Madecassoside Ampoule for redness
* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid (not totally FA safe but it doesn’t make me break out) 
* Sidmool Madagascar Real Moisture Cream (this is fine, but doesn’t seem to moisturize very well)
* Sunscreen: A’pieu Soo Boo Ji Cotton SPF50+ PA++++ 

PM: 

* Cleanse with Vanicream
* A’pieu Madecassoside Ampoule for redness
* Actives (on rotation—I try to give my skin a break from actives at least 3 days out of the week): 
   * Adapalene 0.3% 
   * GOW Azelaic Acid 8% 
* Dr. Jart Ceramidin Liquid 
* Sidmool Madagascar Real Moisture Cream
* Timeless Squalane 

I also take:

* Spironolactone (25 mg, morning and night) 
* HUM Probiotics",1571686238.0,1.0,1

[routine help] Looking for a face mask to get all the gunk out!,"I came down with a severe cold last week and am still recovering. As I was in my bed for two straight days, my skin was unintentionally neglected since I couldn't even get up to wash my face. I was also eating a lot of carbs and fast foods while I was staying home.

"[Product Question] The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% reformulated, with storage new instructions","So I recently picked up a bottle of The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid 5% from a Deciem store (it's been out of stock online forever). I noticed that it has a new ingredients list and it comes with new use instructions. Specifically, it says to use it up within 3 months of opening (old bottle said 6 months) AND it says to refrigerate after opening (old bottle said ""store in a cool, dry place""). This is pretty crazy to me. It makes it seem like the granactive retinoid is not as stable as they claim, if it has to be used up so quickly and also refrigerated?! Any thoughts on what the deal is here? Granactive retinoid (aka HPR) is supposed to be MORE stable than retinol, not less, and the only skincare products I've ever heard of as benefitting from refrigeration are vitamin C serums.

Would it be overkill or too harsh to use the Alpha Arbutin and Azelaic Acid at the same time? Should I consider alternating them each day?

So this product is instantly moisturizing and I love the texture and use it in conjunction with my other water based serums to boost thief effects. My issue is the two ingredients they used to make this product. Phenoxyethanol is a common personal care preservative. It is an effective bactericide and has recently been widely used to replace parabens, especially in natural products. Phenoxyethanol has been found to be toxic to the body even in small doses.
In order to create it, the known skin carcinogen, ethylene oxide is combined with a phenol (a chemical compound which is also considered a carcinogen). The process of creating phenoxyethanol may (depending on each manufacturer’s production methods) produce the dangerous by- product called 1,4 dioxane. The EPA has established 1,4 dioxane is a probable human carcinogen. The FDA describes it as being able to depress the nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea. The product’s Material Safety Data Sheet says that it is harmful if inhaled or swallowed or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The Chemical Toxicity Database lists that phenoxyethanol may cause central nervous system depression, kidney damage, skin irritation, headaches, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness. If inhaled it may cause respiratory and digestive tract irritation. Japan has banned the use of it in all cosmetics",1571667580.0,0.56,8

i have been struggling with acne and oily skin for years now (I am male, asian, have scars from acne and 21 years old), and probably tried every skincare product there is, but I cant seem to find the right products.

This is my current skincare routine:

4. Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (x) (The ordinary)
5. Effaclar SPF 30 (Roche possay, though im not sure if I get oily from this, might have to try a bit longer. Are their SPF 50 products better? like: **ANTHELIOS XL,** LSF 50+ ?)

5. Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA (x) (The ordinary)

My questions:

&#x200B;

1. Should I add something with a vitamin A? (Retinol or Retinoid by the ordinary (Maybe: Granactive Retinoid 2% Emulsion)? If so, what are the differences between Retinol and Retinoid? I tried researching, but I dont really get it lol)
2. If I add something with vitamin A, should I stop using any products? In particular stop with ""REN AHA Ready Steady Glow""? I heard its not good to mix AHA with any vitamin a. If that is true, should I stop one, or could I do AHA in the morning and vitamin a in the evening? or both every second day and not everyday?
3. Is my current skincare too much for my skin? If I need changes, what are those?
4. Should I change the Effaclar SPF 30 with **ANTHELIOS XL,** LSF 50+ ? I feel like it gets my skin a bit oily, but im not sure, since I haven't used it with any moisturiser (it may be from my skin having no moisturiser and thus over oiling?), because it will arrive this week with the other products marked with an ""x"")

So recently my skin has been terrible lately and I suddenly have a break out of all of these tiny invisible bumps on the side of my face that could almost be pimples but I'm unsure.

I generally have a good diet, cleanse and use skincare daily but I am wondering if some of the following factors have influenced my skin problems recently and whether any of you could help me to fix these issues!

Over the past two months;

\- I hardly drink any water daily

\- mental health has declined and have been really stressed and down

\- stopped using acids before bed (lactic and retinol) because I ran out lol

\- exfoliating more than usual

\- sleeping regularly and eating well (no heavy meals, no candy etc)

\- drinking more alcohol than usual?

\- have been off the contraceptive pill

After washing, there was much burning sensation or anything. It just looked bad. 

After about an hour or so, I checked again and now my skin was normal. Those patches had disappeared. So I went on with my routine, applied some Alpha Arbutin and then moisturizer on top and went to bed. All seemed fine.

However, in the morning, the areas which had burning sensation when I had applied the peel and had that fresh burnt skin after washing, are not turned dark red/brown. Its really worrying me now. There is no burning sensation or pain. These spots are just there. I have applied moisturizer and sun screen.

I have no idea what caused this sudden reaction even thought I have applied this peel several times before without any issue. Any help will be highly appreciated.

[Routine Help] Is there anything glaringly wrong or missing from my skin routine?,"My (26F) skin type is combination / dry with the occasional hormonal, cystic acne breakout around period time. I live in the UK, so dry skin is quite a concern of mine, and something I deal with especially since I use retinol in my routine. 

I am currently struggling with these small white head / comedonal acne around my chin/cheek area. I'm not too sure what this is from, and am a bit afraid of experimentally adding in or taking away from my current routine for the risk of making it worse. At the moment it's not at all noticeable (only to me and then others when I pick at it).

My primary concern at the moment is anti-aging. I am quite an expressive person and have started developing lines on my forehead and around my eyes from laughing. These lines aren't fully set in my skin yet, and I'm trying to prevent that from happening as long as I can. 

Any tips/feedback would be most welcome!

[Product Question] Just switched from PC 2% bha to PC 4% bha. Experiences?,"Long time lurker, first time posting!!! 😊 I’ve been using PC 2% bha and PC 8% aha every night for 8-10 weeks to combat the SFs that have lived on my nose since I was 12 (I just turned 40 so like 28 years now). I’m not gonna lie, I was expecting a miracle cure and it never came. In fact, I’ve seen little to no change in that time using this combo. So tonight I started PC 4% bha to see if it helps more. Any experiences with this stronger formulation?  Or suggestions on my routine? My skin is quite oily, used to get dehydrated super easily, until I found my hyaluronic acid and moisturizing routine. 

For reference, my routine for the last 2 months (suggestions, please!!!):

AM:

Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash (I wake up sweaty so water won’t cut it)

Thayers Rose Petal Toner

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Serum w/Hyaluronic Acid

TO Niacinamide/Zinc Serum

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gel Cream w/Hyaluronic Acid

Sunscreen (still shopping around, I was never good about sunscreen until this sub) : Olay Complete spf 30, or Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture with spf 30, or CeraVe AM—don’t love any of them

Elf Poreless Primer and make-up (powder, no liquid foundation)


PM:

Garnier Micellar Water or Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Cleansing Gel to remove make-up

Cetaphil Gentle Face Wash

Thayers Rose Petal Toner

PC 2% bha (4% as of tonight) and PC 8% aha

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Hydrating Serum w/Hyaluronic Acid

TO Niacinamide/Zinc Serum

Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gel Cream w/Hyaluronic Acid

Rosehip Seed Oil mixed with CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion

Every 7-10 Days: TO 30% aha/2% bha peeling mask

Routine has helped my occasional acne come to a head and clear up much faster, but hasn’t done squat to my SFs and blackheads. 

So tonight I switched to 4% bha...
I gave a squeeze to this particular blackhead above my eyebrow that’s been driving me crazy for months. I’ve squeezed this mofo 1000 times and nothing, nada, ZIP! (I know, I know, but it’s just the one and I’m gentle).  I seriously almost peed my pants when the damn thing came out just now. In 3 hours it went from a flat blackhead to a raised/pimple type blemish after applying the 4% for the first time. And a tiny squeeze got me this huuuuuuge hard sebum plug that was never ending.  Just crazy long, idk how that much was in there. And it’s been there for 4-6 months and never budged until I used the 4% bha tonight!!

[acne] Hormonal acne caused by egg donation/fertility treatment?,"Been battling with acne for almost 20 years (29yo now), but for last few years it's been smoother sailing, mostly just texture-issues and occasional (probably fungal) flare-ups. Things got tremendously better 2 years ago when I switched my contraceptive method from pills to patch.

Until all hell broke loose when I donated eggs a few weeks ago. I started the ovarian stimulation injections about 6 weeks ago and the collection was 4 weeks ago - the process is pretty similar to first steps of IVF-treatment, if you're familiar with that. For the last two weeks, my skin has been flipping out: deep cysts on jawline and both sides of nose, tens of small pimples in forehead - the whole awesomeness. I passed it over as fungal first, but Nizoral didn't help, which led me to think it might be from the hormonal treatment, even if it didn't start right away with injections. 

While I definitely do not regret donating, it kinda makes me want to call the clinic and ask them to tell the recipient parents (anonymous donation) that while my other genes might be great, I may have given their kid the worst possible skin genes. ""Just dip her/his face to snail mucin and send them to SCA when it's time"", haha.

Jokes aside, **has anyone experienced this with donating or similar treatment?** How long did it last and did you find some magical helping product?",1571650708.0,0.83,2

My question is whether or not it would be safe to use the AHA after using this face wash, or will it be too harsh on my skin? The lady at the store said that it may be too harsh, but I understand people here use AHAs and BHAs together, so I think it shouldn't be a problem right? I don't have sensitive skin and used the AHA once so far and experienced no problems.

In addition, since I experienced very little discomfort when using the AHA, is it okay if I were to use it daily (of course I will be wearing sunscreen when going out) as I really want to get rid of the hyper-pigmentation.

[Acne] red wine spot treatment wow,"It minimized my pimples so much after one use and made my emerging pimples disappear. It’s been three days and my breakouts are almost gone (it may have minimized pih/scarring but that might just be in my head) I’m impressed. I tried it before as a mask and it was irritating but its perfect as a spot treatment on a q-tip. Stings a little for few seconds. I’m not sure I can recommend it but I think it can be good if you have nothing on hand or are looking for something new to try and not much has worked. If you’re concerned about harsh treatments this would probably be something to give a try in terms of chemicals. It may irritate but it’s safe for most people when it comes to allergies. Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin folk I for sure misused it the first time but I know some people like to be extra about things anyway . I have strong non-sensitive skin. Proceed at your own risk. A diluted spot treatment may be okay for some. It worked for me it might work for you.

[Product Question] Can an OTC Retinol be stronger than Curology Tretinoin .009?,"I just received my trial prescription of Curology last week and have been using it daily since Thursday (recommended M-W-F but the low dose made me decide to go all in).

The formula is: Tretinoin .009% / Azelaic Acid 9% / Clindamycin 1%

Previously I was using Skinceuticals .3 Retinol

The only different I've made is the Skinceuticals I would apply fairly soon after the shower (still moist skin). The Curology isn't immediately after washing my face but I'll still apply a small amount of fluid to help glide the product on my skin (usually just the Evian water spray but have used a hydrating toner).

I am 32/F and was looking for Curology as an anti-aging/treating hyperpigmentation. I have a fair complexion with a lot of sun damage. With the Skinceuticals retinol I feel like I was making progress but wanted to try a Tretinoin product over the winter and see how my skin handles it. I've been on the Skinceuticals for 2 months now and still have been dealing with flakiness but since I stopped one and started the other my flakiness went away and I'm just assuming it's a weaker product. Is that possible? I was afraid of trying tretinoin before going on vacation later this week but at this point I'm already planning on packing it and continuing to use it daily.

Has anyone experienced this while trying curology since the starting % is so much lower? I already planned on asking to remove the clindamycin and am thinking to see if they'd either up the tretinoin or just go to the .5 formula in Skinceuticals.",1571610039.0,0.67,4

[Routine Help] [Acne] Antibiotic-related fungal acne? New products? What is wrong with my face!,"I’ve been on my skincare journey for a little over a year now. I saw significant improvement about a month after switching up my routine last fall and was very pleased. I maybe got one pimple a month around my period that would heal pretty quickly. 

Old routine:

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel
* Rohto Melano CC
* Simple Rich Moisturizer
* Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 50
* Smashbox Camera Ready CC Cream

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* Boscia Purifying Cleansing Gel
* Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel 
* The Ordinary Mandelic Acid/Stridex Red box pads (switch off between nights)
* FAB Ultra Repair Cream
* The Ordinary Argan Oil
* Vaseline (inconsistent use, only when feeling very dry)

Fast forward to spring 2019. I went on really harsh antibiotics for latent tuberculosis and everything was fine right up until I finished my treatment. The last month or so I went to Europe and started using some product samples while I was there and noticed a slight uptick in CCs on my forehead. I returned to my old routine when I got home but things just got worse from there. By August my forehead was a war zone, small CCs everywhere with a couple inflamed ones at any given time. After doing some research I thought this might be FA from the harsh antibiotics so I started doing Nizoral masks and taking probiotics to try to get my own microbiome back full force. My face would look improved in the morning but then progressively worse by the end of the day so I decided I would never know if it was fungal unless I actually changed my whole routine to be FA safe. What a pain that was. It took me about a month and a half to completely change it because I didn’t want to change everything at once to make sure I wasn’t reacting to any particular product, but this is my new routine (bolded are new products): 

**AM**

* Rinse face with water
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* **Banana Boat Kids Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50**
* **Supergoop!CC Cream Daily Correct**

**PM**

* Garnier Micellar Water (blue cap)
* **Simple Foaming Cleanser**
* Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera
* Stridex Red box pads (about every other night or so)
* **Aveeno Ultra-Calming Nourishing Night Cream** 
* Vaseline (inconsistent, only when feeling very dry)

Sometimes I’ll do a Nizoral Mask on nights I don’t use the Stridex pads. I’ve been using this entire routine for about 3 weeks now and I honestly just don’t know anymore. I still have a ton of CCs on my forehead. The rest of my face is ok, a couple breakouts here and there but nothing compared to my forehead. It’s really only one half of my forehead too, which I straight up don’t get. I’ll have one day a week where I think, hm maybe it’s actually starting to calm down. Then I wake up the next day to new small CCs and some of the old ones have become inflamed. What’s really irritating is even after coming to a head and healing, the same spot turns right back into a CC that becomes inflamed again a week later. It’s really taken a toll on my confidence and I’m just at a total loss with what to do. Even before I started my routine last fall my face was never this bad. The only conclusion I can draw are the antibiotics but I’ve been off them for nearly 4 months now and been taking probiotics for 2 months and nothing seems to be working. Anyone experience anything similar or have any advice? I’m desperate!",1571602737.0,0.5,8

"[Routine Help] My skin changed so much, not sure what to do...","Hi.  
In the past 3 years, I have been struggling with acne and have tried different things until I found something that was kind of working. Recently I have travelled for +1 month to South Asia and then South-East Asia and because of the humidity and the high temperature, I have based my skincare on washing my face with a cleanser and applying moisturiser. I have been drinking insane amounts of water and a week into my trip, my skin was clear, plump and with a healthy glow. I am back home now, things are looking pretty good, with an odd small spot here and there, but nothing major as before. I am now looking to clear my face of acne scars and smoothen the texture, but I am not sure what to do in relation to my skincare as I am scared of using anything again as right now my skin is at its best, but also I am worried that if I don't use the products that helped me, I will go back to acne.

\- ELF Hello Hydration Face Cream  
\- (Altruist 50SPF Suncream - but not as much now. I know! :( )  
\- NYX Honey Dew Me Up (make-up primer)

"using neutrogena alcohol free toner for years, seeking replacement for added moisture [routine help]","My face skin is thin, sensitive, and very prone to dryness. If it gets wet in the shower, it dries out and even gets flaky. This is with warm, not hot water, just running down my face somewhat. I've just been using toner and unscented moisturizer on it for years with okay results. There is still some dryness I feel like might be improved with a more moisturizing, still gentle toner, if I can find it. So far, I've just wasted my money. I have used witch hazel in multiple variations, as well as non-natural brands, and it all does bad things to my skin. This toner is good, but it does create massive shine (not oily just weird) and some dryness, usually on my forehead. 

Even when I did OCM, I seem to have broken the moisture barrier on my skin as it created many crinkly dehydration lines while somehow also leaving my skin feeling weirdly greasy and tight. I guess because it is so thin and sensitive, it can't handle much of anything without reacting negatively and usually those fun dehydration lines that cannot be resolved with moisturizer or oil. For years, I was doing fun experiments with various wipes, toners, cleansers, etc, and it all fucked my skin up worse. Reaching out here in case someone has similar issues and another toner worked better than mine.

I've been using Salicylic Acid for more than two months now, every day, and I haven't seen any noticeable changes in my blackheads. I've seen that it's more recommendable to use an AHA with this BHA in order to remove the blackheads, but depending on what ingredients you put together your skin can have a bad reaction to it. So I wonder if you would advise me to add any specific product to my routine, and if so, should I use it the same day I use Salicylic Acid or maybe alternate days (one day the BHA and the other day AHA).

[Skin Concern] [Personal] Girlfriend lost it after she saw my neurotermatitis feet,"Hello Reddit,

I have neurodermatitis on my hands and feet. It’s much worse on my feet tho (see picture), although it really only comes out during winter but usually some cortisone creme fixes it. 

When my girlfriend (of 2+ years) saw my feet today, she completely lost it. 

She is really deep in the whole skincare thing and easily spends thousands on beauty products, cremes and what not. Her daily routine consists of 15 cremes, sprays, oils and anything else that allows you to smear on your body. 

I am fine with all that, I even pay for some of her products, lotion her entire body up every day (which obviously is a mutually beneficial thing since of course I love touching her, so I’m not complaining about that) and to be fair, she does looks damn near flawless. However I don’t use any cremes & stuff. I barely manage to put sunscreen on my face every now and then. 

Anyway, back to topic:
She told me my feet look disgusting and DANGEROUS (she literally said “dangerous”) and that I need a pedicure IMMEDIATELY(!) because according to her it looks like my foot is about to “fall off”. 

I think this is her skincare craze speaking and that she is overreacting. I have had this condition for 28 years and I’m fine, I never died from having dry skin. 

So please be honest: Do I really need a 60€ pedicure and is my life really in danger or should I just put creme on it like I did the past 28 years?


TLDR; Girlfriend sees my life in danger because I have dry skin, I think she’s a bit overreacting.

UV photos were taken before and 8 hours after application, which reveal that most of the protection is gone at the end of the day. The attached picture is the most optimistic result from this article.

[Acne] $70 worth of Amazon gift cards - what should I buy?,"I participated in a survey and received $70 in Amazon gift cards. Now the question is: what skincare products should I buy?

They're usually cystic in nature and pretty painful. Nothing I do seems to help (I change pillow cases, try not picking, use salicylic acid, use benzoyl peroxide (not at the same time as the acid), moisturize, use sunscreen, and use a new face cloth each time).

Routine:

AM:

* Splash face with water
* Use either benzoyl peroxide or clean and clear salicylic acid acid astringent
* Unscented lotion + body shop shea butter
* Cerave AM for sunscreen

PM:

* Coconut oil for makeup removal
* Clean and Clear salicylic acid again
* Sometimes the Ordinary's Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

[Skin Concern] I think I messed up by trying Cetaphil and now everything I use makes my face burn.,"So it’s exam season and also beginning to get cold here in Canada, which means my skin has started to break out. I usually get a few pimples between my eyebrows, near my hairline and under my bottom lip. I work at a pharmacy, and one of my pharmacists there recommended that I try a gentle cleanser, namely Cetaphil. 

I gave it a go before bed, but about 15 minutes later I noticed my face felt very dry and VERY itchy. Checked in the mirror, and my face was red and covered in hives, and I got a small semi-circle of pimples and super dry skin under my eyes. Stopped using the cleanser, but the dry spots and some of the pimples remain. 

Now, when I use my moisturizer (Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gel) or my usual cleanser (Aveeno Ultra-Calming Facial Cleanser) it burns like HELL. I stopped using my toner as well, L’Oreal Witch Hazel Toner, because it just hurts too badly. 

Also to be noted: about 4 weeks ago I was a dummy and decided to try a whole bunch of new products in a new routine without patch testing and also introduced them all at once. Something was making my skin very bumpy and red, so I’ve quit all of them and have only been using the products listed above for 2 weeks now until I tried Cetaphil 4 days ago. 
The products I tried were: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Essence, Sephora Vitamin C+E Serum, and LaNeige Sleeping Mask. 

[TLDR]: Started using a whole load of products all at once, something was irritating so stopped. Tried Cetaphil facial cleanser, dried up my skin and gave me terrible pimples that won’t go away and now my regular facial wash and moisturizer burns my face. 

Can anybody suggest a way to fix this?",1571540139.0,1.0,10

[Skin Concern] Oily scalp,"Looking for advice. 

29, male.

I've been shaving my head daily for over a year with no issues. I started shaving my head as my hair began to thin and I didn't want to cling to it, so I generally have a pretty decent regrowth by the next day. But I don't generally get any irritation or anything of major concern from shaving.

The thing that drives me nuts is the amount of oil that my scalp seems to produce as the day progresses. It's not a huge or ridiculous amount, but it's noticeable. 

On an average day I've shaved by 7am and done my skincare routine, and by after midday it it's like i've visited the [shin-o ball-o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVrbq8TtTo0). Generally when I'm out, people are always touching my head, and it's a little anxiety inducing when they first comment on how oily it is. 

If it helps, I shave with a Gillette multi-blade, and [Somersets Original English shaving oil](https://www.shavershop.com.au/somersets/original-english-shaving-oil-35ml-005236.html). 

My for AM & PM routine is:

* Paula's Choice 2% BHA
* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% (I've only introduced it this week)
* Hada Labo hydrating lotion

Today I stopped in Sephora to ask for some skincare advice and was introduced to Peter Thomas Roths products. The skin care specialist used the following on me:

* Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Cream
* Water Drench Cleanser 
* FIRMx Peeling Gel
*  Potent-C Power Eye Cream 

My skin felt moisturized, looked cleaner and had a glow to it. However, it was way out of my budget for the 4 products. 

I also emailed The Ordinary for a recommended routine based off of my skin and pictures. Here's the list that they recommended:

* The Ordinary Squalane Cleanser
* The Ordinary Alpha Arbutin 2% + HA
* The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%
* The Ordinary “Buffet”
* The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA
*  The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5

anyways, i never get pimples and i only have a few blackheads and my skin looks really nice until i put makeup on it. 

then you can tell how dry, flakey and parched it really is. 

when i find something that’s hydrating enoigh, it ends up clogging my pores and giving me a bunch of little bumps... i never win!

right now i only use LRP hydrating cleanser, Alba Botanica emollient sunscreen, Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream and Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base as primer. 

Those are basically the products that make things any better for me but even those are not enough hydration for my dry and dehydrated skin.

Also what about vitamins and diet? I think my sebum is very thick and sticky so it gets stuck in the pore rather then coming out to spread over the skin which means my skin is both oily / congested and dry.

For background, i used to have mild to moderate acne that has left a few discolouration and pockmark type things on my cheeks, i started birth control two years ago which REALLY cleared it up. Now i only get like an occasional blackhead. My skin is light brown asian skin and oily to combination on my cheeks. My routine as of now is:

Washes: 
- Simple cleansing oil
-Avene Cleanance soap free cleanser
-Sk:n exfoliating glycolic acid wash (twice a week)

Routine: 
-Mario badescu rosewater spray
-Pyunkang Yul essence toner
-Poppy austin vitamin c and hyaluronic acid serum
-Revolution skincare 5% caffeine + hyaluronic acid under eye serum
-Saturday skin glacier water cream
-Pizbuin spf 30
-Avene eau thermale spring water spray

Masks i use regularly:
-Simple sheet masks
-Avocado melt retinol eye sleeping mask from Glow recipe

I never use retinol and vitamin c together or any mask with niacinamide in with my vitamin c serum. is there anything you all think i should change or use instead? I was wondering about caffeine as i read on paula’s choice today that caffeine actually AGES ur eyes and i was like yikes i better ask this sub what they think lmao.

"[Skin concerns] 30F, from ITALY, and an absolute skincare newbie. Trying primarily to clear yellowish skin discoloration around the mouth. Any advice or commentary is extremely appreciated.","I   am very pale with blue eyes and dark hair. My skin is prone to dryness   (especially my chin). I've never suffered from acne beyond the   occasional pimple or zit.

I am not and have never been pregnant or on BC. I have heard skin discoloration may be a result of vitamin B12 deficiency, which I am getting tested for.

[This is me](https://i.imgur.com/aaBxgSY.jpg) \- I am very sorry for the bad quality but this is the only camera I have and it's awful.

Here's what I plan to do now, to clear the discolored spots around my mouth:

Vitamin C+Arbutin serum  BIOcoaa (anti aging as well)

Melano CC Essence

niacinamide

I plan on rotating the last 2 every week. Is that foolish? Which one should I give priority to?

Sunscreen: [Eucerin](https://www.eucerin.it/prodotti/sun-protection/sun-photoaging-control-cc-creme-colorata-naturale-spf-50),   though I can't find it.  I plan on buying the anti aging fluid  (Eucerin  Sun Fluid Anti-Age FP50). Either that or Skinceuticals Ultra  Facial SPF 50+

Please feel free to  recommend me any  sunscreens that I can easily find in Italy and that  would protect me  from indoor lightening as well.

I will start on Retinol (The Ordinary or NeoStrata) soon.

Night cream: UriAge [https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/multi-action-cream](https://www.uriage.com/AA/en/products/multi-action-cream)

[Skin Concerns] What's Up With My Skin?,"I'm eight months post accutane and I'm beginning to break out again, so I'm left wondering just what is up with my skin because I never see anyone with a face that's similar.

My nose,forehead, and cheeks have large pores that when squeezed produce sebum, and are oily, red and blotchy, and by the end of the day have accumulated a layer of dead skin. They are like this no matter what I do, washing daily, not washing for months, all natural treatments, Accutane, etc. When I was younger they were much worse but have mellowed out a little since I turned twenty. 

Around my mouth is where most of my breakouts occur. Usually painful pustules that aren't just like like a red bump but are also surrounded by inflammation so that even a tiny one will cause a reddened area half an inch in diameter. 

I also have bad dandruff on my scalp and in my facial hair that is impossible to get rid of, nothing works and sometimes it becomes so itchy I bleed. Occasionally it's in my eyebrows and chest hair too. On the back of my scalp I get frequent painful bumps that weep and crust over. 


No derm has been able to difinitively give me a diagnosis. I've heard rosacea, Seb derm, adult acne, folliculitis, immune system dysfunction, staph infection... I've been on multiple routines and antibiotics with very limited results. 

Anyone on here experience similar symptoms and have been properly treated?",1571506576.0,0.67,2

[Acne] [Routine Help] Nearly 10 years with different Rx by derms and STILL struggling,"*\~ begin brief new poster intro \~*

Hi all! I've been lurking SCA for about 6 months now, and am excited to join the community. I am (out of desperation) seriously dedicated to my skin, but it is quite mad at me. I have had two dermatologists (I live in two different states) both of which are at the ""IDK, add more retinol"" stage.

I've been told I have oily skin. I've been told I have dehydrated skin. I've even be told dry skin. Anything my skin could be, I've been told I have that type.

The straw that broke the camel's back was trying to treat for dehydrated skin and SFs. I switched to a LRP Toleraine Milk Cleanser and followed [Fifty Shades of Snail's SF Routine](https://fiftyshadesofsnail.com/2015/03/28/how-to-shrink-pores-temporarily-plus-3-pore-myths/) and this combination brought me 4-7 new pimples in 2  weeks. I got scared and jumped ship. ~~My skin scars easily.~~

*\~ end brief new poster intro \~*

Current Routine (literally hasn't changed in about 4 or 5 years):

[my face a.k.a my EVIDENCE](https://imgur.com/a/TuTBQTy)

AM:

1. SkinMedica Facial Cleanser
2. Obagi ClensiDerm Salysilic Acid 2%
3. Aczone (dapsone) 7.5%
4. CeraVe AM Facial Moisturzing Lotion

PM:

1. SkinMedica Facial Cleanser
2. Retin-A Micro 0.08% (yep, I was Rxed to use this every night)
3. Vanicream Lite Lotion

&#x200B;

With this \^\^ routine, I usually get 1 or 2 pimples every 2 or 3 weeks, but I can get really bad cystic acne (and had it when I was younger, hence scars) if I switch my birth control generic (my experience was from Camilla to Heather).

My face is tight after washing in the morning. Face is red after applying aczone. I historically have sensitive skin (e.g. eczema prone in the winter, stingy sunscreens, stingy sweat, etc.). We've always had unscented detergents and soaps in the house bc of yours truly :)

**TL;DR** I am desperately looking for a routine that takes care of my skin, because I feel like I'm obliterating it at the moment and the derms have kind-of run out of options.

Thanks for reading!

[Product Question] Recommendation for thick and buttery rich face creams.,"Hey guys!

I'm on the hunt for really nice and thick and greasy and buttery rich face moisturizers. So far I've found a couple but none of them made it to my holy grail yet. I will list the ones I've liked and tested so my fellow dry/dehydrated folks can try them out.


- [Bareminerals Butter Drench](https://www.bareminerals.com/skincare/moisturizers/butter-drench-restorative-rich-cream/US78851.html) - so far this is my go to but sometimes I feel like it's not enough


- [Crème De La Mer](https://m.cremedelamer.com/product/5834/12343/moisturizers/creme-de-la-mer/moisturizer-for-dry-skin#/sku/26766) - I do love the smell. It is a little too cream cheesy. I like a cream that's more buttery and easier for skin to absorb. I'm running out of my first jar and Idk if I wanna shell out that kinda money again. 


- [Algenist Genius Sleeping Collagen](https://www.algenist.com/products/genius-sleeping-collagen) - I love everything about this cream but again that $98 price hurts


- [Cerave in the tub](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/moisturizing-cream) - It does a good job but I don't love it. I feel like it sits on my skin for far too long. And even though it is fragrance free there's an odd smell to it, I guess the blend of ingredients.

Since I changed my BC from pill to subcutaneous implant my skin refuses to be happy. Before I never had to worry in having a fixed routine, would just splash my face water, if even that, but know a full blown volcano has appeared. I was able to control most of my acne with peroxide benzoyl, but I'm still very oily and prone to acne. I also find it very hard to maintain a routine and slack very easily.

AM

The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash or glycerin soap - just waiting to finish the bottle and choose a new cleanser, I believe that this one is too stripping

99% Aloe Vera gel - use it mainly during breakouts and in the summer cause it calms my skin

COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - love it, is lightweight and usually use it as my daily moisturizer

COSRX Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap - don't really enjoy it, I think is too heavy for my oily skin, will try to use it during the winter and see if it is better

&amp;#x200B;

PM - this is were I slack more, usually I'm too lazy and don't have any facial care, I tough about changing my routine to shower in the PM instead of AM so that I am forced to take care of my skin in the night

The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash

peroxide benzoyl 10% - only use it during acne outbreaks

COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence

COSRX Hyaluronic Acid Intensive Cream - normally only use it combined with the PB

Hydrating Sheet masks when I want to chill, and The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Clay Mask when I need more than usual oil control.

My skin has always been too oily and I don't know what I can do to control it. Before COSRX moisturizer I used The Body Shop Seaweed Oil-Control Gel Cream, which wasn't really oil control for me cause I would still be shinny after 1 hour.

[Product Question] The Ordinary Ascorbyl Glucoside solution 12% making my skin oily.,"Hi guys, I tried to find a YouTube video or online review about this but nobody has been talking about this. 

My skin is combination but has been more on the drier side past few months. I needed something to brighten my under eyes and area around my mouth. I went to the ordinary store and explained everything, they recommended me Ascorbyl Glucoside 12%. I've been using it for 2 weeks. I haven't noticed any brightening yet. But it's making my skin extremely oily. 

I only use it at night because it doesn't layer well with my makeup in the morning. I've used it different ways; right after cleansing, after cleansing and exfoliating and, after cleansing, exfoliating and toning. Regardless, I wake up every morning with oil piled up on my face. This doesn't bother me as much because I wash my face right away. But it's also breaking down my makeup. Everyday I come back home, my face is very oily and my makeup is gone from the cheek and around the nose area. It even breaks down my eye makeup. At the end of the day my face looks gross and oily. I'm not even using it in the morning. 

This has never happened to me before.  Sometimes in summer my face gets shiny at the end of the day but my makeup stayed intact. Plus it's cold here in Canada rn.

This is the only new thing I've added to my skincare or makeup routine so I can't say something else is making me oily. 

My skincare routine in the morning is cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. At night it's only this serum after cleansing.

[Review] I Used St. Ives Apricot Acne Control Scrub,"I've been a member and lurker of this sub for over 2 years now. One of the first things I learned is the Apricot scrub is a big no no. It gives microscopic tears and it's HORRIBLE for your skin. 

This year, I saw more posts challenging the accepted notion of ""microscopic tears"". I also saw posts encouraging members to share their beloved skincare tricks that go against the grain. St Ives scrub was mentioned on that thread as well. As we all know here, YMMV is an important golden rule. For over 2 years, I've been afraid to try this scrub based on the memes, bad reputation, and shaming. I want better skin, not worse and we all know st ives is a bad idea, right?

So...a few days ago, I decided to try it. I just had to see the effects for myself. I have very oily combo skin. My breakouts usually consist of small cc clusters and then a couple of smaller pimples. I get them on my forehead and cheeks. This sub has helped clear my skin, but I still get break outs if I'm not consistent...or when I sleep in my makeup for a week straight repeatedly (I know! Bad me!). Anyway, I had a breakout and rough texture that was not subsiding no matter what I did. My usual tricks were not helping much. That's when I decided to try the scrub. 

The scrub is fragranced and smells nice. When I used it, I noticed how gritty it was so I used light gentle circular motions. I made sure I wasn't pressing down hard. My skin was already aggravated and I didn't want to make it worse with harsh force.  I really focused on my rough cheeks and then gave the rest of my face attention. It was surprisingly relaxing and fun. Around a minute or two I rinsed it off and omg, WOW! While rinsing, it felt sooo soft! After drying it, I kept touching it. Despite my recent bout of roughness, my face is usually very soft, but this was next level. My face did feel a bit irritated/slight stinging afterwards, but that happens with my Ole Henriksen scrub and power peel as well, so I knew it was fine. My face looked really glowy. The scrub did pop/remove the tops of a few smaller white heads I had. I applied moisturizer, rosehip oil, and then too cool for school's pumpkin sleep pack to my face and went to bed.

I kid you not, in the morning when I woke up, most of my spots were gone! The really inflamed pimples had shrunken down very small. I was shocked and upset I didn't take pictures. I didn't expect it to work. I honestly expected a horrible outcome. I use chemical exfoliation regularly and a couple times a week I use a small silicone face scrubber as a manual exfoliator with my face wash. None of that got me the result I saw with st ives. My luxe ole henriksen scrub doesn't do what I experienced with st. Ives.

I know st ives is considered bad on this sub, but if you haven't tested your own mileage, you might be missing out on something helpful. I'll probably use it once every 1-2 weeks. It works.

Edit: Apparently my sleeping in makeup comment for a week wasn't explained well. I was still doing a morning skincare routine daily/removing it. I'd just sleep in my makeup repeatedly for a week, clean in the morning, then reapply.",1571471459.0,0.86,44
[B&A] Accutane and Routine - Advice Needed!,"Hi sub,

I’m about to start Roaccutane to (hopefully) solve my acne problem and I was hoping for some product recommendations. I know that Roaccutane can have some serious effects on the skin so I want to ease these side effects as much as possible as well as enhance the treatment. The last thing I want is to suffer through months of side effects before realising that my routine is the problem!

I (19F) currently have problematic combination skin and I'm on birth control, as far as I know, my ance is not affected by hormones very much. My current routine looks like this:

**AM**

* Drunk Elephant Slaai Cleanser OR Cetaphil cleanser if my skin is feeling more oily 
* TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1% 
* Sukin Signature Facial Moisturiser 
* SPF 30

**PM**

* Neutrogena Makeup Remover Wipes
* Cetaphil Cleanser
* TO Glycolic Acid Toner
* TO Niacinamide + Zinc
* Sukin Signature Moisturiser 

I also have started using the Aztec clay healing mask as I've seen so many good reviews, only been using for two weeks but when I do my nightly routine goes cleanser, mask, moisturiser. 

I know that on Roaccutane it's not great to use harsh chemicals or exfoliators... I've never had overly sensitive skin before so this is new territory for me. I will speak to my derm at my next appointment to get his advice as well but you guys always give such helpful tips too!",1571470910.0,0.5,2

[skin concerns] Textured skin plaqued with hard solid sebums in every pore.,"[https://imgur.com/a/89yhc08](https://imgur.com/a/89yhc08)

Every little bump or pore you see on my face has these often large hard-ish solid sebums trapped inside. Sometimes I'll squeeze a solid sebum so big that I'm surprised it came out of such a small little pore and I'd stare at it in amazement. Maybe squish it a bit. Could anyone tell me what's up with my skin? I would say I have sensitive combination skin. My T-zone gets really oily during the day but my clogged pores are everywhere on my face including my cheekbones, temple, and the sides of my face too.

My Super Simple/Boring Skincare Routine:

AM:

Wash with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic face wash

Moisturize with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic moisturizer with Licochalcone

PM:

Wash with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic face wash

Moisturize with [Acne.org](https://Acne.org) basic moisturizer with Licochalcone

\--

I used to incorporate Acne.org Benzoyl Peroxide into my routine which helped me achieve 90% clear skin but with consequences of itchy red, dry, and irritated skin. I tried using oils in my moisturizer, or changing my moisturizer completely to the Cerave Tub (which I think is too heavy for me - more clogged pores) but no change. Every time I would stop BP, my acne would come back like clockwork and I felt like a slave to the company so I stopped completely. 

I tried Salicylic Acid (Stridex Red) but no improvements whatsoever, which is very odd.

I tried Urea. It only irritated my skin and made it red.

I thought it was fungal acne so I used Head n Shoulders as a face wash and Ketoconazole as a face mask. Didn't make it worse, didn't make it better. 

I just want to disclose that I hate tacky or greasy things on my face. If something doesn't absorb right away I feel really really **icky** and have to wash it off. It might have been something to do with me rubbing vaseline all over my body for fun as a little fetus when no one was looking, ugh.",1571467529.0,0.85,5
[Skin Concern] My Skin is Always Too Oily,"I made this account just to ask this. I'm really desperate. I need advice on how to control my oily skin as I'm pretty clueless. Everyday I go out my skin looks and feels greasy within the first several hours after I do my skincare. And I don't mean a subtle glow, I mean GREASY (especially my forehead and nose). This will sound gross but there have been lots of times where I'll go to itch my face and I feel the oil before I feel my skin. It's THAT thick of a layer! I'm super insecure about it so if anyone has any advice I'm all ears. Here's all the different stuff I've tried over the past 2 years:

-drink lots of water/improve my diet
 
-Exfoliating 

-It's 100% not my hair products (I have super short    hair and almost never put product in it anyway)

-Using a cleanser once a day/ twice a day/ not at all

 -multiple pore minimizing skincare products. 

-Mattifying primers and powders

-Ultra hydrating my skin with oil/thick moisturizers

-Gel/Water based Moisturizer

-Mattifying Moisturizer

-Witch hazel toner

-Facial Mist

-Hydrating Face Masks

-Using Oil blotting paper

-Not using oil blotting paper (I read somewhere they make more oil appear???)

-Tretinoin Cream

- Adapalene

-Clindamycin

The only thing I can think of that I haven't tried before is charcoal but I have no idea how safe of an ingredient that is??? I don't expect my skin to magically become dry if I find a new product or anything like that. I just don't want all of the oil covering my face so quickly/early in the day.

[Personal] Having a self-care night and triple masking. Feels good. 🤗,"For anyone interested in my actual routine (once weekly), here it is:

1. Warm shower to clean both face and body, while enjoying some nice steam to soften oils
2. Swipe some Stridex (red box) over my face and let it sit until neutralized
3. Moisturize body with CeraVe SA cream, get dressed
4. Rinse Stridex off (I have sensitive skin and there are a lot of potential irritants in there, so I don't let them linger)
5. Apply a thick layer of Aztec healing clay, activated charcoal, and diluted ACV  (my go-to mix), let sit until dry
6. Rinse clay mask off completely, pat dry, and apply manuka honey
7. After ten minutes, rinse honey off, splash on some unscented Thayers, and apply a more hydrating mask (currently trying to get through some sheet masks I was given)
8. After ten minutes, remove the final mask and apply my usual moisturizers (CeraVe mixed with a few drops of jojoba oil)

I find that this routine really helps my skin stay clear and hydrated, and by the time I remove the final mask, any redness from the clay mask has faded completely! I have combination skin (oily forehead/chin, dry nose, normal cheeks) and these products have been a huge help in clearing my adult acne.

When I was moving a few months ago, I sliced open my knuckle at the end of my pinky and it took a long time to heal. Because it was such an inconvenient spot for an injury, I kept reopening the scab when I would do basic things (reach inside my pocket, brush my hand against a wall/door). It was a pain in the ass and when it finally healed it has left a nasty dark scar. It seems more like a circulation thing as I can “rub away” the redness but the blood pools back into that knuckle.

2. Skincare routine: 

**AM:**

	◦	CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser - Normal To Oily Skin

	◦	TO Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 in winter when skin is dry

	◦	Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado as needed

	◦	DE Protini 

	◦	Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF if I’m going to be in sun more than 15 min. (I live north)

**PM:**

	◦	Banila Co Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm if I’ve worn foundation or sunscreen - will go back to Clinique TTDO when this is done, because even though I like the fragrance, it’s a little irritating around my eyes

	◦	CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser

	◦	if I use AHA/BHA or Vit C, CeraVe Moisturizing Cream - perfect for deepest, driest winter, but too heavy for the rest of the year

	◦	if no AHA/BHA or Vit C, DE Protini

**2-3 times/week, at night:**

	◦	COSRX AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner -- I figure I should exfoliate sometimes and this is the least irritating chemical exfoliant I’ve found. I'm thinking of switching to AHA only, since I don’t think I really need BHA (blemishes are rare, and always occasion for me to shout out loud, ""OMG, everyone! I've got a pimple!"").

**OR**

	◦	Timeless Vitamin C + E + Ferulic Acid  (aka hotdog water) -- only added this because the last time I got a facial, the aesthetician’s only suggestion was a Vit C serum (guess I'm hoping it will help keep hyperpigmentation at bay)

3.		Top 3 Products: 

a)  Kiehl's avocado eye cream was a game changer for the eczema around my eyes. It doesn’t migrate, it doesn’t have fragrance, and it soothes the red scaliness that rings my eyes every winter. Usually, when I get moisturizer near my eyes—even frag free—they tear up and it starts the cycle over again. The avocado eye cream does give me milia if I use it twice daily, so I try to use it only when my lids feel dry and sore. 

b) I’m one of those DE Protini junkies who keeps shelling out because it makes my skin plump and smooth.

c) Also a Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence fan. I don’t like the alcohol scent, but it dries to a matte finish, doesn’t pill under makeup, and I forget I’m wearing sunscreen. I do find it drying without a moisturizer underneath, though.

I’ve been a lurker for a while, but I’m posting now because I’m in search of a replacement fragrance-free nighttime moisturizer without peptides or niacinamide, to replace the CeraVe cream. The CeraVe is great in winter, but it’s just too heavy the rest of the year (as is Cetaphil cream). I was using the Protini every evening, but I just started using Deciem’s skincare routine app, and it shows a conflict between both the Vit C (presumably any LAA) and the AHA/BHA and the Protini. I use the app because I'm rubbish at science. The app seems to show a conflict between both actives and any peptides or niacinamide. I have used and liked Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, LRP Toleraiane Sensitive Fluide, and CeraVe PM, but all have niacinamide. Any suggestions for a nighttime moisturizer that’s lighter than CeraVe cream but free of peptides or niacinamide? I live in Canada, so no Vanicream.",1571437431.0,0.5,1

[Research] Does tretinoin increase future cancer risk?,"Hey all!

I've been doing reading on tretinoin - my derm wants me on it, but I have been wanting to research more myself first.

It seems the main thing people talk about is how it increases cell turnover and say that is a good thing - which it might be, for short term gains for your skin. But given my cursory understanding of biology, doesn't that mean you need to run through more skin cell divisions, and perhaps over time that would lead to more chances for cancer - since cancer happens when cells have split enough times that there's eventually a mistake in their reproductive cycle. Given this, isn't tretinoin just pushing you towards skin cancer in the far future much faster?

I can't find any studies pointing either way - some saying that it reduces short term cancer risk, and other people claiming it increases cancer risk in the future. I heard that there just haven't been enough people on it long enough to be able to say - but I was hoping someone on this sub would know more about this than I do.

[Review] Ivermectin (Rosiver),"This stuff is worth its (considerably expensive) weight in gold! Oh, man. Wish I'd found it YEARS earlier!

So, I've been using Rosiver (1 % Ivermectin) for about 2 weeks now for awful rosacea (redness on cheeks and nose and chin, big gross bumps, the works). Before this, I couldn't let ANYTHING touch my skin without an awful breakout of the bumps and redness. Couldn't wash with even the simplest of cleansers, couldn't moisturize with /anything/ at all (and my bank account was depleted from all the things I'd tried), and forget wearing make up to cover it up! My skin was a mess.

Fast forward two weeks using Rosiver and my skin isn't perfect but it's SO much better. And the best part? I've been able to use moisturizer (I use Clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion + on my face, and Paula's Choice Youth-Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid around the eyes and temples) and make up (It cosmetics CC+ concealer) with NO skin explosions afterwards! :D :D :D I can't even begin to describe how happy this has made me. In the evening I just wash my face with lukewarm water, but in a couple of weeks I'm going to try some Paula's Choice cleanser instead, if everything keeps going smoothly.

I don't notice any negative effects from Rosiver, and there's not much of a smell to it, maybe just the faintest whiff but it's not unpleasant. It seems that my nose is taking longer to clear than my cheeks did. And of course, the price has to be mentioned. I'm in Canada and it was $200 for a 60g tube, but you use so little that I think it ought to last at least 3 or 4 months, if not longer.

Overall, this has been absolutely worth it for me. Happiest I've been in a long time!",1571429549.0,1.0,5

[Routine Help] What are Lipo Hydroxy Acids (LHAs) and what can they do for your skin?,"In recent years, I've noticed that we've all become a lot savvier to different skincare ingredients. We are way more eager now to research what's in the products we put on our face (THANK GOD!). By now, you should know what exfoliation means, at least in broad terms. But, with so many new ingredients emerging, we're forced to step up our knowledge of skincare terminology almost every day.

The main ingredients I've noticed that people are eager to include in their regime are AHAs and BHAs. As you're probably aware, Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs) speed up cell turnover and gently exfoliate the skin without being abrasive or stripping, gently resurfacing and improving skin texture. AHAs (such as Glycolic Acid) are water-soluble, while BHAs (like Salicylic Acid) are oil-soluble, making them more effective at clearing out clogged pores.

Recently, a new acid family became increasingly popular, a family that is commonly referred to as LHAs - Lipo Hydroxy Acids (you may also see them listed on the label as capryloyl salicylic acid). The ingredient is increasingly found in creams, cleansers, toners and spot treatments thanks to its gentle exfoliating powers.

## SO WHAT ARE LHAS?

Lipohydroxy acid is a derivative of Salicylic Acid and has skin renewing, exfoliating, and acne-treating properties. Its gentleness comes from its slower cell penetration compared to Salicylic Acid, due to a higher molecular weight. LHAs are also more lipophilic than Salicylic Acid, this resulting in an individual cell-by-cell exfoliation that is associated with excellent tolerability. And while Salicylic Acid has a pH around 3, LHA’s has a PH around 5 which is much closer to the natural pH of the skin. This means it’s less harsh to the skin natural barrier and even suitable for sensitive skin. Lipo Hydroxy Acids are also a great alternative to BHAs for oily skin that is prone to sensitivity or dehydration.

As an anti-aging ingredient, the use of LHAs use has been proved to result in dermal thickening and has been found to be an excellent hyaluronic acid, collagen, and elastin booster.

It also has gentle astringent properties, making it great for those with acne-prone skin, clogged pores, or uneven skin texture. It penetrates the skin less than Salicylic Acid, with proprieties similar to those of Glycolic Acid.

## LHA PRODUCTS I LOVE

\*\*\*Disclaimer: The products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a product, and I thought I could share my experience.

I wanted to source the cleanest ingredient list as possible and to avoid products that contain drying alcohols, fragrance, and essential oils (you can't even imagine how hard it is to do this). It all came to a list of 3 products that I would personally recommend.\*\*\*

LHA was first developed by L’Oreal researchers in the 1980s, and as such, is found exclusively in L’Oreal or L’Oreal-owned skincare products.

1. **La Roche Posay - Effaclar Duo** \- Good Spot Treatment
2. **Skinceuticals - LHA Toner**
3. **Skinceuticals - LHA Cleanser**

These are the only products I found (if you can believe it) without/or with minimal nasty ingredients. I cannot understand why companies use SO MUCH ALCOHOL in products meant for Oily Skin. Overdrying is never a good choice, regardless of your skin type, so be aware. Being patented by L'Oreal, it's very hard for other companies to use LHAs. But these a good start for everyone who has Oily skin, prone to sensitivity or dehydration. Stay plump, my Oily skin warriors!",1571418001.0,0.67,2

[Sun Care] Bioderma Photoderm Max Spray SPF 50+ and Lait Famille SPF 50+ reformulated without white cast,"Bioderma has reformulated these two sunscreens without **Octocrylene, Avobenzone, and Tinosorb M** (responsible for the white cast) that are common in their other formulas. I had been hoping for exactly this but didn't know it been done until recently.

They have no white cast and they didn't feel heavy to me. They are NOT matte, but the finish ranges from very dewy at best to very shiny at worst, depending on circumstances (skin type, humidity level, how many products you're layering this on). I must say instances where I found it very shiny were very few, and most of the time I found it just very dewy, glass skin like.

Both contain **Uvinul A Plus, Homosalate, Tinosorb S, Octisalate, and Uvinul T 150**. They're alcohol-free and fragrance-free. The Lait has a slightly longer ingredients list than the Spray and contains vitamin E.

This [retailer page](https://www.easyparapharmacie.co.uk/bioderma-photoderm-max-spray-spf50-400ml.html) lists a PPD rating of 33 for the Spray but no rating is given for the Lait.

[Photoderm MAX Spray SPF 50+ 400ml](https://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/max-spray-spf-50)

**Cost:** I got the big 400ml spray bottle for 16,90€ at a French pharmacy. One spray fills about 90-95% of a 1/4 tsp so I usually just apply one spray of it over the face and neck. A 400ml bottle would give 320 doses of 1.25ml (or a 1/4 tsp). The period-after-opening symbol for the Photoderm sunscreens says 6 months, so a bottle would be enough sunscreen for twice daily applications for the face and neck for 5-6 months. That means spending just 33€ a year per person on sunscreen for just the face ! The official website only shows this new formula for the SPF 50 in the 400ml bottle, not the SPF 30 or SPF 50 in the 200ml bottle yet.

**Application:** I spray it in my hand and apply it. It goes on a bit oily on application but spreads easily and sets quickly without feeling heavy or sticky. Touching your face afterward, it'll feel moist and smooth but not greasy. You can still feel it on your face for about four hours, after which you'd want to renew the application for continued protection. I like to think that how much of it I can still feel on my skin gives me an indication of how it's breaking down over the course of time and whether I'm still being protected or not. I didn't experience pilling and didn't notice any smell. I'm careful with swiping this lightly on my under eye area with my fingertips, and don't have issues with stinging. I haven't sweated with these, so I don't know what happens if it runs down into your eyes.

**Finish:** The finish ranges from very dewy to very shiny. It is very shiny when I use it in the morning after my many steps routine that layers multiple hydrating and moisturizing products. If I reduce my routine a little or when I use it to reapply halfway throughout the day when my face is drier, it sets quickly to a very acceptable level of very dewy. I'm thinking most people with a basic routine might not find it too shiny, unless they have very oily skin maybe or are in a humid climate. The shine is pretty much on par with the Klairs Airy UV Essence. I find the spray bottle and the thin texture makes it very easy to reapply during the day (I kinda had been slacking on that with other sunscreens). It's not something you can carry around, though, but you could buy a smaller spray bottle or an airless pump to put it in your purse.

**Notes:** I had been breaking out prior to this when trying out the Purito Unscented sunscreens, and since switching to using only this Spray since a week ago my skin has cleared up and evened out and the highly dewy finish this gives me makes my skin look just glowy and healthy. It's not quite a saran wrap look, but actually gives a glass skin finish. I look better moisturized and a lot less flaky with this too (from Tretinoin and Granactive Retinoid use). Also after a week I noticed that my face finally matches the lighter skin tone on my neck and the rest of my body. My face was weirdly browner before, with a demarcation line like The Mask. I had been using AB sunscreens mostly.

[Photoderm MAX Family Milk SPF 50+ 250ml](https://www.bioderma.com/en/our-products/photoderm/max-family-milk-spf-50)

**Cost:** The new Lait formula exists only for now in this huge 250ml tube with the blue ""Famille"" label. I ordered it from a French pharmacy website for 12,99€. The 100ml tubes without the blue circle are still the old formula.

**Finish:** It is very similar in finish to the Spray. It is thicker and goes on more like a milk at first, but after you rub it in feels the same as the Spray. I used it to reapply midday yesterday, a whole 1/4 tsp of it, and then some, all over my face and neck. It was very shiny but when I checked in the mirror an hour later the finish had set to a very acceptable level of dewy. I've only had it a day so I haven't used it a lot yet.

The expiry date for the Spray is February 2022 and December 2021 for the Lait, so I'm assuming they're less than a year-old. When I checked other pharmacy websites and eBay resellers, some still listed the old formulas with Octocrylene, Avobenzone and Tinosorb M, so you have to check the ingredients list to make sure what you're getting. This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/devpq2/sun_care_psa_bioderma_photoderm_max_spray_formula/) compares the old and new formula for the spray.

Some info about me: I have medium tan South East Asian skin tone, NC 35. I used to have oily skin but don't anymore since getting into skincare and using a very hydrating routine.

My holy grail sunscreen ideally contains at least Tinosorbs, Uvinuls, and no Octinoxate, Octocrylene, Oxybenzone, alcohol or fragrance, is light and matte and cosmetically elegant. This ticks all the boxes, except for the matteness, but at least it is not horribly shiny, and is more like dewy *most* times. And if you don't mind it, you can always powder on top or use a blotting paper.

Chances are I might not like this during the summer months when it's 38°C and minimum 60% humidity every day, but after a more than a year-long search of the perfect sunscreen (I must have tried like 30 at least, maybe more) I'm ready to settle on these for the rest of the year. I hadn't found anything from the French pharmacy that had the best formula *and* finish, but this new Bioderma Spray version is the best compromise for high reliable European protection, clean formula and daily wear, along with being excellent value (and likely reducing waste) !

This makes a great sunscreen for daily use while keeping higher PPD but alcohol-containing sunscreens like La Roche Posay Shaka Fluid for beach/sport days and hikes. Plus the big bottle vs little bottle thing.

I hope they reformulate their other sunscreens similarly, like the Aquafluid, most particularly the tinted versions. I like to use the Golden one for when I like a little coverage on the days when I may need it.",1571417003.0,0.87,16
[Routine Help] Onexton seemed to stop working. What else can I try?,"I am pretty sure that my Onexton (Clindamycin Phosphate + Benzoyl Peroxide) cream has stopped working, as it seems to be doing nothing at preventing new pimples. I seem to get 2-4 every month, and when they finally heal, new ones pop up. I’ve had 3 on my forehead since last Thursday, and one just popped up on a cheek that was finally looking clear. I’ve been using it since October of last year, even though it says to use it within 12 weeks or by the expiration date. Costs 20 dollars each and didn’t feel like wasting it, so.. What are my alternatives? Do I try another topical antibiotic with Benzoyl Peroxide? I thought the Benzoyl Peroxide was supposed to prevent the bacteria from becoming resistant to the Clindamycin Phosphate. 

I have also been using Tretinoin 0.8/0.1% gel since October as well, which has helped a ton, but the increase I think has made my forehead in particular really dry even with moisturizer. Used CeraVe Cream in the same time frame which seemed to help but has been tingling recently due to my irritated forehead, so I switched to Vanicream’s Gentle Moisturizing Cream, been using that for a week and we will see how it goes. I wish I just had clear skin and could stop giving a shit if only my pimples didn’t take forever to clear and some of them didn’t look so inflamed.",1571416861.0,1.0,1
[Skin Concerns] What can I do about this scar on my knuckle?,"https://imgur.com/a/23Ws6C6

When I was moving a few months ago, I sliced open my knuckle at the end of my pinky and it took a long time to heal. Because it was such an inconvenient spot for an injury, I kept reopening the scab when I would do basic things (reach inside my pocket, brush my hand against a wall/door). It was a pain in the ass and when it finally healed it has left a nasty dark scar. It seems more like a circulation thing as I can “rub away” the redness but the blood pools back into that knuckle. What can I do to reduce the prominence of this scar?


I also have a similar, smaller scar on my middle finger knuckle which, coincidentally, also came from when I was moving.

[Anti-Aging]34M Need help building a routine,"This me: [https://i.imgur.com/oKQc0jU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/oKQc0jU.jpg)

Every time I come to this sub, I have grand intentions of starting a routine. I take my cup of coffee and read through the wiki and start tabbing out products to research. Eventually, I hit critical mass, get overwhelmed and find something else to do. Thought I would turn over a new leaf with a post and own my country-boy ignorance :)

I have sensitive dry skin that occasionally gets red, splotchy and flaky. Not loving this and it would be pretty cool if I could make that not happen anymore.

Grew up with bad acne but that has subsided with age. I would like to reduce this further and possibly reduce scars (not shown well in my photo).

Overall, I want to get a head start on aging rather than starting the fight after I see more blatant signs. I think my skin... tone(?) could be improved as well. Eye cream? Firming serum? BHA? 

As an example, for finding a moisturizer, occlusives, humectants, and emollients all look valuable so how do you pick? 

Right now, I use  Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid during my nightly shower. I then use coconut oil as my ""moisturizer"" in the AM and PM. Yeah, that's it.I know I need SPF but don't know if there is a certain brand that I should use.

I’ve been a bit ill and on bed rest of late so skincare hasn’t been a priority. I’m just starting to feel better and I’m dreaming of an at home spa style treatment to get my skin beautiful again - it needs some serious tlc as I haven’t had the strength even to moisturise or exfoliate for weeks. 

I still won’t be able to scrub with a loofah or body brush, but I was wondering what chemical body peel treatments there are for at home use? I don’t even know if that’s quite what I’m looking for.

[Personal] Patch test products people!,"All right. I have been using cerave moisturizer for YEARS. It was for sensitive skin, non comedogenic. I went on a backpacking trip for a month and became duly frustrated with my skin routines, and aside from moisturizer and sunscreen (and washing my face at night) I gave up on every thing.

My skin freaked. I was getting large cystic eruptions all over my cheeks, painful with no end in sight. At this point I was so emotionally done with dealing with acne. I got back from my trip and all I was doing was putting sunscreen on and washing it off at the end of the day. That's it.

Well it's been about 3 weeks of that...and my skin is almost clear. I have some PIH that's still fading but no new break outs. It seems my skin does not like Cerave, and the sad part is I have been using it since 2014.

[Acne] Purging with chemical exfoliants,"I’ve struggled with my acne for about ten years now. It used to be on my forehead at first, years later cleared up and travelled down to my cheeks. The past couple of months my cheeks have gotten a bit better, however they weren’t as clear as I’d like them to be. After seeing a lot of people talking about it online I finally decided to buy Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA liquid exfoliant. I’ve been using it for three weeks now, but I’ve noticed that on one side of my face my cheek has started to break out like crazy all of a sudden and the other cheek has been getting better. I know my skin responds well to salicylic acid, because I’ve used it before and it worked well. So I was surprised my face started to break out. I am moisturising well so I doubt my skin is dehydrated.

I was wondering if what I’m experiencing on one side of my face can be considered as purging. And if I can expect it to get better if I continue using the exfoliant for over a month. Does anyone have an idea?",1571412877.0,1.0,1

Sometimes it was painful and other times I had difficulty looking people in the eye knowing how bad I looked. Fortunately, no one really bullied me apart from a few jabs but still I felt terrible. My parents did eventually take me to a derm but after the consultation when it was time to go to the pharmacy to get products my mom said she'd only get the cheapest thing (a micellar water for acne-prone skin) which of course didn't do anything. I sensed her attitude and decided if they weren't gonna help me I'd do it on my own. Enter going online for info (where I fell for the 'dermatologist bad' scam as a 15yo), using a 'saint ives apricot' type of scrub DAILY, alcohol based toners, I steamed my pores a couple times too.

[Routine Help] Retinol Vs. Bakuchiol + Product Recommendations,"# What is Bakuchiol?

Having a long history in Ancient Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, Bakuchiol has been part of the skincare world for ages. You can find the skin-loving ingredient in the plant Psoralea corylifolia. Its Bachi seeds are packed with antioxidants and are known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Bakuchiol acts as a phytochemical that has demonstrated antiageing effects when applied topically, working similarly as Retinol, without the side effects. 

# What's the difference between Bakuchiol and Retinol?

Bakuchiol and Retinol show similar gene expression in the skin, so they both up-regulate the production of collagen and elastin. They both help with reducing fine lines and wrinkles, fading scars and hyperpigmentation, and boosting cell renewal. Probably the most notable difference between the two is that while Retinol can be irritating and cause redness, dryness, peeling, and sun sensitivity, Bakuchiol is not. Bakuchiol is promising as a more sustainable alternative to Retinol and is generally tolerated better. Moreover, Bakuchiol does not cause photosensitivity, so it's safe to use even during the day. Modern science is backing the ingredient, too. [A study by the British Journal of Dermatology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29947134) demonstrates that Bakuchiol is comparable with Retinol in its ability to improve photoaging. Moreover, Bakuchiol and Retinol both significantly decreased wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, with no statistical difference between the two. The only difference is that Retinol users did report more facial skin irritation and stinging.

# Who will benefit the most from Bakuchiol?

Almost all skin types can benefit from the use of Bakuchiol. The ingredient is ideal for anyone who cannot tolerate Retinol, such as those with sensitive skin or rosacea, or anyone who is looking for a non-irritating, natural ingredient with anti-aging benefits. The antioxidant-rich ingredient is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, making it great for those with oily, acne-prone skin, and congested pores.

# Bakuchiol products that I personally love

\*\*\*Disclaimer: The products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a product, and I thought I could share my experience. 

I wanted to source the cleanest ingredient list as possible and to avoid products that contain drying alcohols, fragrance, and essential oils (you can't even imagine how hard it is to do this). It all came to a list of 3 products that I would personally recommend.\*\*\*

1. **Best overall (in my opinion):** *Bybi Beauty 1% Bakuchiol Booster*. First of all, this is 12 British Pounds (\~15-16$ so great price point) and contains only two ingredients: 1% Bakuchiol and 99% Squalane. I assume nobody will have a problem using this, not even the most sensitive skin unless you have a particular allergy to one of these two ingredients. 
2. **Awesome ingredient formula:** *AO Skincare RAW NURTURE PM TREATMENT.* This nighttime treatment is an antioxidant and nutrient-rich that hydrates and stimulates collagen production. It's formulated with peptides, fatty acids, and cell-renewal ingredients. The dynamic active is Bakuchiol, and also contains humectants such as Red Algae, Lactic Acid, and Honey to attract moisture and hydrate the skin. The Harakeke Seed Oil and Totarol are powerful antioxidants that literally ""feed"" your face and protect against environmental damage. The Kiwi Seed Oil improves elasticity and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The treatment also contains Vitamin C and Bearberry Leaf Extract to brighten your complexion and reduce photodamage. The Olive Leaf Extract is an oxygenating agent and is good enough to penetrate even thicker layers of skin to provide long-lasting moisture.
3. **Clean Ingredient List:** *Herbivore Bakuchiol Retinol Alternative Smoothing Serum.* I really like that this contains PHAs which I personally love, and provide a very gentle exfoliation while hydrating. It has Tremella mushroom to boost the skin-refining effects of Bakuchiol and works very well for hydration. 

I know there are some popular Bakuchiol serums such as Glow Cycle™ Retin-ALT Power Serum by Ole Henriksen but I will never go near the thing because FRAGRANCE is listed in the upper part of the ingredient list. Plus it contains other ingredients that I personally find sensitizing. 

The other popular one is the SQUALANE + PHYTO-RETINOL SERUM by Biossance. This one contains Essential Oils, and not just any essential oil but Citrus Aurantium Amara (Bitter Orange) Peel Oil. This oil is way too strong to ever touch your face (it's used to treat cellulite so you can imagine how disruptive it is for the skin natural barrier of your face). Many people reported irritation after using this including swollen eyes or strong reactions. 

This small ""article"" was to encourage people to try natural alternatives to Retinol without fear. I know how confusing it is to find good products in today's oversaturated market, but if you have any other questions, I'm here to help.",1571399547.0,0.63,7

"[Skin Concerns] Im going camping and am worried about my skin, need tips :)","Sorry in advance for the waffle haha

I’m going to the jungle to camp and hike around with school we had two options an easier one where we only camped for 1 night and got provided food and water and went on trails or the one I'm doing where you don’t have any of that and camp for the full 5 nights we have to bring all our food and water with us, we don’t even have access to toilets which is one thing I'm really not looking forward to (also its part of my countries equivalent of duke of ed it looks great on a CV ;))

My skin has only recently cleared up after years of problems as I've found something that actually works for my skin which is fantastic. But I'm worried that this camp might trigger old problems and take a while to go away. My friend who has skin that can withstand anything without getting a single spot says I should use antibacterial wipes on my face which doesn’t sound like such a good idea for me as my skin is quite sensitive and very prone to breakouts and this might give me a rash - which I don't really want to risk haha.

I won’t have much access to clean water so I'm not sure how well i’ll be able to wash my face. Im going to try and bring my spin brush (if I'm allowed) to hopefully do something and a moisturiser. I have school formal a week after this and don’t want to have bad skin for it. I don’t have much space to pack my whole routine and I'm worried that missing a couple steps might make my skin upset.

Any tips would be appreciated, thanks!",1571392512.0,1.0,6

[Acne] Cystic Acne Product Recommendations,"Product recommendations for Cystic acne

Hi! 

I get pretty bad cystic acne and have for about the past 7/8 years. I think it is probably hormonal and have tried most medications (apart from accutane) and many many products.

Does anyone have any recommendations that have really helped them? The only think I have ever found really help is the Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Mask. Recently used the Cosrx Low PH cleanser and it has broken me out pretty badly in milia/whiteheads as well as made cystic acne flair up. Stopped using it and hoping it will now subside but could do with some recommendations. 

Thanks!

[Misc] Can drinking Gatorade help hydrate your skin?,"Honestly this feels like a dumb question but I was curious because I know that gatorade is supposed to keep you hydrated.

I try to drink a lot of water, but I'm just not getting enough I think. Would drinking some gatorade help with this dehydration?

[Skin Concern] Help with dehydrated skin,"So my skin is dehydrated, oily, acne prone.
I been on differin for the past three months, but have seen no progress at all so will be stopping use. I concluded that my acne must be from my dehydrated skin. Skin is oily all the time, but when I cleanse, skin gets extremely dry ( no matter how gentle the cleanser is) 

My current routine is:
AM:
Cleanse with water and then moisturize 
PM:
Cleanse with Vanicream gentle cleanser and then apply HA acid, then moisturize 

I’ve been using the ordinary Natural moisturizing factors, but feel that it isn’t moisturizing enough. 
I’ve been considering either Dr. Jart Ceramidin Cream or Stratia liquid gold. Which one should I get, or should I get both? Layer? I am also thinking about continuing using TO NMF for AM since it leaves my skin matte and that way save my other moisturizer for PM? Any thoughts on this?

[PSA] Minocycline is the devil,"By some miracle I didn’t have to wait 3 months to get in to see a dermatologist. I called and they had a cancellation! Amazing, right?

So I go to my appointment, she prescribed azelaic acid, tretinoin, and minocycline. I had never been on minocycline, only doxycycline. The derm said to watch out for headaches and dizziness. I said okay and left. 

The headaches were more like migraines with aura for me which was NOT good. I couldn’t focus my eyes, I lost my balance, there was so much pressure on the back of my neck at the base of my skull. I went online and found the list of side effects as well as did some research on Reddit about other users’ experiences. I realized this antibiotic was not for me after 6 days. 

On the 5th day I started getting a little sick. I had a cough and some body aches. Found out that’s a side effect. Day 6 was the last day I took it. I couldn’t focus while driving and I couldn’t look down without pain. Said fuck this I’m not taking it. 

Day 7 was last night. I didn’t take it. I felt some itchiness around my mouth but figured it wasn’t a big deal since I have sensitive skin and was probably breaking out. Before bed I could feel a pimple coming so my anxiety kicked in and I tried to pick at it. It started throbbing like crazy. I put some honey on it and covered it with a bandaid.

My lip was FUCKED this morning when I woke up. Turns out, this little pimple was a massive cold sore outbreak. Mind you, I haven’t had a cold sore in 10 years. The last time I had one it was tiny and in the middle of my lip. I had mono at the time. Never had another one. 

I started freaking out. This antibiotic weakened my immune system enough to make me break out in cold sores. I had to call the derm and tell her what happened and had to pick up these horse pill antivirals and some doxycycline. I am so upset. 

I’m not mad at her, I’m mad at my body. I’m mad that an antibiotic that comes with serious (however supposedly uncommon) is even ALLOWED TO BE PRESCRIBED. All because I wanted my skin to be clear. Well joke’s on me. No more cystic acne, but instead a giant explosion of pain and weeping that will probably scar because my skin is garbage and scars so easily. 

Anyway! My point is, if you have a sensitive system, don’t take minocycline. If you have any underlying illnesses, conditions, autoimmune whatever anything, don’t take this. I have some autoimmune liver thing I now need to check on too. If you need any more info message me! 

TLDR: Minocycline weakens your immune system which caused a cold sore outbreak for me (after 10 years without one). Stay away!",1571372807.0,0.4,8

When I take a shower (I've tried both cold and warm) I sometimes end up getting a strange red pattern accross my forehead, nose and cheek. This becomes pretty intense, and fades after 2-3 hours. I only used to get it on my forehead, but it's been spreading or something over the past few months.

I've also noticed that I sometimes get these pimple like spots in these areas, except they get extremely itchy and become white (not puss) in the centre, and red around the outside - almost like when you bitten by an insect or something.

[Personal] Is my dermatologist giving me BAD advice?,"*I will be linking to the products that I was prescribed because I don't live in the USA and maybe you wont know them by name. Links are in spanish sorry*

Male, 20

I've never had a skincare routine. Thank god I have been blessed with good skin genetics but lately I've been having some problems and even without those problems I think it is time to take my grooming more seriously.

My main problem issue right now is dry skin. I do have a small amount of pimples but it's few and they clear themselves relatively quickly.

So, today I went with a dermatologist trying to get into a new routine mainly because I was intimidated at how many steps and products were talked about here in this subreddit. At the end of the appointment I was a bit disappointed. First of all I mentioned how i had dry skin all over my body but it stopped (Except for my face) when I started drinking more water and he basically laughed at me for being naive saying that most probably didn't have any relation. Then he proceeded to watch my face and prescribe the same [face soap](https://www.medicamentosplm.com/Home/productos/alergibon_jab%C3%B3n_hipoalerg%C3%A9nico/60/101/6199/475) and the same [antibiotic](https://www.dokteronline.com/es/dalacin-t) that he gave me back when I was about 15 and my main problem was huge pimples. That seemed weird to me as I wasn't there for the pimples and I told him that I basically stopped washing my face precisely because it just left my skin way too dry to the point of cracking (If i touch my face dry skin falls off), again he just dismissed me and said it was normal. Because i have very few pimples i prefer living with those than a completely dry face. I asked him if he was going to give me something to put on after my face wash but he just said no and told me that having dry skin after washing is normal. I kept asking about the dryness and he basically just said ""yeah don't worry wash your face with the soap and use this antibiotic gel"" (As I mentioned, i have experience with those and while they help with pimples, they just leave me dry as cardboard)

I also mentioned how i had a lot of dry flakes in my hair some months ago. I went on to [r/HaircareScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/HaircareScience/) trying to get advice on a hairstyle and some people helped me with my scalp issues. They taught me about not washing everyday, using shampoos without sulfate and using a tea tree conditioner (I never used any conditioner). It did not solve it 100% through but it did improve the situation A LOT. I used to leave black shirts really gross full of flakes and now I don't see any unless I actively look for flakes in a magnified mirror. If my problem was a 10, i managed to dial it back to a 3. Well, my dermatologist basically told me that was really stupid and that I should be washing my hair everyday. He recommended a [shampoo](https://www.medihealth.net/producto-pirimed?url=pirimed) which does seem like it is made for seborrheic dermatitis (That I do believe I could have) , the problem is that it has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. I told him about how Head and Shoulders destroyed my hair and he just said yeah that's too bad but try this one. I was about to buy it but I don't have much money right now and in the short span that i have followed [r/haircarescience](https://www.reddit.com/r/haircarescience/) advice i I did notice some improvements.

I don't want to judge based on appearances but I did notice that the dermatologist is quite old and he attends mainly older people (Late 60s and up) and his office is in his house. He does have his degree. I really don't like judging based on this but i did notice it.

I know i am basically asking a bunch of unknown people from god knows where to judge a fully trained medical doctor but I really left with the feeling of dissapointment. I don't follow advice blindly, even if people in this subreddit and [r/haircarescience](https://www.reddit.com/r/haircarescience/) are not doctors I always get full explanations as to why I should do what they recommend and how things work, my doctor basically just said ""trust me on this one, no explanation""

[Skin Concerns] Could anyone please help me find a moisturizer/skincare routine to make my face less red?,"Hi there!  I'm a female, early to mid 20s, and I'm having trouble finding a skincare routine that doesn't make my face all red.  It generally is kinda red most of the time (if anyone has any advice to make it less red, please let me know!) but after applying moisturizers it gets even more red!  I've also noticed it's at its most even and calmest right after I wash my face (doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold) and before I moisturize it.  It also looks extremely calm and smooth after I use a yogurt mask (just plain yogurt on my face for 15 minutes) and before I moisturize.


Here's a link to my face: [https://imgur.com/a/zWJl2Fl] (https://imgur.com/a/zWJl2Fl)

And here's the products I've been using in my routine:

SheaMoisture African Black Soap

Neutrogena Hydro Boost Exfoliating Cleanser (once a week)
Yogurt as a mask (once a week)

The Body Shop Vitamin E Moisture Cream

Olay Daily Moisturizer SPF 15


I generally use a moisturizer as well as a moisturizing sunscreen because otherwise my face is really dry and the sunscreen dries it out even more.


Here are the other products I've tried as replacements/supplements to my routine:


Walgreens Hydrating Water Gel (store brand version of Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hydrating Water Gel) and straight Vitamin E oil mixed together--this is the one I use most often but have recently replaced with the Body Shop moisturizer because I ran out

Thayer's Rose Water Witch Hazel--makes my face very red and sometimes bumpy/irritated

Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Moisturizer

CeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 30 (used with another moisturizer)

Straight vitamin E oil on my face--it makes me break out!  It occasionally doesn't make my face as red, but not by much.  I will often mix it into any of my sunscreens or moisturizers.


All of these have made my face very red, even redder than usual!  I'm not sure why.  I eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and have had this redness whether or not I'm stressed.  I notice it the most whenever I'm out of the house and at work or school, but it's present at home, too.  I have no known allergies except a mild oral reaction to bananas, which I generally avoid.  


And the thing is my face has always been a bit too red.  I used to put foundation all over it to recolor it.  The moisturizers just make it worse.  But I really really wish I could go out in public without having to use foundation!  The pimple scars don't bother me so much, it's just the redness!


Would anyone recommend me a new moisturizer/toner/sunscreen/routine to try to help lessen and not increase the redness on my face?  Also, if anyone has any tips on making it a little smoother and evening the skin tone, to make it not as blotchy, those would be greatly appreciated!  I truly like the way my face looks after I wash it and before I use moisturizer; I just wish it could look like that all the time!


Thank you thank you THANK YOU in advance!  It would give me so much confidence!",1571360280.0,0.67,23

[ACNE] Skin is in dire need of help - worst it's ever been,"Hey guys, I need advice on my skincare routine because my **skin is the worst it's ever been**. The main reason I'm asking for help is that I've noticed a **dramatic decrease in my self-confidence** ever since my skin's been acting up.

I've never been really prone to acne but in the last couple of months, especially after the summer ended, my skin has just gotten worse. I'm not too comfortable with showing photos so I'll describe to the best of my ability. I have always had relatively large pores (apparently this is genetic) but they've become increasingly more clogged in the past few months. I currently have acne scars and some hyperpigmentation on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. I also have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads on my nose. My skin is naturally oily but is also pretty dry around the nose at the moment.

I need all the suggestions I can get to make my skin at least a little better. I used to have an elaborate skincare routine that worked (my skin was relatively clear) but it suddenly started causing breakouts, so I abandoned that routine.

**My routine as of now:**

AM: Wash face with water

PM: Burt's Bees Natural Cleanser (w/ cotton extract), Garnier Micellar Water for sensitive skin and Vaseline to moisturize before sleeping

**My previous skincare routine:**

PM: Cetaphil gentle cleanser, micellar water, Cetaphil moisturizer

Any tips on moisturizer would be great as well. I hate how my skin feels sticky in the morning and throughout the next day but I haven't been successful in finding a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts.

I've also tried a multitude of products between these two routines such as Neem Face Wash, L'oreal Clay Masks, Garnier Face masks, Aloe Vera Moisturizer (this also worked really well for a while but now I break out whenever I apply), Biore nose strips etc etc

I have combination skin but I’d say it’s more oily than dry. My t-zone being the worse off for oil, the rest of my face is fairly dry. I’ve suffered from acne from the age of 10 and thanks to my very awesome GP I managed to get rid of it all by the age of 21 when she prescribed me isotretinoin.

"[Skin Concerns] Used a hydrocolloid and now there are more bumps around the area, with inflammation & weeping...help!","A few days ago I squeezed a spot on my chin and one above my lip and put a hydrocolloid on each. The one on my chin was a bit underground (I know, I should've left it alone) and the one above my lip wasn't messy at all....I don't think any pimple juice even came out, more like a plug, but there was a definite bump. I washed and put a hydrocolloid on each. They were only on for a few hours until I took a shower. 

I don't know if this is relevant, but when I took the bandages off they were pretty ""messy"" with gunk....like, not just a gunk dot the size of each bump I'd squeezed, but with individual gunk dots all over each bandage. By the next day there were a few more ""underground"" bumps on my chin and above my lip all around the areas of the original bump, and both areas were slightly swollen. I slightly squeezed a couple and they started weeping clear/light yellowish fluid. That's continued for a couple of days and gotten worse.

I've tried putting on neosporin and a band aid, mupirocen that I have left over from a staph infection last year, and a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (Pimecrolimus) that my derm said may help with non-infected weeping. I keep it clean and do my best not to pick, but both areas are still very inflamed days later. One side of each area seems to be the most inflamed/weepy -- not the site of the original bump. I'm wondering if the hydrocolloids started pulling up some kind of infection from deep in my skin, if that makes any sense...but why would it affect an area 3x larger than the bandage itself?

"[Skin Concerns] - Uneven skintone, PIE, PIH.. possibly dehydrated? Help!!","Helpppp my skin is a mess right now. I can't tell if it is dehydrated or not. 
Right now, it has a lot of PIE, splotchyness and like a few whiteheads. I struggle with hormonal acne and unfortunately due to medications I am on and some medical conditions, I can't really take much to deal with it. 
It is fall now, and my skin looks congested, splotchy and red with PIE or maybe PIH.. not sure. MY current routine has worked for me last winter and fall... Especially my nighttime one. My skin usually looks hydrated and even when I wake up.. I will occasionally get a zit.. but my skin will still look fine. During the day... is when my skin FREAKS. As of right now, my skin feels tight under my makeup. 

Only new products I use is the sunscreen, Purito Centella Ampoule, Astral Cream Holy Snails Eldorado and IUNIK Tea tree ampoule. I patch tested them all. The Purito occassionally makes my skin sting. 

Here is a photo https://imgur.com/a/5DXA77K,

Currently my routine is : 

AM: 

1) Rinse with water. 

2) Occassionally I will use BR p50 (the sensitive skin formula) But I can't use it often else my skin freaks 

3) One layer of Kikumasamune 

4) One to two layers of Klairs Supple Prep Unscented 

5) CosRx Snail Essence 

6) One drop of IUnik Tea Tree mixed with a drop of Purito Centella ampoule. 

7) IUnik Propolis serum or Benton Snail Bee Ultimate Serum 

8) If I am feeling up for it I will add HolySnails Shark Sauce 

9) Two drops of my own mixture of oil (Tamanu, Pomogranate, Cammelia) mixed with a drop of Stratia Fortify and a drop of Holy Snails El Dorado - Occasionally I will massage with a guashua 

This is where I really load up on moisturizers here: 

10) Mizon Snail AIO black 

11) Stratia Liquid Gold 

12) A personal mixed concoction of Cerave Baby cream and La Roche Posay Cicaplast or Cicaplast Accelerateur (Occlusive) 

13) If I am wearing makeup (Which I usually am) Astral Cream. (Use to use Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, heard this was a dupe, it is not..) 

14) Current Sunscreen - Purito Centella Unscented Sunscreen. I also sometimes use Missha Flash Sunscreen. 

15) Primer 

Right now.. my skin feels tight.. like my foundation is just not sticking to my skin... 


PM: 

Basically the same except I double cleanse with a cleansing balm and Hydrating cleanser. Or if I am feeling lazy Bioderma Hydrating Micellaire and Hydrating Cleanser. 
ierums are basically the same except Scinic AIO Honey is added. 

I almost always sheet mask (like 5 times a week) after all my serums. 

I skip the Astral and as a final step I mixed Cerave Healing Ointment with my babycream or Sulwhasoo Overnight Energizing and slather it on like butter. 

In an ideal world where I hated wearing makeup, I would apply the cerave healing ointment during the day.. but.. I have tried and that doesnt work lol.

Over the summer I was diagnosed with Seborrheic dermatitis, so I had to change my whole routine to be fungal safe. I've always been oily, but recently it's been INSANE. Like, makeup gone off my forehead and nose within an hour or two of applying. (Same foundation and powder I've been using for years)

My skin is not dehydrated as far as I can tell. No redness, flaking, tightness etc. 

my current routine is

AM: 
-Rinse with warm water (mostly to remove vaseline from PM) 
-Garnier Oily skin micellar water (in green bottle)

I know I need to add a sunscreen, but I'm working on finding a fungal safe one that will work for  my skin

PM: 
-Vanicream Gentle cleanser (w/ Clarisonic 3x/week)
-Stridex (red box) 
-Sebamed Clear Face Gel
-Vaseline or CeraVe healing ointment around eyes/healing pimples etc


I'm just kind of at a loss as to what I should change/add to deal with this oil. I'm currently going through at least 5 blotting sheets per work day. I've pretty much given up on base makeup, so I just blot and powder every hour or so and end up looking super flat/cakey. 

I recently tried The Ordinary Niacinimide, and I didn't notice any difference. I think it also made me break out a bit.

[Personal] my love hate-relation with dermatologist (mostly hate),"  

**Feeling lost**

so after switching dermatologist for the third time I finally found one that listened to me (or tried) and didn’t put me on Accutane, she sent me Adapalene 0.3 and spiro 100 mg but sha gave me some weird ass advices.

**Skin background**: my hormonal acne problem started since I was 17(25 now) after trying everything people told me dove soap, sulfur soap, lemon, toothpaste ... (yes, I’m sorry for my skin) I decided that was time to see the derm. what I remember from this *first appointment* is that he immediately send me Accutane for a year, sunscreen everyday (local brand) and washing face day and night with Neutrogena salicylic acid cleanser and YES no moisturizer , as expected my skin cleared up but after a few months after I finished the treatment my hormonal acne came back EVEN WORSE. After that I *switched dermatologist for the second time* and yes again Accutane this time 4 months, stopping 1 month and continuing with other 6 months she told me to keep using the same sunscreen and Neutrogena cleanser (no moisturizer) long story short my acne came back like 10 times worse, my combined skin became dry and dehydrated and super sensitive (first perioral dermatitis rushes I’ve ever had).

after that I kind of lost faith and started my skincare journey by myself I found out about **Reddit** and I can’t say how much this community changed things for good, I started to remove make up properly, to use moisturizer and just washing my face at nights my hormonal acne was still there but at least my face was hydrated and looking healthy, after a lot of trial and error I found the triggers of my perioral dermatitis(tea tree oil and sodium lauryl sulfate) and found my worst enemy ***BUTYLENE GLYCOl*** , after almost going crazy wondering why if I was using gentle products why my skin was so itchy and I was getting so much closed comedones I switched products like crazy spent so much money until (thanks do incidecoder.cosdna,skincarisma) I made the connection to butylene glycol. Now I’ve been 3 months BG free (this was so difficult it’s almost in every product) and no more closed comedones and itchiness.

Some model friend recommended a good dermatologist who helped with her hormonal acne. **third dermatologist,** she actually listened to me didn’t put me on Accutane, she actually believed my allergy to BG, send me adapalene .3 and spiro and sent me a list of recommended products for a new routine, on the other hand she told me not to use moisturizer (I don’t know why they want to dry the hell out of my skin when it’s not even oily) I told her that I wanted to use moisturizer so she send 2 recommendations one with butylene glycol (so she didn’t take the time to check the ingredient list of her recommendations) and the other contains lactic acid (I’m pretty sure that if I’m on adapalene using other acids will irritate my skin) she told me to use moisturizer just the nights that I’m **not** using adapalene (3xweek), told me to change my beloved Vanicream gentle cleanser for an expensive avene cleanser that contains fragance ... and to use it twice a day (again ), she recommended Eucerin sun face oil control dry touch spf 50 (contains alcohol denat). I could email her telling all of this and asking for more recommendation but I lost faith again 

**ROUTINE (third week on adapelene .3) everything its butylene glycol free**

Jojoba oil. I've finally found an occlusive that doesn't break me out. Now what do I do for hydration? [Acne],"It's been a long old journey to get to this point, but I think I've finally found an occlusive that doesn't give me acne. However, as you'll all know, jojoba oil isn't moisturising, and as someone who is dehydrated with a destroyed moisture barrier, I can't just rely on jojoba.

In the past year I've tried these products, all of which broke me out:

* Sebamed clear face care gel
* Neutrogena hydroboost gel
* Muji sensitive toning water
* Superdrug simply pure hydrating serum
* Cosrx snail 92 all in one cream
* The Ordinary moisturising factors
* Squalene oil
* Argan oil
* I'm probably missing a few, but those are the ones I can recall from the top of my head.

Is there an extremely basic way of delivering moisture to my skin, or does it have to be from a product with multiple ingredients? I can't really afford to experiment with super expensive serums. Now I have an occlusive in jojoba, Is there a basic DIY way I can go about getting the moisture?

Horrible combination of oily and dry at the same time in different areas. I'm not sure what has caused these to come up all of a sudden but I imagine it's that I haven't been using any products with anything active in them lately. 

My routine has basically consisted of taking off my makeup with bioderma sebium, sometimes I used an Avene gel cleanser in the morning and then any random moisturiser (I've been trying to use up Avene Clearance Expert lotion- not my favourite tbh) for under my  makeup.  Super lazy... I guess I've paid the price for it.  I don't even know what's in the Avene products. 

While my skin was good, I think I used Nip+Fab Teen Skin Pore blaster/Bioderma Sebium, various glycolic acid products alternatively (mostly Alpha H liquid gold and the Nip+Fab pads), as well as Ren Clarimatte as my moisturiser.  Quite simple but was very effective!  I've loved the Ren gel cream for a looong time now, but find it a bit expensive so I tried finding cheaper alternatives many times, unsuccessfully.  My skin was still oily enough for me to use a powder foundation as my base since the natural oils on my skin would melt it very nicely after an hour or so. 

I started watching videos and reading posts on here and found out about The Ordinary. Someone I totally missed the existence of their products 'cause I wasn't keeping up with the beauty community much. I went a bit wild and bought basically everything of theirs to try. 

I started with trying out the Niacinimide+Zinc and Buffet along with the Natural Moisturizing Factors+HA cream. My pores instantly looked better so I kept using them for maybe 3 days. My cheeks magically looked smoothed out and my makeup had honestly never looked better on my cheeks.  

Then one evening I decided to slap on the AHA+BHA Peeling solution cause I felt like I had a lot of dead skin and textured bumps on my cheeks that could do with getting rid off, and while it didn't sting or anything I think my skin wasn't too happy with it. I hadn't used acid for a long time and it may have been a bit much. It was actually fine until I next applied the serums again in the morning, and realised anything I put on my skin would sting, including BB cream, and putting on the niacinamide caused huge red blotches to appear on my skin.  Unfortunately, during these couple of days I also had to bleach my roots and my skin got even angrier from the bleachy water running over my forehead as I washed it out.  I can't remember if I did this before or after the Peeling solution. My forehead hurt like crazy whenever anything touched it at this point.. 

For 2 days my forehead was super angry, dry and tight as if it was sunburnt but without the tan. I got a  couple of new spots on my cheeks that weren't there before. Bottom half of my face just got super dry and flakey. I did my best to get it to chill out my applying the oils I have on hand - Kiehl's midnight recovery and TO Rose Hip Seed Oil. I think this has mostly helped but I still have these weird cheek zits I don't normally get. 

I've kept reapplying the Rose Hip Seed Oil as soon as my face feels dry again and keeping it on overnight as it seems to be healing the irritation really well. Even though my face looks okay now like 3/4 days later, whenever I've tried to put on a bit of either the Niacinide or Buffet serums I experience stinging on my cheeks.  My skin has never been this dry and doesn't even look oily when I put the oil under my makeup as well as BB cream. Madness.  If there's anything else I can do I would really appreciate any suggestions or advice on what products to use. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - I'm looking for help on how to heal my irritated, stinging skin after over-using active ingredients (combined Niacinamide, Buffet and chemical peel in a  short space of time.. got a bit over-excited), and advice on whether I should keep using certain TO products or not!  Should I cut it out completely for a while or keep using them in small amount despite the slight stinging on application? 

My skin is normally not sensitive at all D: First time ever I've had this kind of reaction and even quite strong acids have not  caused stinging or irritation before.",1571299526.0,0.5,8
[routine help] How did you start your routine?,"I know the title sounds vague but I am new to everything. My skincare routine was Cetaphil face wash with Cetaphil lotion. But as I started getting older, I wanted to start taking care of my skin more. I avoid makeup so being able to leave my face bare and still look good is important to me.

My questions are:
1. What made you want to start a skin care routine?
2. With the market flooded with varied products and fake reviews, how did you figure out which ones work/are worth it?
3. Is there a place to find suggestions for products targeting specific problems with reliable reviews?

Feel free to elaborate more in your responses. I'm attempting to set up my own basic routine but I'm not rich and those Sephora samples are tiny! But if I found something that truly worked, I would spend the money. I'd like to know how others navigated this minefield.

"[acne] Simpler Is Sometimes Better, Your Skin Needs a Reset (The great skin barrier!)","Just thought I'd share my experience with chronic acne and some things Ive learned along the way. It might help some people figure out what is going on with their skin.  

So starting I am a 23 year old male. I always had acne prone skin but nothing major. I would look back to when I thought my skin was bad and I always thought I only wish I had that skin from x amount of years ago. Everyone freaks about their skin depending on what their baseline is. If they have perfect skin, one pimple can ruin your psyche and confidence but its all relative to the person. In the last few years it started getting really bad. Cystic acne along my neck and jawline and on random areas along my face. It was to the point where I was a shut in and didn't want to be social at a the worst time in my college life. Acne sucks and it can take a lot away from you and only people who suffer or have suffered from it know how much it can effect you. 

I tried so many different routines and antibiotics. My skin would respond well to certain treatments but I always would gain confidence in a routine and stray away. It was exhausting adhering to all these different products and routines. It was also very stressful to always have to think about washing my face properly and being so anal about anything and everything revolving my routine. While I was trying different routines and products, I'd go on extremely restrictive diets for months on end to try to also figure out if that was the core issue. I would worry about every little thing that went into my body and attribute every new break out to a potential slip up in my diet. 

I've seen so many people on this sub swear by outlandish routines and a plethora of products and at the end of the day if that works for you keep doing it. I am not here to try to tell people that this is HOW its done or is the sole reason or way to get your skin under control. At the end of the day good skin is a result of a lot of things and a lot has to do with genetics. 

Anyway here is what I have learned and my thoughts on my years of suffering from chronic acne: 

Almost everyone gets a break out(s) here or there and the reaction is usually irrational. Everyone looks for a quick fix or a product that can save their skin or calm down whatever has popped up. I believe this mentality and response is what starts people down a viscous cycle of ruining their baseline skin. I think my chronic acne was self inflicted. I remember times of clear skin and when I got a break out I would introduce new products and over wash my face to try to stop the storm.  It always seemed like my original problem areas would be where the acne stemmed. 

The main culprit:  
I think your natural skin barrier plays a huge role in the state of your skin. (skin barrier is just the natural barrier of your skin comprised of oils). A healthy permeable intact barrier will help keep the bad stuff out and the good stuff in.  If you are introducing new products with actives and over-washing your face your skin barrier is suffering dearly.

If you ever feel like you hop out of the shower with a super tight and irritated skin thats a tell tale sign there are problems. It may feel good to come out the shower with a ""squeaky"" clean feel because it appears like you are washing the bad stuff off.  I do not think this is an ideal state for your skin. Think about it like this, if you are constantly over drying your skin and adding moisture back in you are confusing your natural ability to maintain and control your oils.

My routine and final thoughts. 

Fixing your skin problems takes time. Be patient if you have disrupted your natural ability to regulate your skin barrier  it will take time to fix itself. Adhere to a simple routine that you can maintain and want to maintain. It will save you money, time and stress keeping it simple. 

The meat and potatoes of your routine or even your entire routine should just be:

Wash your face with a non irritating wash or none at all (I know scary) then apply a gentle non comedogenic basic moisturizer. Once you have stuck to the basics for a substantial amount of time, I promise you your face will be less angry, less broken out and a lot easier to maintain. You will still get breakouts and it will be an uphill battle but stick with it. Consider when you start any new routine, drug or medication for your acne. These will all take just as much time and you will be dependent and stressed out thinking about what is working or not working. Once you have stuck to this routine and created a good baseline for your skin, then you can consider adding actives and other acne fighting products to your routine. 

My routine now:

Morning: Not a damn thing 

Night: 

Wash face with clean hands (just lukewarm water) in the shower. Dry face as soon as possible. 

Why? Transepidermal water loss... This is when water dries on the surface of your skin. In this process the moisture is pulled from the epidermis and evaporates. 

After: Cerave PM, Paulas Choice 2.5 Benzoyl Peroxide, Neutrogena Hydro Boost (In this order) 

If you have simplified your routine and adhered to it and you still have major problems, I think this is where you can start considering more aggressive treatments and potential external factors. (Allergies, hormones, Vitamin deficiencies, gut health). One thing simplifying your routine will do is eliminate all your speculations about what works or isn't working. 

End: Hopefully this helps one person fix their issues with their skin. I can say now I can go out in public and enjoy my life again. I still have scaring and hyperpigmentation I am dealing with but it is a relief to be where I am now. Of course I still get breakouts and my skin isn't perfect, but I am happier way less stressed out about everything as a whole. 

tldr: If you breakout chill out, there is no overnight fix, keep your routine simple and stick with it",1571290334.0,0.79,16

[ACNE] 27/M getting adult acne and leaving marks?,"Hey everybody,

For  the past year I've noticed I have been getting acne as an adult. When I  was a teenager I had some acne but nothing too crazy. It seemed to go  away in my late teens and every now and then I would get some in my  20's.

A few months before I turned  27 I noticed I was getting acne again and predominantly around my  temples and forehead. Even if I didnt touch the blemish it would still  leave a dark mark on my skin. At first I thought it was my diet so I  started to eliminate certain foods. I eat very healthy, exercise, drink  loads of water, sleep so-so but too be fair over the past year I have  been slightly more stressed due to moving across the world back home and  getting a job in the movie industry (which is known to stressful). I  dont eat any dairy, low sugar, wash my face with sensitive face-wash,  use aloe vera and dont eat too much greasy food.

My  skin also seems to be far more oily and sweating even slightly gets my  skin super shiny and greasy. And a lot of the pimples I do get arent the  'popable' ones just big red bumps that leave a mark.

I saw a doctor to check my hormones and he said they are normal. I've booked in with a dermatologist and I'll see what they say.

Routine

Am- cleanse with acne free BP cleanser (love it)

What I need help with: I want to add something that will help with PIH, TO niacinamide had decent results but I'm pretty sure tret did most of the work. Also CeraVe sa cream burns sometimes with TO niacinamide if I don't spread it out enough maybe cause it has some acids like lactic that doesn't want to mix. But I wanna add something like alpha arbutin or azelaic acid (heard this was good) or TO hyaluronic + b5  (heard this was also good) or vitamin c but I heard that shouldn't mix with tret and I don't know how it would fit into my morning routine cuz I don't wanna get rid of niacinamide.

Don't want to get into actives or peels as I'm already using a lot of stuff. I have really oily asian skin especially the T-zone and is not sensetive.

[Skin Concerns] I scrubbed my face for a long time to remove a mole and now I have this rash/scrape on my face. Its been 32 hrs,"I recall scrubbing a mole out when I was younger so I tried it again. I have this mole in between my eyes and it is a very unattractive feature imo so I tried removing it (It was just a skin pigmentation, no bump). Unfortunately I didn't look online or anything and just went at it. 

Used water and half the the time used soap; scrubbed pretty hard for almost an hour. 


Good news? The mole seems to be gone. Bad news? I have this rash (not sure if its exactly a rash?) Its been 32 hrs at this point. I applied some petroleum jelly on it (3 times yesterday). It feels like there is a plastic mold on my face or something like that. If I widen my forehead, it feels like my skin is being stretched. Yesterday it was a bit moist and I would describe it as being similar to flesh-y? Not really but it was a little moist, less so today.

Water, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Glycereth-26, Dimethicone, Polysorbate 60, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Sodium Hydroxide, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Fragrance, Squalane, 1-Methylhydantoin-2-Imide, Ethylhexylglycerin, Disodium EDTA, Carica Papaya (Papaya) Fruit Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Limonene, Linalool, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citral, CI 19140, CI 17200


Do you think the vitamin c concentrate is good enough? Should I be wary of some of these ingredients? I’m not educated enough yet to figure it out so would love some help! Or any other recommendations of Vitamin C products and/or how to incorporate them into my routine would be really helpful!",1571276689.0,1.0,3

FLAKE CITY PLEASE HELP[skin concern],"Hi guys, I live on the east coast it's started to switch into mid fall and my skin is really feeling the effects of it. Recently my skin has been getting really dry and flakey around my nose and my eyelids and the general area around it is red, scaly/flakey, irritated, and itchy.

"[skin concerns] red, discolored, hot skin and cystic acne??? I'm desperate for help","okay, I'm probably going to book a dermatologist appt. this week. and I'm also going to go in extreme depth but I'll give a tl;dr because I'm extremely concerned, this could be a multitude of things.

tl;dr, my face turns red, super hot, and discolored and gets cystic patches of acne for like a week and then completely goes away.

longer in depth version. my skin is sensitive, dry, and acne prone, I found a routine and products that have done absolute wonders and don't irritate it or make it worse, and I've been using these products for about half a year, some longer than that. my acne has basically gone away, the texture is smoother than I thought possible, and the complexion/redness has disappeared. it feels like a miracle. HOWEVER. (and I posted this in a daily questions thread so if it sounds familiar that's why) typically like every month or so, give or take a few weeks, my skin gets a cystic break out (it's also always clustered to one place but I also get smaller pimples all over) and it doesn't correlate at all with my period, trust me, I've looked into it, and there's no connection. along with a cystic breakout, my skin turns extremely red. my neck isn't affected at all, it starts on my chin and above my jawline. and I use the EXACT same products and routine on my neck/chest. it's red as if it's extremely flushed all over, but the worst is my cheeks. and I don't wanna say it gets ""hyperpigmented"" because that tends to stay, but, my skin also gets a few shades darker, it literally looks like I have a tan, and I definitely don't bc I either just don't go outside in the sun and if I have to I wear a hat and sunscreen because I'm transparently pale. it also gets extremely hot to the touch. my whole face feels like I have a fever, not just to the touch but just sitting here it feels super hot. and I think it's just an illusion but the texture of my skin also looks bad.

so basically 4 simultaneous symptoms, redness, discoloration, acne, and heat. it happens every month(ish) or longer, and it always goes away within a week. this episode has been going on for about 3 days so far. and I've ruled so many things out.

it's not my period. it's not the products, because this predates that, I never switch them up, been using them a long time, and also apply them to my neck (my skin also looks totally fine after my skincare routine night & day during these episodes, I can even stay up like 3 or 4 hrs after my night routine and the whole time my face looks totally normal. it only happens during the day and just gets progressively worse.) it's not my pillowcase, the detergent, shampoo, cleaning products, diet, hand soap, blankets, etc. I've ruled all of that out. for a long time I thought I was just too hot, so I kept a fan on and stayed really cooled off, but it didn't make a difference. my mom suggested it might be windburn from the fan but it was happening before that. even if I keep the central AC super low it doesn't help. (but it does get WAYYY worse when the heat is on or I'm hot) I considered the fact that it was blood pressure or high heart rate, but I ruled that out as well considering I can be very relaxed and feel my pulse and it's calm, and my face is beet red. and when this isn't happening I can be extremely anxious with a high heart rate, and look normal. like I said, it's not a sunburn either, despite looking just like one. I don't go in the sun, period. my lymph nodes aren't swollen, nothing is swollen. I have no other symptoms of anything. I do work out every day for about 40 minutes and try to walk a mile every other day, but it has no correlation to that either, it makes no difference besides a very typical slightly red cheeks and sweat that only lasts about 10-15 mins after the workout whether I'm having one of these ""episodes"" or not. I also considered the possibility of it being makeup, which would be a stretch because I go through phases of zero makeup and then just eyeliner, brows, and highlight, (no foundation, no primer) and not only is highlighter the only ""face"" makeup I ever use, but it doesn't correlate at all and I use multiple brands/formulas.

I think I said this in a question thread but the ONLY thing I can think of is that it could be rosacea and these are flair ups. but from the photos I've seen of rosacea, this doesn't look like that. I don't see any blood vessels, it's just red and tan-ish. (also I think my dad had mild rosacea but his never got better or worse) every time this happens I panic and convince myself my skin is ruined and I decide to book a dermatologist apt. but it always goes away within a week and it takes a month or longer to get in with the only good dermatologist here.

the products I use are - cerave hydrating cleanser (2xdaily and this happened long before using that) kiehl's ultra facial toner (night only and I've used it for 2 yrs)  klair's vitamin c serum (every other night only and this long predates using that) cerave AM moisturizer (2xdaily and also predates that) and in the past month I incorporated the ordinary's azelaic acid chemical exfoliater, I've used it 3 or 4 times, (typically once a week and never mixed with the serum) no negative reaction, works super well, and obviously this problem predates that. my mom has also thought it's the products, but not only have I not noticed a correlation, but this predates basically all of them, they've all helped my skin like crazy, and the last few times this happened I stopped using them and slowly reincorporated them back to test for a reaction and it made no difference. it lasted a week and went away regardless.

if you need more info I'm happy to provide, I just desperately want answers or suggestions. I'm probably going to book a dermatologist apt. tomorrow and just bring in photos. also I'll edit this post later and post a photo when I can. please let me know if anyone has any ideas of what this could be or if you've ever experienced it. anything is appreciated. (thought of one more detail, the last time this happened was in early September or late August. the time before that was like the first of August. this started again a few days ago so like October 14th)",1571273644.0,1.0,1

20 year old male

I have some pretty bad folds next to my mouth, and scarring/rough looking skin around my mouth and cheeks, from acne and shaving I presume. Also forehead lines which seem to be developing.

What can I do to make these go away and even out my skin/complexion overall?

My current regime is using st ives apricot scrub, sacylic acid clean and clear essentials (rub on face using a cotton swab), neutrogena hydroboost moisturizer or cetaphil facial moisturizer.

I use tretinoin 0.05% gel most nights but have taken a break from it for the past 2 weeks as rhe side effects were getting too much.

I avoid being out in the sun for long periods and avoid using soap as par my dermatologist’s recommendation to avoid acne and drying out my skin.

[acne] Clearing cystic acne,"Hello everyone, I have a lot of trouble with cystic acne on my chin, and I recently tried a routine that actually worked for me! 

I’ve tried so many things in the past, but the only thing that every really worked was just waiting it out. Super frustrating, especially the self-restraint to not even touch it.

Yesterday I noticed another cyst forming, and started preparing myself to deal with a second chin growing out of my face for a week. However, I decided to try something different in hopes of shrinking the bump. When I woke up this morning, the bump was nearly gone!! I am so thrilled, I decided to post here for the first time! Here’s the routine I used, and I hope it’s successful for any of you too:

1. Washed my face with belif aqua bomb jelly cleanser, using my pmd clean Smart Facial Cleansing Device (I’ve had this little scrubber about 3 months, and really noticed a reduction in general congestion)
2. Exfoliated with the pmd Personal Microderm Device (I’ve only used this a couple times because I’m scared of scraping off too much, but I’ll definitely be incorporating it into my routine about once every 2 weeks from now on)
3. Put a few drops of tea tree oil mixed into water on a cotton pad, and rubbed it on the cystic acne
4. Rubbed in a few drops of Sunday Riley UFO Acne Treatment Face Oil (my skin is already oily, so this is what I use as a moisturizer when it’s hot, like it still is in Southern California) using the back side of the pmd Smart Facial Cleansing Device
5. Applied an acne sticker (I use Avarelle because they’re like $5 on amazon, but I think any kind would work) 
6. Went to bed, and woke up to normal-sized chin!

Honestly, I was so surprised it worked. This is almost life changing for me. The acne isn’t entirely gone, but it’s shrunk to such a degree that it’s not even noticeable anymore. I hope this helps anyone else who gets cystic acne!",1571266889.0,0.87,11

[Personal] A comment from my husband.,"This is my first time posting here. It's been about 1 year and 10 months now since I started my skincare journey, and about 6 weeks since the year-long breakout of cystic acne along my jaw line cleared up. I was having dinner with my husband who suddenly looked at me said ""your skin looks really clean. Like, luminous."" I can't express how much it means to hear him say that, especially since I've lately just focused on keeping my skin clear rather than messing with it with too many products in my efforts to achieve ""perfect"" skin. Just wanted to share, as someone who thought I would never get to this point.

EDIT: Adding my routine below, as many were asking.I started with skincare after hearing about the infamous Korean 10 step routine, went on a few benders and am now recovering. For the past few months, I've been trying to find more western, or European, brands to work into my routine - mostly for environmental reasons. The Asian product you see mentioned below are my HG's that I just can't find myself letting go of. My current routine is literally based on things my skin seems to like, and I'm being very cautious about adding new products as I really, really do not want to trigger another breakout.

Long story short, my skin was constantly breaking out from 2016-2018, and some of the blemishes were deep and lasted a long time. I had a cystic (I believe) pimple on my chin in 2017 that took ages and ages to heal, then got another one in the same place. It finally healed, and left a small round slightly visible shiny mark- most likely a scar, but it's been there for quite some time now and hasn't faded with any of my acids over time, nothing. It stays there while my skin breaks out on occasion and heals in other areas. It only recently occurred to me that a mark like that could possibly be something worse, even though I know in my rational mind that it was a gnarly cyst and it's most likely scar tissue. The fact that it hasn't changed at all in two years is making me less worried, actually. I was stupid and messed with it the other day, and (I apologize) some clear stuff came out and it's scabby again, but it seems as though the mark itself is still there and isn't raised or red like a normal zit, which again makes me think it's scar tissue, but I tricked myself into worrying about it.

**Texture and Smell**: 
Right away there is no strong scent to this product. Texture is pretty easy to describe as that of a light oil. This is not thick or heavy at all and is a bit runnier than some might anticipate and I find that it can easily slip and slide between my fingers as I’m massaging it into my face and it will trickle down the backs of my hands pretty fast. 
Because of this, it is very easy to spread, having a lot of ‘slip’ to it. I love this and find it perfect for extended facial massages that do not feel that I am tugging or pulling the skin in any way.
 
**Performance**: 
I’ve now gotten back into wearing makeup pretty much daily and I wear SPF 99% of the time, no matter what I am doing. Makeup can range from a very light mineral powder to liquid foundation with generous helpings of mascara on the lashes. This oil was the first one I found that actually did a number on the famous Heroine Mascara and while, lately, I have found Heroine winning once again, I can’t deny that this product does do a very good job at cleaning the bulk of it off and thus, cleaning my face well. 
In winter, I do not find I need to second cleanse with this. As I said before, it ensures there are no traces of makeup or spf left on my face and this product emulsifies and rinses off incredibly well. There is no perceptible oily residue on the skin. I say perceptible because while I can’t seem to see or feel it, I notice in Summer I do need to wash with a foaming cleanser or I am prone to a few whiteheads on my chin which could mean there is the tiniest hint of oil being left on my face which summer/high humidity me doesn’t seem to agree with? Very odd. 
I find I can get a lot of grits with this with very little pressure. This is insanely satisfying for me as it really helps me believe that this product is cleaning out my skin as deeply as it possibly can. 
Around the eyes, this is gentle and does not irritate. However, due to its slippy nature it can get between my lids and causes me a bit of blurry vision and stinging on my actual eyeball which I feel is to be expected when this happens. Don’t be like me – close your eyes tight and try not to dig your fingers all up in your lash bed and therefore all up in your eyeball.
 
**Time used**: 
I am now on my .. gosh 7th or 8th bottle of this stuff (inc refill bags as a “bottle). I’d wager the bottle lasts me roughly 3 ish months with daily use? I would also say that I am fairly generous with how much I use – almost if not 3 full pumps whereas I wager a lot of people could get by on 1.5 – 2. I think I can safely say it’s love and long term at that!
 
**Comparison of new vs old formula** 
No difference to me. Absolutely none. Everything I have written above and in my final thoughts below can be applied to both products. The only notable difference, I found on Ratzilla’s summary of it, is inclusion of more hyaluronic acid but again, I do not see anything better or worse comparing the formulas.

**Final Thoughts** 
This is an absolute holy grail product for me and you will see me recommend it often – 10/10, A+, High Distinction whatever grading rubric you prefer. I personally feel that with all the online options we have, it is available as well as being very budget friendly for cost per mL as well as how long the product actually lasts you.

[Skin Concerns] well these things popped up the day after I had an allergic reaction to peanut butter around the eyes. Is this an after affect and how can I treat it?,"https://imgur.com/a/YfVWz2m

The reaction I had was red raised patches around my eye area that were very tender. They’re still there but they aren’t as violently noticeable

update: the new reaction is a bunch of little raised dots. I took a nap, woke up and when I touched my face new ones formed under my eyes and on the bridge of my nose. They look a lot like milia

update 2: the culprit is chick-fil-a nuggets, which are cooked in peanut oil :|

[Routine Help],"Hi all! I’ve decided to revamp my routine and actually stick to it. I’m really bad at sticking to products, and im very impatient. I have sensitive, acne-prone (especially clogged pores and closed comedones) skin. I think two big issues I’ve struggled with is mild overexfoliation, but mainly switching up my products too much. So, I’ve decided to really buckle down and wait for my products to work. I was thinking this could be my new routine.

AM:
- Wash with Vanicream gentle cleanser
- Apply Cerave Eye Repair Cream
- Apply Cerave moisturizing cream
- Apply EltaMD UVClear Sunscreen

PM:
- Wash with Vanicream gentle cleanser
- Apply Cerave Eye Repair Cream
- Apply Cerave moisturizing lotion
- Apply Differin
- Apply either Cerave Moisturizing Cream or Cerave Skin Renewing Night Cream

So I had two questions to ask the community. The first was if this was an acceptable routine or not (I just really need the affirmation to not quit lol, or any suggestions y’all might have!). The second question is what your opinions are on the CeraVe products (particularly the night cream)?

[Personal] FUCK fragrance.,"I started using an “all-natural” cleanser earlier last week supposedly made with rosehip. I noticed a really strong rose smell and experienced some redness, but kept using the product as I believed it to be natural and liked the results otherwise. 

Within a week of usage I started experiencing redness and itchiness around my eyes. In hindsight I probably should have quit the facial cleanser, but I thought maybe my skin was just adjusting. 

Fast forward a couple of days and I wake up to eyelids & undereyes that are *so swelled*, I had trouble looking up or down. Had 3 “fat rolls” on each eyelid. Looked like I was a 90 year-old man. Naturally I went to a doctor’s clinic. **I had such a bad reaction, I developed blepharitis and had to be put on hydrocortisone.**

I pulled out the box from the recycling and surprise surprise, fragrance is listed as an ingredient. To make this even more ironic, this cleanser was the company’s cleanser made & marketed specially for sensitive skin. Such bullocks! 


I wish companies listed each of the ingredients that fall under fragrance. That way, people like me who find themselves allergic to some fragrance-related substances won’t have to find themselves at the doctor’s office, barely able to keep their eyes open, missing class and work. **Or even better,** I wish we didn’t have those nasty fragrances in products to begin with. This isn’t a middle school locker room. Nobody benefits from it. What’s the point?? 



Anywho, I learned my lesson: read the damn label really well, regardless of how “natural” the product & company are made out to be. Fuck.",1571255866.0,0.94,268

[Acne] 22M who recently started having forehead acne. need opinions/advice please. PICS.,"[https://imgur.com/a/MRiRg56](https://imgur.com/a/MRiRg56)

(pics span over months starting in June until now, each picture shows the breakouts at the worst point, but they would typically clear up within a week. the last picture is my current break out which has been going on since 10/7).

i've never been the one to get forehead acne, at most it would be 1-2 pimples that would go away after several days. and this would rarely ever happen. in my teen years, i had a period of breakouts that would appear on the side of my face and it was pretty bad. my most recent struggles with pimples was about 3 years ago where i had a lot of pimples under my chin, but i think that was due to shaving without shaving cream and not properly disinfecting razors. the side and under my chin acne have all gone away however.

but now ever since June, forehead acne started happening a lot more often, i would get the 1-2 pimples, they would go away after several days, but would come back about a week or two later.

this cycle has been on repeat and is still going on now, but this time currently going through my worst breakout yet as it seems like it is only getting worse.

i have never used any products before as i would just wash my face with water every night and ever morning when i wake up; however, in July, i invested in Neutroena Pore Refining Exfoliating Cleanser because i thought it would help. i have been using this every night by wetting my face, applying it on my fingers and rubbing it in circles all over my face, specifically on my forehead and letting it rest for about 10-20 seconds before i rinse it off, with little to no help.

my current breakout started last sunday on 10/6 with two pimples on my forehead. i noticed them appear the next day on 10/7 after eating In N Out the previous day (though this never was an issue i had before). now not only are the pimples still here, but more have come to my forehead as you can see in the last picture in the link.

i haven't made any lifestyle changes and my diet is still the same. there has been no drastic changes in my life that would lead to me answers why i started getting forehead acne so this is why i'm asking what people on reddit think or for any advice. i've never been to a dermatologist before but if this keeps persisting, i feel like that may be the best option.",1571252395.0,1.0,5
Can benzoyl peroxide cause wrinkles? [Acne],"I have a friend who had bad acne in her early 20s. She told me she used mainly benzoyl peroxide (along with an oral medication) to combat it.

My acne scars are increasing though so I don't know what to do. I can't really use a moisturizer because EVERY normal skin product makes me break out so bad, leading to more permanent deep acne scars.

I've been using charcoal cleanser every day but I still feel so frustrated with my acne.

[acne] Epiduo restart?,"Skin woes whilst purging

Hi!

I’m two weeks into epiduo. I have used this before and stopped completely back in June/July (thought I didn’t need it any longer) and was carrying on with my normal routine of TO lactic acid 5% & azelaic acid suspension PM and vitamin C & alpha arbitun AM, which are my staple. Have seriously transformed my skin! 

During the summer I was trialing TTO as a toner (stopped due to irritation) and TO squalene oil (stopped due to CCs).  

So to cut the long story, I have started using epiduo again & all these tiny bumps are coming to the surfaces, some as whiteheads or tiny blackheads, which I know is good but man if it isn’t rough :(.  Plus I have a wedding to go to next week & I’m not up for it at all. 

I’m really frustrated at myself for stopping the epiduo in the first place, but I thought since I already had an exfoliant I didn’t need it - I guess my skin relies heavily on the cream then I thought. Lesson learnt I suppose ...

How did you get through your purge? 

Is it normal to purge this quick?

Plus is it usually worse in our eyes than what people actually see?

[Meta] Fireside Chat Thread: Subreddit design contest and spooky stories,"Hello lovely readers of this post :)

I hope you're doing well. I'm feeling a bit under the weather, so I could use the warm blaze and comforting crackle of a nice fire today.

Which is good, because we have a wonderful little (spooky) [Fireside Chat](https://media.giphy.com/media/3NeU6RmIyJqHpTmiAQ/giphy.gif) planned!

## **Looking back: what we've done**

Let's start with a look back. A big project /u/scumteam14 and I undertook was updating the organisation of the sidebar and making the wiki easier to navigate. We realised that even though we have lots of good information, it might not be very easy to find - so we wanted to change that. We also made a change to make the sidebar more visible for mobile users - which is to add an Automod sticky comment on every post with a few helpful links.

Ideally, reddit would give us a better option for presenting information to mobile users, but at the moment we felt that this was the best option.

I'm definitely interested to know how people who frequent the sub often experience that sticky comment. I wonder if you get used to it, like it becomes background noise, or whether you find it intrusive and whether it negatively impacts your experience in ScA.

Another thing we did was add and train a new mod! /u/mastiii has been a very loyal and active ScA'er, being the only person to get a Helpful User badge three years in a row. I'm happy to report they're doing great as a mod :) We're planning to continue adding new mods - the more the merrier!

## **Let's talk: design contest**

Let's look at the (near) future! We've had our current banner for…. I think as long as the subreddit exists? At least as long as I've known it, which is fffffive years. Oh god.

Anyway, it could definitely do with an update! Same goes for the snoo (on legacy) and the subreddit icon (on redesign/mobile).

Now, we do have a moderator with great design skills on the team, /u/sunscreenpuppy, but we thought it'd be way more fun if the banner and snoo were created by the community! Because we've already seen that we have some pretty creative skincare addicts - [looking at you](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dhg9dm/misc_i_made_a_skincare_illustration_for_day_13_of/), /u/cornpopsforever!

We'd love to get your feedback on how to organise this contest, because we'd like to make something that works, that's fun for people to participate in and that's doable.

This is our general outline: first, a brainstorming thread where everyone is welcome to share ideas (whether they end up making a design or not) and where we'll include all the details. People are free to use ideas from the brainstorming thread or come up with their own. Then a feedback thread, where people who have started their designs can share them and get feedback (totally optional). Finally a voting thread - we haven't worked out what the best way is to do this yet. And of course we'll announce the winning designs and upload them to the sub!

What I'd love to know:

* What do you think about this general setup for a design contest?
* Is there anything we could do to make it better or more approachable?
* Do you have suggestions on how to do the voting in a fair way?

## **New item: User spotlight!**

We'd like to use this opportunity to celebrate some awesome users!

The first one is looong overdue. I created a form to nominate awesome users - and then promptly forgot all about it, until we re-did the sidebar organisation. Which means I completely missed that not just one, but TWO users had nominated /u/LikesGreenTea earlier this year!

/u/emsgoo and an anonymous user both took the time to fill out the form and tell the mod team how great /u/LikesGreenTea is:

>they are an avid skincareaddiction member and answer questions with good intellect on skincare. they answer so many questions and they are just AWESOME! 

> Every time I search the subreddit for a specific issue, I find a detailed thoughtful well written comment and 90% of the time it is LikesGreenTea.

/u/LikesGreenTea: thank you so much! We're giving you an Awesome User badge :) And thank you anonymous and /u/emsgoo for your nomination!

Secondly, we have two great Sunscreen Review posts that we've added to the wiki:

* [The 10 sunscreens I've tried in my HG search! In depth reviews + swatches](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/dcern5/review_the_10_sunscreens_ive_tried_in_my_hg/) by u/Ivorykiki

We really appreciate the time and effort that went into creating these helpful posts! /u/Ivorykiki and /u/caffeinatedlackey, we'll give you a Content Contributor badge to say thank you :)

Do you see anyone being awesome in the sub? [Send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSkincareAddiction&subject=&message=) and nominate them for the next User Spotlight!

## **Off topic topic: spooky stories**

/u/scumteam14 loves ghost stories, and it's almost Halloween! So share your favourite spooky stories with her in the comments :)

If you're not into ghost stories but you are celebrating Halloween, I'd love to hear how you're going to celebrate it! Are you staying home in your PJs? Sitting on the porch to scare trick-or-treaters? Working in a haunted house? Let us know!

[Skin Concern] Does your routine affect how soft your hands are?,"Does anyone else have experience with their hands feeling different after their routine?

After a few weeks of my routine, my hands feel weird. It’s like there’s a dry layer of something on them. There’s a part of my left hand that has started flaking off. I guess it’s my routine? I have to touch my face with my hands to put products on. After I’m done with my sheet mask, I pour the excess liquid into my hands and rub it into my neck, chest, and hands.

[Routine help] Tretinoin .05% (~3 months in) + continued breakouts + dryness,"I have a few questions about my current routine that I was hoping y'all would be able to assist with/or share your experience on.  I'm currently working with a dermatologist on my skin, but I'm feeling a little disheartened by the process.  Here's a bit of background/info on my current routine:

**Routine:**

1. I wash face with SkinCeuticals Simply Clean Cleanser, which is *fine,* but I don't think I'll repurchase because it just seems ungodly expensive for something fairly ... simple.  
2. Sometimes use a sulfur face wash prescribed by my dermatologist (\~3 times a week).  I don't have the slightest clue if it does *anything.*
3. Use Tretinoin .05% (sometimes I'll moisturize before and after the Tretinoin)
4. Use a moisturizer, which has been La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5 , which I love, but have a few issues with:
   1. I go through it so fucking fast, and it only comes in a tiny tube
   2. Sometimes it like cakes up in areas so that if I touch my face, some like peels off (maybe I'm using too much?)
   3. My dermatologist isn't convinced it's the best moisturizer because it's more of a balm -- she recommended La Roche Posay Lipikar Daily Repair Moisturizing Body Lotion, which I'm convinced breaks me out.  Also, it fucking STINGS when I put it on.  My dermatologist said some stinging is fine, but it just doesn't feel right (tried also, La Roche-Posay Effaclar H Compensating Moisturizer, which I'm not sure I like either)

**So, with all of that, here are my current issues:**

1. My skin chronically peels.  It's strange, because my skin doesn't feel dry, and when it does peel, it's not raw underneath --- it's almost like skin peeling on a old sunburn.  I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn't feel like liquid fire when applied (other than Cicaplast), and that doesn't leave me a peely mess by the end of the day.
2. I'm still struggling with breakouts.  They're like tiny little pimples too - nothing super big or anything, just a lot of little, little pimples.  They're driving me crazy!  I get that Tretinoin takes time, but I'm about 3 months in and I don't see any of that glowing, lovely, ageless skin.  I know it's a process and it doesn't happen over night, but I'm feeling kind of defeated that whenever it seems like for a day or so my skin is looking better, I get like three pimples the next day in the same spots over and over.

**Also, some other details (don't know if they're helpful):**

1. My dermatologist recommended the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic serum, which I unfortunately bought.  I used it for a bit and saw no real difference.  I mainly stopped because I cannot for the life of me get past the smell.  
2. I've tried Neutrogena Hydro Boost and it seemed OK, just not enough moisture, also, it was one of the moisturizers I've tried that burned like I had just tattooed my whole face.

[Routine Help] How to choose the best moisturizer for your skin type.,"When choosing a moisturizer, the first question you need to ask is: What do I need specifically, an emollient or a humectant?

**Emollients** are used to soften and smooth the scales of the skin, which help reduce rough, flaky skin. Unlike humectants that attract moisture, emollients create a guarding film in order to trap it. Emollients are typically used to protect skin cells and help regulate skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and ichthyosis by preventing scaly patches, itchiness, and flare-ups.

**Humectants** typically draw water to the skin from two different places; they can draw water from a humid environment, and they enhance water absorption from the outer layer of the skin.

**+ Occlusives**: Occlusive ingredients create a physical barrier helping to trap moisture in the skin. Moisture can’t escape very well, nor can it penetrate this barrier. Other occlusive ingredients include wax, dimethicone (or any ingredient ending in “cone”). Occlusives work in tandem with humectants and emollients to help keep the skin hydrated, soft, and glowing by preventing trans-epidermal water loss (aka TEWL.) This is achieved due to an additional barrier against the skin that locks in moisture—but it doesn’t increase it.

If you have a **Dry skin** type and you consider yourself to be hydrated, you should focus on a good emollient to lock-in the moisture in your skin barrier and prevent patches, eczema or itchiness.

If you have **any skin type** but suffer from dehydration you would need the three of them present in your moisturizer.

Some good **humectants** to look out for in a moisturizer are Beta-glucan, Yeast Extract (one-of-the-best), Aloe, Honey, Hyaluronic Acid, Glycerin, Red algae, Allantoin.

Good **Emollients** include Lanolin(best, in my opinion), Squalane, Shea butter, Cocoa Butter, Coconut Oil, any oils high in linoleic acids. I would refrain from using emollients such as Mineral oil, Petrolatum or Paraffin as they were reported to be **potentially** damaging to the skin in the long-term. It all depends on your skin reactiveness, some people love mineral oil, and some not. Pay attention to how your skin reacts to these ingredients. 

In terms of **occlusives,** most plant oils are considered emollients, but some oils, particularly those high in oleic acid, also have occlusive properties. Lecithin, and Cocoa Butter work wonders as occlusives. You can find Dimethicone as one of the preferred occlusives in most moisturizers, but some people with sensitive skin have reported reactions to it.

**A good moisturizer for water loss:** Biologique Recherche Hydravit's (excellent humectant quality and formula).

**A good moisturizer for dry skin:** Drunk Elephant Lala Retro (emollient-focused formula).

*****Disclaimer: The two products mentioned by me here are products that I actively use. I do not have any affiliation with any of these brands, nor is this post sponsored in any way. I will never recommend something that I don’t use/like. I had a very hard time choosing a moisturizer and I thought I could share my experience because I have spent some serious money on products that simply didn’t do the job.*****

Question from my wife about vitamin C serum [Product Question],"Hello, skin care enthusiasts! My wife doesn't reddit, but after looking around this seems like the best place to ask her question for her. Here goes: she is 47, already going though menopause, uses tretinoin at night, has dry skin.  One of her friends gave her a gift basket which includes a bottle and dropper thing called Maelove The Glow Mker Antioxident Serum. She wants to know if it'll make her skin even more ""yukky,"" which is ""dry and using powder shows that it's flaky too."" She says she used a different Vitamin C serum her dermatologist gave her, last year, before starting the tretenoin, and it made her face really dry then, plus now with the tretinoin she is worried.

Thank you from a guy who thinks she looks like a knock out anyway.",1571237262.0,0.9,36
[Acne][Product Question][Routine help]Jojoba oil+Witch Hazel?,Is it better to mix jojoba oil and Thayer's witch hazel toner for your face to get benefits from both products?

I also want to know the if you guys can recommend some accurate websites about these products or point out other benefits of the products that most may not know :). I still have some acne scars and also suffered from oily skin although I think it was a medication I was taking that caused the issues in the first place since I was never prone to any breakouts (unless I'm on my period).

[ROUTINE HELP] Can I use Aloe vera gel as a second cleanser after mineral oil OCM?,"My skin is prone to contact dermatitis from fragrance, lanolin. I also am prone to malasezzia (aka fungal acne). I am extremely glycerin sensitive and have dry skin so a soap cleanser is a NO-GO.

I am searching for a cleanser that is readily available to me (Canada) and has an ingredient list that won't cause my skin to go up in flames but also won't break the bank. 

I've tried Cetaphil, Neutrogena, Cerave Hydrating, Vichy, Bioderma, Eucerin, various baby shampoos, even eczema body wash..... All broke me out or left me hot and itchy.

Vanicream also costs a ton to ship to Canada and has Glycerin as one of the first 5 ingredients so NO thanks.

So far the only thing that cuts it is the Avene Gentle Cleansing lotion (got a sample from shoppers) but it's a whopping $28 Canadian dollars for under 200ml.... 

So.... what brings me to aloe gel. I remember I read someones routine on this sub and they mentioned using aloe gel as a morning cleanser? Is that even possible? I don't wear makeup but I do double cleanse to remove mineral sunscreen. Would aloe gel be a good second cleanser? How about if I use a microfibre cloth? 

TLDR; Literally every cleanser has aggravating ingredients, don't live in USA, only cleanser that works is $$$$, broke, would using aloe vera gel as a second cleanser w/ a cloth after OCM with mineral oil work?",1571235184.0,1.0,11

"[Routine Help] I recently started taking care of my skin, but need help figuring out which products to add next.","I (28F) have just recently decided to start taking care of my skin like an adult. I have lurked this sub for a while and decided my skin needed some love.

I have sensitive, combo skin in which my T zone gets oily part way through the day. I have been moderately acne prone since I was a teenager. Back then, I tried all kinds of harsh acne treatments, wore a ton of makeup, and went tanning. Over time, I stopped most of the acne products and quit tanning. I also (within the past year or so) stopped wearing makeup on my skin (only eye makeup). Although it is much better than it was, I do still have some mild skin issues I would like to straighten out.

I have some CCs, OCs, and sometimes get small pustules or papules. I also have uneven texture and some mild pigmentation from acne scars. Up until the past month or two, I generally just took my eye makeup off with micellar water and washed my face with just water (I had previously done OCM, but got lazy). I also didn't use moisturizer or sunscreen (I know).

My current routine is:

AM: Gently wash with water, mist face with rosewater, apply CeraVe Daily Moisturizing lotion, Australian Gold Botanical Tinted Sunscreen 50 SPF (just added to routine this week)

PM: OCM with hemp seed oil, swipe with Garnier micellar water for second cleanse, rinse with plain water after micellar water, swipe with Thayer's Unscented Alcohol Free Witch Hazel, mist face with rosewater, apply Cerave Daily Moisturizing lotion

Since I started my current routine, I have seen some improvement in the look and feel of my skin and it seems like everything (so far) is cooperating. I have sensitive skin and do not have experience with a lot of products, so I am only adding one step or product at a time to gauge my reaction to it. I would like some advice on what to add and which products to add first. I have seen a ton of shelfies with TO products, and I am interested in them because of the reviews and the reasonable price point. I am interested in adding the following: an exfoliant (I heard Lactic Acid is a good starter?), Vitamin C, Niacinamide, and Rose Hip Seed Oil. What do you guys think?",1571233167.0,0.66,9

[Acne] Acne caused by allergies? Any regime that will help? Starting to scar...,"Is there anything I can do for my acne caused by allergies? I start allergy shots November 25th.

[Routine Help] Sunscreen making foundation look cakey,"My skin is combination, acne prone, and I also have PIE on my cheeks and chin. I wear a zinc based sunscreen daily underneath my liquid foundation. I find that it breaks apart my makeup on my chin and around my nose. 

I notice my skin looks hydrated, smooth and generally good texture-wise when I’m not wearing makeup, but when I apply foundation it looks cakey, dry, and gets patchy. Does this happen to anyone else? 

I’m hoping a primer after sunscreen could solve this issue. I love my SPF and foundation, but together they don’t seem to work well.

I know this could be asked in a makeup sub, but I’m looking for recommendations for primers that are good for acne prone skin, affordable, and work well with zinc based sunscreen. Any additional advice is welcome! Thank you in advance :)

Serious closed comedones! I’m not sure how else to improve my routine. [Acne][Routine Help],"Hello, SCA!

I would love your help. I read thing a lot but still think I need some help. I have pretty okay skin. I have a small patch of eczema every now and again but I’m overall happy with my skin with one exception: closed comedones and hyperpigmentation. 

I have PIH and use a pretty solid routine that has improved it! My closed comedones, however, remain unchanged. I feel them right under the surface of the skin on my forehead, cheeks, chin and jaw. If I look very close, I can see them. But they aren’t glaringly obvious. 

If I’m so inclined to clear a pore, a squiggly line of pus comes out or a thicker white pus (sorry, TMI). More often or not, they’re stuck and I don’t feel like picking anyway. I think these may also be sebaceous filaments. 

My routine is as follows:

AM:
- rinse face with warm water
- tone (Benton Aloe BHA toner)
- serum (TO alpha arbutin + HA)
- moisturize (Biossance squalane + omega repair cream)
- oil (Biossance vitamin c + rose oil)
- sunscreen (Skin & Lab Fre-Sun Lotion SPF 50+ PA++++)

PM:
- double cleanse (DHC deep cleansing oil)
- cleanse (Dr. Jart dermaclear micro gel cleanser)
- tone (Benton Aloe BHA toner)
- serum (TO alpha arbutin + HA)
- moisturize (Biossance squalane + omega repair cream)
- oil (Biossance vitamin c + rose oil)

I usually use a chemical exfoliant (nip and fab glycolic instant fix extreme 5% glycolic acid) 1-2x a week but I switched for using good genes lactic acid treatment for two days and my skin became very itchy and dry. I haven’t exfoliated since then. 

I feel like my routine could be better and I’m not sure where to make the improvement for my closed comedones. I want to start getting facials, but want can I do preventatively on my own?

[SKIN CONCERNS] Face Tightness,"The front of my cheeks and sometimes my jawline are nearly always tight to some degree. Usually it is only slightly tight, but sometimes worse. The only time I notice it not being tight is right after I was it, but the tightness returns within 20 or 30 minutes.

It is like this year round so it does not seem to be a winter/summer type thing. When I touch my face the skin doesn't feel dry to the touch. I have dry skin other places and originally thought that was the problem, but my face is never flaky like my other skin is so maybe this is something different?

I have been experimenting with my routine but nothing seems to have much effect on the tightness. I tried heavier moisturizer and a sleeping masking but that had no noticeable effect. I shave my face daily so I thought that might be related, but I went a week without it and noticed no difference then either.

I am struggling with my skin lately. I am 26 y/o and have oily skin (Mediterranean and eastern european decent) and suffer from acne.

[Routine Help] I tried to do too many things at once. How do I reset my skin/routine?,"I have a habit of doing too little research and buying products that I don't test or give my face time to adapt to. Years ago when I first got into skin care, I decided that I have combination dry skin and bought Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and Cerave Facial Moisturizer. I pretty much only used those two twice a day, AM and PM, and my skin was... fine. Not great, not terrible. I wanted to fix my SF and I got blind pimples once every couple of weeks.

Recently, I decided to do something about it. I have Ponds Anti-Wrinkle Rejuveness Cream, so I started using that a couple of times a week (with sunscreen, of course). At the same time, I started wetshaving because I've been developing ingrown hairs and I needed a new razor anyway. That caused irritation and bumps, probably a combination of bad technique and bad reaction to the shaving soap. To combat that, I bought myself red box Stridex. Why? Because I decided that I actually have combination seasonal skin. So a cheap BHA like that would probably help balance my oil production and heal the razor bumps.

I've since stopped the AHA and switched to a soap that's better for sensitive skin. But now I have PIH and the razor bumps seem to be getting worse. I can't tell if they're healing or not. My routine recently:

AM:
No cleanser. I leave my house, hit the gym, shower, moisturize with Cerave Facial Moisturizer, then head to work. I do this because I don't want to cleanse/moisturize at home, work out, shower, and moisturize again. Or maybe I should do that? 

PM: 
Cerave Hydrating Cleanser
Stridex if I don't shave. If I shave, I use an alum block. 
Wait 25 min
Cerave Facial Moisturizer 

My hunch is to stop shaving and stick with a simple cleanse/moisturize daily until the razor bumps heal. And then after, I can address my PIH and SF concerns. Does that sound about right? Or is there something else I can do to bring my skin back to the ""not great, not terrible"" days?",1571184430.0,1.0,2

I’m not sure why theyre forming it could be from shaving, acne, using heavy sunscreens?

[Skin Concern] Hydrating procress is breaking me out? (desperate),"Okay, I've really had enough with my skin because there are so many things wrong with it, If I try to fix one thing, the other problem would just become a bigger threat. Nothing's working and I just want to give up. 

I am an Asian male with oily dehydrated skin. Really OIly 

 [This photo was taken 30 mins after showering](https://imgur.com/a/oq8wtXW)

I have been on acne.org  for two years now and it kept my face acne free for 93% of the time. (I guess this is where I got my dehydration from, benzoyl peroxide)

I've been trying to fix my oily skin by cleansing using oily skin cleansers,  applying oils like rosehip, jojoba using a matte moisturizer and such throughout the years but it seems that my skin is a capital of oil production.

Recently I found out that I have dehydrated skin so I began trying to fix that as well. I added in Vita B5 Toner and Cerave Hydrating moisturizer to help restore my moisture barrier on top of my Acne.org Regimen. I started breaking out, and little bumps, especially near my jawline, started coming out of nowhere, I don't know what they are, but they seem like the can grow as an acne/pimple.

So I stopped using vita b5 toner because of the breakout, Went back to my normal routine, acne.org and it cleared it again but it took two weeks or so. 

Fast forward to last week, I swapped my moisturizer to Cerave Hydrating Moisturizer, it was good for 3 days then my breakout and bumps started coming back. 

 [This is my skin now, you can see the little bumps and the breakout.](https://imgur.com/a/qJzN4PA)

Benzoyl peroxide is amazing, It's the only thing that I have tried that has kept me acne clear. However, I don't know if this is 100% correct but it's probably what caused my dehydration. I don't want to stop using it because the moment I do, I start breaking out. When I break out it leaves PIH that stays for a couple of months. Nothing works for my oily skin either, I do use a Matte moisturizer on top of my regular moisturizer but that only lasts an hour or so before the oil penetrates through it. 

I don't know if I should just keep my skin dehydrated so I don't break out or not. 

At this point, I'm convinced that every time I apply hydrating products or whenever my skin is actually hydrated, I break out.

I use the steroid cream more than ketoconazole but I notice when I use either OTC or not keto, my skin starts to flare up red to the affected areas.

Kind of a complicated issue.

When I was 16-18 I had acne and self treated it like an idiot. I used way too much benzoyl peroxide and my face was really red and dry. Didn't use a moisturizer at all.

[product question] is soy face cleanser good for oily skin ?,"I normally oil cleanse with the ordinary squaline cleanser, then cleanse with cerave. I’m out of the ordinary cleanser and catching a flight tomorrow. So i don’t have much time to get a replacement. (The Ulta close to me doesn’t carry it.)

So i went to a close by Sephora. I didn’t want to spend a lot of money and i needed something small enough to pass through TSA. I picked up the soy face cleanser. (The 15 dollar 1.6 oz size)

I have oily and acne prone skin. However, i haven’t had any issues with my usual cystic acne or major break outs in about 3 months. I changed my diet majorly, decreased stress, and that helped. My only issue now is some dark spots that are going away with glycolic acid thankfully.

[Acne] Recurring comedones on the exact same spot on face,"I had really bad acne from ages of 18 all the way to 25 up until accutane cleared everything up. It's gotten a lot better now... i'm 29 years old. The only type of acne i seem to get are comedones. These comedones always pop-up in the same spot on my face. I've pretty much memorized the recurring positions on my face. Behind both my left and right jaw. Below my mouth on my chin. two on my upper neck. two at both my left and right high cheek bones. A couple along my chin. And in the middle on both of sides of my middle jaw, two on either of side of lips below my nose, one in the middle of my left cheek.... a good portion of my comedones seem to be symmetrical as well. If certain spot on my left side gets one, the relative spot on the other side of my face seems to form as well.

I just don't understand. Why on earth do these comedians keep reappearing in the same exact spot? They start forming and i either have to pop them or they become bigger and form into a lump.... aftwards there is a dark spot left over, my skin heals. Than 5 to 6 weeks later, it happens again in the exact same spot. I don't get any comedones on new areas of my skin (thank god).

Is there anyway for me to get rid of these recurring comedones for good? These are my last obstacles to beating acne forever.",1571159700.0,1.0,2
[acne] Does anyone get hormonal acne in this spot or just reoccurring acne here in general?,"I have suffered from acne since I was 12, so this isn't something that just popped up.

I do not get cysts, they are mainly small whiteheads and closed comedones that don't tend to come to a head. Cant figure out for the life of me if this is hormonal, clogged pores or Perioral dermatitis. I do have dehydrated skin right now so all I am using is vanicream gentle cleanser, drunk elephant b-hydra, Hada Labo skin plumping gel and some squalane oil.

[skin concerns] microneedling for large pores and a more plump face,"I’m starting to see the effects of aging on my face, and it’s seriously effecting my everyday life.

But I still see huge pores around my checks/nose that weren’t as bad before and loss of volume in the mid face. I also have dark circles I can’t get rid of. Will microneedling be worth it to lessen the look of pores and maybe even plump up my skin? 

I’m considering fillers for my checks and eye area, but they’re almost the price of fat grafting and not permanent, so I don’t know what to do. Researching plastic surgeons is exhausting and confusing as is trying to figure out your skincare.

[Acne] Snail mucin making hyperpigmentation worse?,"Hi, I've been using Corsx Snail Mucin for a week but today woke up with a few CCs on my forehead and the hyperpigmentation I have seems to have got worse - more visible.

Has anyone else experienced this? Perhaps the snail mucin is drying my skin which made the pigmentation worse.

Ive had dehydrated skin before, but the last 6 weeks its been really good after swapping products. 

I'm thinking its the butylene glycol in product that might be causing the CCs as this has happened before, and I've started getting tiny comedones right under my eyes (on my dark circles) which I've never had. But also could they also be the result of the product drying me out?

[Routine Help] Is the vitamin C Causing purge? Should I stick with it? AKA WHY DOES MY CHIN HATE ME?!,"Hi everyone,

I've been tweaking my routine for a while and I'm not sure if I'm purging or just haven't found the right product yet and started to break out.

I always had naturally really clear skin, didn't have to worry about it nearly at all. Then last December BOOM break out of closed comedones and clogged pores. Full panic mode.

I had a sample of Clearly Correctiv Brightening & Smoothing Moisture Treatment that worked but I thought it was WAAAAY to expensive, went to Deciem with a product list and they helped me build a routine. This was last feb. It worked beautifully, I used the khiels serum when break outs were getting worse (normally around period). And then BOOM around 2 months ago same break out of clogged pores and closed comedones returned. The're around my chin, jawline, hairline and inner cheekbones and before anyone says, I'm super careful to remove ALL make-up.

I thought it might be over-exfoliation, so I cut down my routine to basics and gave it around 5 weeks and nothing changed, if anything I suddenly got white super-irritated white-heads. Ok cool, slowly added back other aspects of my routine but nothing helped. Used Khiels as the only active and it improved things but not 100%. After a full cycle I'm now trying TO Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% instead and MOTHER OF GOD all the fucking CC are coming out after like 2 days of use and I'm not sure if this is a break-out or a purge. Do I carry on? Do I stop?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. PLEASE HELP. I WANT MY BEAUTIFUL SMOOTH SKIN BACK.

**Skin type:** normal to SLIGHTLY more oily on nose and forehead. Not particularly sensitive.

**Routine - AM**

If showering L'oreal Pure Clay Black Wash if not Garnier Miccelar Water (green cap) and a little warm water.

TO Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%

Khiels Hydro Plump (15% Glyrcerin)

Polaar Nege Eternelle

TO SPF 30 Sun Protector with Anti Oxidants

**Routine PM**

TO Squalene cleanser, removed with Garnier Miccelar water (green cap) and a little warm water.

TO Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% (when I was using the Clearly Corrective before)

Khiel's Midnight Oil Concentrate mixed with Polaar Nege Eternelle (I used them separately before, but my skin felt and absorbed it better after I did this).

**Once a week:** (as needed, depending on how sensitive my skin is) TO AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution + Khiels Midnight Cleansing Oil.

**Other:** this are other products I have around and haven't been using as I'm trying to figure out how to balance my routine: Lacura Pixi Toner Dupe, my sking reacted well to it, felt tighter and plump in a good way. TO 100% Plant Squalene, it was meh, my skin reacts better to creamy moisturisers tbh. TO Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% was something suggested by Deciem when I started trying to reconfigure my routine... No negative reaction but didn't seem to much either.

[Skin Concerns] Why am I suddenly breaking out?,"Hi all, about three-four weeks ago my jawline on both sides broke out and the pimples are not going away. It was always normal for some pimples to appear about a week before my period, but it would be just a few of them and they would go away pretty soon until the next period. However, it is much worse now - it's sudden and the pimples hurt and itch a lot.

My only guess would be the change in weather (I live in Finland and winter is coming), but it never really happened before. I use very small amount of dairy, nothing much changed in my diet over the past months, I change my pillow sheets regularly, I am always well hydrated and the only change in my routine was that I started to use toner. I have oily skin type and also history of severe acne during my teenage years.

Does anyone have a clue why this is suddenly happening? Also any tips for better skincare routine would be appreciated!

[acne] Spiro questions,"Hello everyone! So, I got off birth control around 8 months ago. And for the last three months my skin has been breaking out again, which I expected bc every piece of information says breakouts are likely to occur at the 6 month mark. 

A month ago, I went to the derm asking for doxycycline (I’ve used it before and it worked wonders). She told me I may also benefit from spiro but I wanted to try the doxycycline first. Well I am a month in and I know sometimes it takes 2-3 months but I’m still breaking out and I’m at the end of my rope and am planning to ask for spiro tomorrow at my appt. My question is: how long did spiro take for you all to see a difference in your skin? I am hoping with the combination of doxycycline, I’m taking it for 3 mos, and spiro that my skin will start improving within the month. But I just wanted to ask I guess if that was realistic?

[Routine Help] Terrified To Go Back To Square One!,"Hi everyone! I fell down the SCA rabbit hole earlier this year hoping to do away with Proactiv. I’m 36 and still struggle with acne, and my skin is combo leaning oily and dehydrated. I typically have hormonal acne on my cheeks, jawline and now chin, which can sometimes (probably more often than not) be cystic. This is something new and I’m not sure if it’s my new routine or my age...ugh. I’m also sensitive to silicones, making moisturizer very difficult to shop for. 

I took the plunge and started revamping my routine, slowly replacing my Proactiv products with other products while still trying to address my skin issues. Then back in the beginning of July I started Differin. I’m now into month 4, and looking back on photos my skin looked so much better a year ago. For some reason, practically overnight, my face is an oil slick and I wake up to new CCs/whiteheads every single morning. I’m assuming this is due to a compromised moisture barrier. My makeup is separating halfway through the day and under my eyes looks like crepe paper when I put makeup on.

[acne] I'm dreading to try Dermatica (UK version of Curology),"Hi everyone,

I've been struggling with acne for three years now. After seeing a dermatologist last summer, I was on antibiotics and epiduo (adapalene 0.1%, benzoyl peroxide 2.5%): my skin got way better! But now that my treatment ended, my skin got worse and I got a lot of breakouts..

Since I couldn't go see another dermatologist, I've decided to give Dermatica (UK version of Curology) a try! I've been prescribed with adapalene, niacinamide & clindamycin. I'm supposed to receive my order this week but I'm really scared of purging as I heard that it's really common to happen especially when using adapalene.. Given the fact that having a few spots makes me feel so low, I can't imagine how low I'll feel when I'm going to be purging :(((

I've also ordered a few more products that I'll be trying out as I suspect I have fungal acne lol so my skin routine will more or less look like this:

AM:
- Splash my face with water
- Klair Unscented toner
- Benton Aloe Propolis soothing gel
- Purito Centella Green level safe sun

PM:
- Purito Defence Barrier pH cleanser
- Klairs unscented toner
- Dermatica (adapalene, niacinamide, clindamycin) 
- after 20 minutes, Benton Aloe Propolis soothing gel

"[Routine Help] 24 Y Nurse currently suffering from Spending all her paycheck on ""Fancy skincare"", need help with a decent routine!","Please help me, I am new to the skincare game and it has been about a good year that I started cleansing regularly. I work in a very well know hospital, and all the female nurses have the most flawless skin! I am an outcast, and I try and try to find something that works but it quite isn't it.

I just recently switched from Caudalie Vinopure line, to using Dr. Dennis Gross which has been fine for me. That's a little info about me, I have the tendency to splurge on all these ""fancy"" skin care products and run off to the ""next best thing"". I have recently noticed that I started getting very small, and oily family of blemishes around my chin area and my enlarged pores clear up and then become oily again!  

\*A little secret about me, I OVERUSE masks like nobodys business. I will probably do a clarifying mask (Caudalie), or a Charcoal Clay mask (Caudalie) about 2-4 times a week thinking that all the pores are going to come back!\*

**Skin Type:** Combo, usually on the dryer side. Main concerns are to minimize pores, and the appearance of blackheads.

**Skin care Regimen**: I've been following this same regimen for about 2 months.

**Morning**: Since I am a nurse, my mornings consists of doing absolutely nothing other than washing my face with water.

**Evening:** I start with ""Farmacy Makeup cleansing balm"" if I have any foundation. Following that, I use ""Dr. Dennis Gross Pore Perfecting Cleansing Gel"". **Toner**: [CAUDALIE](https://www.sephora.com/brand/caudalie?icid2=product_link_brand) Vinopure Natural Salicylic Acid Pore Minimizing Toner. **Mon/Tue/Wed** I use ""Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Peel"" (It's too strong for everyday). **Serum(s)**: [CAUDALIE](https://www.sephora.com/brand/caudalie?icid2=product_link_brand) Vinopure Natural Salicylic Acid Pore Minimizing Serum, and [DR.

"[Sun Care] Crumbling SPF, what am I doing wrong?","Hello, I've started dabbling in skincare around a year ago and eventually got my way around to chemical peels and along with that found out I should actually be using SPF everyday regardless of if it's cloudy or not.

Logical thing for me was to get an SPF infused primer, since I wear makeup everyday and I felt like regular SPF would be too clogging. I tried Catrice's HD Active Performance (spf 30) and NARS Smooth & Protect primer (spf 50), now the catrice one was okay but the primer action itself didn't really do anything and eventually I started slightly breaking out. Since I changed nothing else in my routine I figured it has to be the primer so I switched to NARS - been using that for almost 3 months now - still breaking out, especially around my jawline and my cheeks and under my nose.

So I thought maybe I should just get a normal SPF... So I got la roche posay dry touch gel cream (spf 50), since I've read many positive reviews but I've tried it for a few days and I just can't seem to figure it out? I do my normal skincare routine, have a breakfast and then put on the spf and start applying makeup (approx. 20 mins in between moisturizer and spf). Now, whenever I start putting the SPF on its as if it just doesn't want to get on and it sort of crumbles on my skin to the point where I feel like nothing stays on? Today after it happened I wet my face a tiny bit and worked it in but it still felt really off and I'm for sure not having a good makeup day...

For reference, my skin is combination, more to the oily side and is very acne prone (my skin was pretty clear prior to all this trial and error with SPF..)

[Skin concern],"So! 

Ever since I got acne in middle school, I never actually took the time to take care of it until sophomore year, which, in return has left a few scars on my face that are not really visible anymore.

What IS visible though is how huge my pores are, and it's such a problem. I don't know if it's because I didn't understand how to take care of my face when i was younger and let it get worse, or I was just have genetics like that. The worst form of ""acne"" I've always had was blackheads, always on the cheek area.

No matter what I do or how I do it, they always come back, same place, just as big and dark as before. I'm embarrassed by it because they're so noticeable and they stick out like small mounds. I've tried pore strips, face masks, heating my face (Which is probably my most successful method, but only for a week or 2) and I'm wondering if its due to my pores being so big.

They're visible, even about a foot and a half away. I don't know how to fix my black head problem or my pore problem, and if there is maybe a type of mask/cleanser that will help me shrink them? And any recommendations for black heads? What has helped honestly is just me going at them with a tool right out of the shower, and since sophomore year, my skin has gradually increased to where I am little more confident. I was my face with a few things, but I've never been consistent with any product. I just find something that helps with dirt on the face and use it.

"[Review] Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion - a light, hydrating lotion that helps your moisture barrier","Never done a product review before, so apologies if this isn't sufficient. But please feel free to ask questions...

So I've been on the lookout for a gel lotion for AM and PM use that can really help rebuild my moisture barrier on my cheeks due to increasing usage of retinol. Researched on this forum and on r/AsianBeauty, but all the products that I wanted to try aren't available in country (or via a legit source without costing an arm/leg on shipping). I purchased this out of impulse since I was really gearing towards a Japanese or Western product.

Atopalm is a Korean skincare brand that uses patented (or will be so?) MLE technology that supposedly mimics or help with your existing moisture barrier. I'm probably not explaining this right, so please do your googling to understand their brand better. Their Soothing Gel Lotion is  baby-friendly, and applicable on face and body. I'm not sure what the ingredients are since everything is in Korean. I read that to amplify the soothing effect, you can store this in the fridge as well. But this isn't a product that *needs* to be stored in a fridge.

**MY SKIN TYPE:** combo skin. Normal T-zone (though currently have and prone to SFs on nose and chin) and dry, sensitive cheeks. A couple of acne whenever hormonal cycle is approaching. Ancient acne blemishes, sun spots and a couple of old (now purple) broken capillaries on cheeks. No scars. Rosacea just under the nose.

**CURRENT SKINCARE ROUTINE:** (sorry, it's more elaborate than I would like as I am trying to finish a lot of products that I had purchased out of greed)

**Morning** \- wash face with water only > Inkey List BHA on nose and chin > Hada Labo Gokuyjun Hyaluronic Acid toner > Hada Labo Hydrating Essence on forehead and cheeks (I don't think it's  really doing anything to my skin, simply trying to use this up) > Sana Namerakahonpo Plumping Eye cream > The Ordinary's Squalane Oil on nose and chin > Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion > Anessa Perfect UV sunscreen mild milk

**Night** \- Shu Uemura Ultim8te cleansing oil, followed by Hada Labo Cleansing foam wash > *insert Pixi Glow Tonic once a week* \> Hada Labo Gokuyjun Hyaluronic Acid toner > Hada Labo Hydrating Essence on forehead and cheeks (I don't think it's  really doing anything to my skin, simply trying to use this up) > Sana Namerakahonpo Plumping Eye cream > *Insert The Ordinary's Retinol 0.5% in Squalane alternating nights and not using Pixi Glow Tonic* \> Atopalm Soothing Gel Lotion *(mixed in with The Ordinary's Azelaic Acid on days without Pixi Glow Tonic and TO's retinol)*

**PRODUCT THOUGHTS:** Didn't have any high hopes, but was pleasantly surprised!

**Texture and finish -** like a lotion. Most of it sinks in quite quickly like a gel. I don't use a lot of it - I would say about a US 10 cent coin amount for night time. Day time, slightly less. It has a bit of a sticky finish at first, but my skin feels sufficiently hydrated and protected when it's fully absorbed. It goes under my sunscreen and liquid foundation nicely.

**Scent -** there's a faint pleasant smell. Not overwhelming at all and it goes away rather quickly. No medicinal smell or the kind you get when you buy fragrance-free skincare products. Presumably it has fragrance and/or essential oil in it, though again I cannot confirm as I don't speak Korean.

**How my skin feels after 3 days of usage -** it feels pretty resilient! I've used it as my last step for 1 retinol night routine and 1 Pixi Glow Tonic night routine, as well as with TO's Azelaic Acid mixed into it for another night. Also used it as a morning moisturiser. No breakouts or any clogged pores on areas that I applied (forehead and cheeks). I have started even applying it down my neck/decollete as well, and will be using it as my body moisturizer when I travel. I don't find it soothing in the obvious sense - say, if I was applying an aloe vera gel - but it also could be because I don't have severe damage on my skin and I haven't stored it in the fridge.

Before stumbling upon Atopalm, the most recent moisturizers I tried are:

\- Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Hydrating Light Cream (pink tub) - nice basic hydrating cream. But my moisture barrier took longer to heal with this product than the Atopalm. It also was too heavy for my nose and chin and caused my pores to clogged up.

\- Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Acid Water gel - did not feel hydrated whatsoever, or that my moisture barrier was improving. Very strong alcohol scent.

I find that  Atopalm is equally, if not more hydrating, than these products. But Atopalm definitely made my skin feel the strongest. I'm still in the process of keeping SFs under control on my nose and chin, but I will be applying Atopalm on those areas once they are.

If you are struggling to find a light moisturizer that you can use in the AM and PM, the ingredient list is acceptable, don't mind waiting more than a few minutes for the product to dry, or looking for a moisturizer for both face and body for travelling, I would highly recommend you give this a go :)

That’s not super long when you consider how it takes 2 months between check-ins for the meds to take effect. 
But my dermatologist seemed somewhat surprised and frustrated that my skin didn’t improve as much as hoped by now and seemed to be running out of ideas...

I recently had to take a break because recent life changes (moving out and getting new jobs) created enough financial strain that I decided to temporarily stop treatment.

[ACNE] UNSOLICITED ADVICE BASED ON RECENT POSTS. Hope this helps!,"So since I've joined this sub Ive seen a crap ton of questions from people with acne. Ive also seen what appears to be a lot of mistakes in their routine.

So heres some advice no one directly asked me for, but I hope it is helpful. I would also encourage others to share their skincare secrets on this post.

1) Stick to up to 3 products for day and up to 3 products for night time. 1 cleanser, 1 acid (if you are into that), 1 serum/ moisturizer. More than that and you will likely clog your pores. I add a tea tree mask when my skin is being fussy

2) Using products that are too harsh for your skin can cause / worsen inflammation / acne.  Sometimes your acne is your skin reacting to you shooting flame throwers (multiple acids) at it. Soothing products like aloe can offer some relief.

3) You are what you eat...and drink. No matter what any derm says, its been my experience that excess sugar and fat can reek havoc on the skin. When this happens to me, I do a soup fast along with only drinking plain water, lemon water, and tea (artificial sweetner) for at least a week. I slowly add foods back after my skin has cleared up. This allows me to identify the trigger food(s) and any commonalities among them. I never really ban anything, but I do limit the triggers.

4) Supplements: Some supplements detox your body and can express in your skin via bumps. Research any supplements/ vitamins that you are taking. If they are known for causing bumps, you may need to lower your dosage for a while OR up your water intake.

5) Try supplements that are purported to improve your skin. May require some trial and error. I'm currently playing around with a supplement that is quite expensive, but so far it actually works pretty well.

6) Exercise. It just makes your body function better. I focus more intensely on exercise during my fast because I am trying to rid myself of toxins and hormonal imbalances.

7) Tea Tree oil. Periodt. Its anti-fungal.

8) If all else fails, take the money youve been spending on cream after cream and try a GOOD dermatologists.",1571109359.0,0.18,25
