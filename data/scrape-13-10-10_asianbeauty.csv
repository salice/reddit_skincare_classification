It's the season for maximum moisture! What are your best moisturizing products for dry skin and dry weather?,"In the northern hemisphere it's getting colder and drier now - I'm living in Sweden and my skin definitely is feeling the change, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. So tell me, fellow ABers, what are your go-to products for that lovely moisture? Especially for those of you with dry skin and/or living in dry climates!

For me topping the routine off with Squalane is fantastic. I have dry skin and the natural oil barrier that's absolutely essential in freezing temperatures is quickly gone with some water in the morning, so finishing with a barrier of Squalane gives me that protection back. Sure, it looks a bit shiny for a bit, but it dries in fairly quickly on me and the benefits far outweigh that little extra shine.

A shoutout to laneige water sleeping mask as well, while not the richest out there it does a good job hydrating overnight.

So how do you protect your skin? And which products failed you?",1570554400.0,1.0,15

Japanese BHA product: Meishoku Bigansui Medicated Skin Lotion,"Tentative rave: [Meishoku Bigansui Medicated Skin Lotion](https://www.meishoku.co.jp/catalogue/bigan/) ([RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/meishoku-lotion/))

TL;DR – Affordable legacy product containing salicylic acid that smells truly awful but otherwise seems pretty solid. Already repurchased. Would probably recommend, except I have little experience with chemical exfoliants and have no idea how it compares with non-AB BHA products.

    Skin type and concerns: Dry/combination, dehydrated, sometimes sensitive, sun allergy, mild hormonal acne, PIH, large pores, redness.
    
    Climate: Moderate humidity; early fall. (I live in Japan.)
   
I started looking for good chemical exfoliants in Japan this spring/summer and grew more and more discouraged. Figuring that I might as well as shell out for a trusted non-AB product, I ordered the 2% BHA Liquid from Paula’s Choice, only to find out after the fact that the Korean version (which is what’s sent over if you order the product in Japan) actually contains betaine salicylate in spite of including “salicylic acid” in the ingredients list. For AHAs I bought the (Japanese) [Tunemakers Peeling Lotion](https://www.aprilboulevard.com/product-page/tunemakers-peeling-lotion). I’m almost finished with the former and have already finished the latter. Both are extremely gentle products and honestly didn’t seem to do anything for me.

After this I was wary of trying anything that costs more than 2000 JPY without seeing rave reviews that sound real, but hardly any Japanese products are mentioned here, and Japanese reviews are usually written by people with different expectations (chemical exfoliants aren’t as much of a thing here—which of course is also why there isn’t as much of a selection).

And then I happened to notice this product at the drugstore. The classic blue bottle drew my attention, and it includes salicylic acid as an active ingredient. I looked it up and found out that it’s a legacy product with a 130-year history. For what it’s worth, [the reviews on @cosme](https://www.cosme.net/product/product_id/4474/top) are pretty good. I don’t know what percentage the salicylic acid is, but with the short list of ingredients and affordable price (about 900 JPY for 90 ml), I figured I’d give it a try.

First of all, it smells just as foul as the reviews say. I definitely prefer strange-smelling products to heavily fragranced ones, but *wow*. I’m pretty sure this is the foulest-smelling product I’ve ever used, not counting artificial fragrances that I hated. If that fragrance in the ingredients is actually masking some of the smell at all (assuming they aren’t making it smell like this on purpose), I shudder to think what it would be like without it.

(ETA that it’s a leave-on product, so you’re stuck with the smell for a while. You do kind of get used to it.)

When I started using this product, I think I had a few active pimples on my jawline. It seemed to do a good job of calming them down and eventually getting rid of them, so I started using it more frequently than I probably should (up from maybe once every three days to practically every day). I know now that this is a typical rookie mistake. My acne temporarily stopped (not notable because I often don’t have any active pimples, just PIH), and then it started up again, with a mild breakout spreading to my chin and one pimple on the marionette line area.

At first I suspected some other products I’ve been using, but I now think it may have been my skin purging from the Bigansui. I stopped using it for a while when my skin got slightly peely, and the breakout gradually stopped too. I now have one almost-done pimple on my jawline and just PIH from everything else. If anything this suggests to me that the product probably does contain a meaningful amount of salicylic acid.

I started my second bottle lately and am trying to restrain myself to stick to using it once every 2–3 days at the most. So yes I’ve already repurchased, and at this price point (and widespread availability), I probably will continue to do so, at least as long as I’m living alone and don’t have to worry about how my face smells at night. It hasn’t done much for my nose (sebaceous filaments/pore issues) yet, but I’ll keep trying.

I’m tempted to recommend this when people are asking about AB chemical exfoliants now, but the problem is that I personally don’t have much experience with chemical exfoliants and don’t know how this compares with other products. I also don’t know for sure that I was purging (though it does seem like it) and again, I don’t know what percentage the salicylic acid is. So basically I’m not informed enough to feel comfortable recommending the product. But if you live in Japan and are looking for something that’s available locally (and, importantly, don’t mind foul-smelling products), maybe you could give it a try. At least it’s cheap!

    Active ingredients: Salicylic Acid, Homosulfamine

    Other ingredients: Geraniol Denatured Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Fragrance

Best products for eliminating CCs/whiteheads in combination with tretinoin?,"I noticed there are many people in this community who use tretinoin! I’ve been using tretinoin 0.05% for years now, and I’ve noticed I still have some CCs that won’t budge unless I extract them. Even then they tend to show up again after some time. 

I recently tried CosRX AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid to see if that would get rid of the problem areas after hearing many rave about it! But during patch testing for about 3-4 weeks (not daily use) it resulted in getting two huge cystic buds that took forever to go away and left me with hyperpigmentation 😒 so I’m afraid to go that route again. I’ve read lots of great things about TO products but almost all of their products have been mentioned to help CCs so can’t seem to narrow it down.

* **Details:** 24F in Sunny California!
* **Skin:** combination but dehydrated. Little redness, dealing with sunspots/hyperpigmentation. My skin is pretty resilient and don't react poorly usually. BF tends to use some of my stuff as well so I got a couple of items for his sensitive/dehydrated/acne prone/eszema skin.

###Part A. Trip Pre-planning

A month before the trip, I basically browsed AB and SCA extensively and watched a lot of videos about AB (specially Gothamista & Beauty Within). A week before flying out, I created my master excel list with all the items I wanted to buy: [Master Excel List w/ Price](https://imgur.com/hpIGgCo).

In hindsight, I should have checked out posts about where to purchase some of my stuff besides Amazon and Sephora. It's worth checking out sites like YesStyle and retailers on eBay! Prices there might be a little lower. 

Also have pictures of the products you want so it is easier to communicate with some of the associates. Something also to keep in mind is that some products are different packaged in Korea/Japan! Eg. Laneige Refiner vs Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer, it's the same thing but named a little different for the culture differences, I believe. 

###Part B. Korea

**Places I visited:**

* Myeongdong 
* University Shopping Area
* Dongdaemun
* Busan/Nampodong Street
* Random independent stores 

I personally browsed a lot before shopping because I had some free time. I took pictures of almost all the items I wanted to get an estimate of the price. What I realized what that:

* For bigger, independent stores, like Innisfree, Etude House, Laneige, Missha -- the prices and deals for the most part are the same 
* Deals varies depending on when you visit! If you're staying for a bit of time like me, check back in a week to see what new deals they have
* Olive Young has a mix of smaller brands and big brands. I felt like the prices here were not the best. The prices also varied from store to store. 

While usually they can tell you're a foreigner, you want to let them know you want Tax Free, usually they start letting you know some deals, like B2G1 FREE (2+1 or 1+1 is a very common way of phrasing). 

There's also a lot of deals for 'bundles', such as products that work well together. It's usually slightly cheaper with a couple extra samples and masks! I went for as many of these as I could find (assuming they were products I wanted). 

Associates usually also give you a lot more freebies when you buy bundles. **Don't be afraid to ask for samples!** Even better if you can ask for a specific one, usually if they don't have something, they'll give you samples of an alternative that might do the same thing. I always ask for samples of eye creams and lotions! 

Because I felt like most of the prices were the same, I ultimately shipped in the University Shopping Area because I felt like there were slightly less tourists there and it wasn't as bombarding crowded. The associates were a lot more helpful and less pushy. 

Hold your ground and stay strong! Some of these associates definitely pointed out my weak spot (large pores lol) and tried to up sell me products stating it will shrink it. 

**--- University Shopping Area** 

I shopped from Etude House, Nature Republic, and Holika Holika here. The associates (specially Etude House) was super helpful and did not push me to buy any products. In fact, the associate at Etude House swatched lip product on his own hands so I didn't have to deal with it! In all of those 2 stores, I received a BUNCH of freebies!

**--- Myeongdong** 

Shopping here was a cluster mess because there's so many things happening at once, and tons of tourists. I suggest getting as much out of the way as possible. Many of the bigger shops have tons of locations so check those out first. 

Most of the associates here speak various languages, include English/Mandarin/Japanese! At the very least, some stores have a brochure of translated words to your language. But their vocabulary is limited and there may be word associations that are a little bit different (eg. Lotion in Asia is more like an Essence). Stick to shorter phrases like, ""Is this brightening?"" ""Is this for sensitive skin"", etc. seemed to work best for me!

In Myeongdong, I shopped from a lot of different stores & definitely had a lot of repeats to make sure I didn't miss anything I want. There is a HUGE Innisfree across from Noon. Lots of space, but I felt like it had the same stuff as any other stores, except maybe the Minamalism line? Because I visited Myeongdong first to look at some items, I felt like the stores in Myeongdong pressured you a lot more so I did end up buying some items I would have not otherwise....

Lotte Mart (town lol), it's three giant buildings and it's a giant department store. Various products, this is where you would find things like Sulwhahoo. No real opinions because I only bought a set of vitamin C tangerine here but I just couldn't stand to browse because it was PACKED. The prices weren't super high or low. 

Most stores should be TAX FREE over 30,000KRW and most will give refunds on the spot. However, specifically Etude House & Oliver Young (on top of my head) requires you to find either a booth or do it at the airport. Some stores don't allow you to bundle sales & refunds. 

**--- Dongdaemun & Busan Shopping**

My hotel was right next to Dongdaemun, and is where I browsed the bigger/independent stores to gauge the prices. After browsing the prices here against the ones in Myeongdong, I realized I should just buy some stuff here instead because there weren't as many people in these stores. 

I started shopping again once I came back from Japan, so there were a couple of new deals in some stores, so I decided to pick up a couple of more things in Busan! Most of the stores I found were in **Nampodong Street** (?). And you can also find a lot of the stores in subway stations too!

**--- All Mask Story** 

So there's a couple of these and another one that I don't really remember the name of but something that stood out to me was the discounted prices on a lot of the products. 

Eg. Laneige Sleeping Mask @ 18,000KRW instead of 28,000KRW. Which made me pretty sketched as to the prices. But since there was a Laneige and Arbitium at every corner, I decided to compare the packaging and whatnot. What I feel like/or my opinion as to why it's cheaper is that either:

1. It is old packaging and Laneige was probably trying to get rid of stock in that particular packaging
2. It ultimately came out to the same price; Arbitium would do a 2+1 deal, and when you do the math, it would come out to a similar price (bonus is that Arbitium gives samplers where as I did not receive any samplers @ All Mask Story) 

If you are specifically looking for masks, All Mask Story has great deals! On top of that, one of my favorite things was buying 'mini/samplers' from these shops to give to my friends! 

**--- ALAND**

I'm going to call this specific store out because I was going out of my way to try to find things like Corsx, Klairs, Son&Park, etc. Essentially some of the smaller/'indie'(?) brands, you are more likely to find it in ALAND! I found Isntree inside of Olive Young but it usually in an obscured spot sooo I actually didn't find it until like the fifth Olive and Young. 

###Part C. Japan

**Places I visited:**

* Don Quijote (Mega @ Shibuya, Shinjuku, Akihabra)
* @cosme stores
* Matsumoto Kiyoshi
* Misc. Health/Beauty Stores (kind of like corner stores?)

To be completely honest, I spent like most of my time digging through Don Quijote but it is amazing... and I found almost everything I was looking for somewhere inside of Don Quijote. I personally would do most of my shopping here because it has *a lot* of stuff, including great things for souvenirs. 

Prices for the most part for all the products were probably within $1 (max) of each other. It's definitely not worth going through multiple stores to get the best price because minimum for tax free in Japan is Y5,000 ($50). Also make sure you get the stamp for going through security into Japan because you won't be able to get a tax refund without it. 

Be prepared to play tetris with your products if you purchased a lot because everything will be sealed up because Japan has a policy for 'consumable/usable' products to be used in Japan.

**--- Don Quijote (DQ)**

This is like a giant Costco but more disorganized. BUT you can find almost everything here. I believe everything that is a Japanese brand in my haul pics except for Shiseido Eyelash Curler & Biore PINK Bottle (I swear, I dug through SO many stores to find these...).

They do have testers but it's extremely dirty and the associates don't really switch them out often so you'll often find things that are just empty. So it is a little bit harder to test things out. Items were grouped by category and brands. The bigger brands have their own section. Some items will require you to find an associate and pick up at the counter. The stores are REALLY cramped, so expect to bump into other people.

Honestly? I had a blast here because there were SO man things. Especially if you go to the MEGA in Shibuya. **Tip:** the one in Shibuya is 24hrs. Go at an obscured hour, eg. Jet Lagged? and go through all the items without fear!

**--- @cosme stores**

These were very nice to be in. Everything is nicely organized with a lot of associates to help for what you're looking for. The testers are also a lot cleaner and full so it's a little bit easier to test out! I did not purchase anything at these stores because I found most of what I was looking for in DQ. The majority of the stuff here were makeup but there are actual counters with people who will help you with specific brand-skincare products! The prices here are a little higher than other stores.

**--- Matsumoto Kiyoshi**

These are scattered everywhere in Shibuya. And it is primarily like what I would considered like Walgreens/CVS in America. The primarily focus is for skincare/makeup. But I would say that that there were more choices for makeup than skincare. I personally didn't buy anything here because it has a bit of a smaller selection IMO. And by the time I visited this, I have already purchased almost everything I wanted already!

**--- Misc. Corner/Health & Beauty Stores**

The only reason I ran around and looking at these is because I could not find the Biore Pink Bottle OR the Shiseido Lash Curlers anywhere. I did eventually find it in a random store in Shibuya at the very last minute, in which I bought 3 bottles because it took me FOUR HOURS to find it. They are usually a little bit smaller than the previous stores I mentioned.

###Part D. Products

I know some people were asking about how much I spent (please give or take $100 because I might've missed a receipt or two). I did my best to keep all the receipt I received!

**Japan** -- Y55,064 (~$513.80) & **Korea** -- 1,178,760KRW (~$982.83)

This is my *personal* excel sheet that I actually use (except beautified a little for y'all), so feel free to refer back to it now and then. I will be updating this for my own references :)

**--- [Face Wash](https://imgur.com/BtSddhd)** | AKA Me trying to find the best product for my skin. So far the ones I have used aren't what I would say life-changing yet. I bought a lot of the innisfree ones because they were having 1+1 deal on most of their face wash!

* **Laneige Fresh Calming pH Balancing Cleaner** 
* **Nature Republic Green Derma Mild Foam Cleanser** | N/A. One of the first products I bought. It was marketed to help with dry and sensitive skin so I decided to just pick one up. I wouldn't have picked this up at the end of my trip.
* **ROHTO Melano CC Vitamin Face Wash** 
* **innisfree Green Tea Foam Cleanser** 
* **innisfree Green Tea Morning Cleanser** 
* **innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam** 
* **innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Cleanser (3x)**
* **innisfree Minimum Cleansing Lotion** 
* **innisfree White Pore Cleanser EX** 

**--- [Bundles](https://imgur.com/jULsFcU)** | These are usually items I wanted to purchase both of, and decided to grab the bundle for extra freebies. Associates also give you more freebies with the bundles!

* **Nature Republic Green Derma Mild Cream + Mild Cica Serum** 
* **MISSHA 24k Collagen Intensive Rich Cream** | I... got pushed into buying this. When I was at MISSHA, I was just browsing the product and I got talked into buying this. Honestly, I don't think I would reach or like this. I was only mildly perked up for it is because of how similar it looked to the Shiseido Glow Cream... 
* **A'pieu Mulberry Bundle + Carrot U** | NOT going to be my go-to grab... I also got talked into buying this bundle when I was primarily there for some makeup. Those associates really know how to work you lol. I actually don't know too much about this BUT it does seem like it's supposed to help with blemishes.
* **innisfree Green Tea Serum + Green Tea Probiotic**
* **Etude House Soon Jung Toner/Emulsion Bundle** | Same price as buying the two bottle AND you get some extra goodies!
* **Etude House Moistfull Collagen Toner/Emulsion Bundle** '
* **Goodal Green Tangerine Vit C Serum** | Comes with 2 and some extra goodies (eg. cream!)
* **Goodal Moisture Barrier Gel Cream**
* **Kose Medicated Sekkisei Toner & Emulsion** 

**--- [Sunscreen](https://imgur.com/6hQCrjb)** | I go through sunscreen like crazy because I do reapply obsessively because I'm trying to get rid of sunspots. I'm also trying to find some HG PA++++. Lots of my favorites are only PA+++.

* **ALLIE Extra UV Perfect SPF50+/PA++++** | Hot diggitiy damn, this was expensive. Usually I bring it down to my chest... but I will not be doing that with this lol. 
* **ALLIE Extra UV Gel Sunscreen - SPF50+ PA++++** | Yep. Still expensive AF. 
* **Biore UV Face Milk - SPF50+ PA++++**
* **Biore UV Bright Milk - SPF50+ PA++++ (3x)** | This was so hard to find so, yes, I bought 3. Lol.
* **Biore UV Perfect Milk - SPF50+ PA++++**
* **innisfree Daily Mild Sunscreen - SPF50+ PA++++**
* **innisfree The Minimum Sun Cream - SPF25+ PA++** | This is pretty low... but I REALLY like the texture. I will probably not repurchase.
* **Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish - SPF50+ PA+++ (2x)** | This is my current HG! I love this product, doesn't pill and goes on beautifuly. It is a little dry so I definitely moisturize my face before.
* **CANMAKE Mermaid Skin Gel - SPF50+ PA++++** 
* **NIVEA Sun Water Gel - SPF35+ PA+++** 
* **The Saem Eco Earth Power Light Sunscream - SPF50+ PA+++** | This seemed pretty light on my skin. I got this as a 1+1 hence why I got 2. 

**--- [Toners](https://imgur.com/EAGToNh)** | OK. Not all of these are really advertised as 'toners' but I kind of use it as such for the most part. 

* **Kikumasamune Bright Moist** | This seems like it's the emulsion but it's still called 'lotion'. 
* **Kikumasamune High Moist** | An HG in this community. Super excited to try it out!
* **Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner**
* **innisfree Minimum Toner**
* **innisfree Blueberry ReBalancing Skin Toner**
* **Mamonde Rose Water Toner (freebie)** | Got this as a freebie but it was big enough size for me to put it as part of the toner list.
* **Laneige Fresh Calming pH Balancing Toner**
* **Isntree Clear Skin BHA Toner** | This is 0.9% BHA, from my calculation. A little milder than my 2% pads to keep the sebums away for me
* **HADALABO Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist** | AB favorites. Super excited to try this. I bought it as bags to save space so will have to place all of these into bottles soon
* **ROHTO Hadalabo Shirojun Premium Lotion** | Already am using this, it does do some brightening and I do like it. It is a little sticky. I like enough to repurchase!

Lol at this point, I'm a little tired typing up all the products... will go back and update a little later.

**--- [Vitamin C](https://imgur.com/IpW3UeD)** | I dungoofed and got too many vitamin C. So it may or may not go poorly because it may expires.

###Part E. Current Skincare/Products

Don't worry, I won't be just bombarding my skin with all the new products. I am running out of second-cleanser and morning cleanser, toner, and moisturizer for the morning -- also desperately need more hydration at night because I feel like my face isn't moisturized enough when I wake up.

**--- Morning**

1. Splash with water
2. ROHTO Hadalabo Shirojun Premium Lotion | kind of like my 'toner' for my face, trying to get that plumped look with this and lighten my sunspot
3. (Not AB) Kiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado | love these for my eyes, it kind of reduces the darkness under my eyes and helps my eyes look very bright and awake. 
4. (Not AB) Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel | almost out, has a scent and isn't that moisturizing for my skin right now.
5. Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish - SPF50+ PA+++ | my current favorite sunscreen; minor white cast that disappears for me. Doesn't pill on my face.

**--- Night**

1. KOSE SOFTYMO Speedy Cleansing Oil | I don't wear heavy makeup BUT I do use this everyday regardless if I wear makeup to get rid of layers of sunscreen
2. Hada Labo Tokyo Gentle Hydrating Cleanser  | Running out of this, it is definitely not drying but I wouldn't say I LOVE it. Trying to swap this out but will fall back since it doesn't dry my face
3. (Not AB) TO 7% Glycolic Acid Toner OR Corx AHA/BHA Toner | Not a fan of the Corsx because it doesn't really do anything to my skin. The TO really exfoliate but it is drying, though I feel like I definitely need it. 
4. (Not AB) CeraVe PM Lotion | It really isn't as hydrating as I would like it to be; I saw that it has niacinamide that it could help my pores so I picked it up. 

**-- Potential Updates**

* Laneige Sleeping Pack (Might)
* Laneige Grapefruit Lip Sleeping Mask (Night)
* Melano CC (Morning)
* IOPE Vitamin C23 (Night) -- this is iffy, I'm not 100% sure if I want to incorporate it now.
* Corsx Advanced Snail 96 Essence (Night)
* Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner (Morning/Night)
* innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing Cleanser (Night -- once the HadoLado Tokyo runs out)
* innisfree Green Tea Morning Cleanser (Morning)
* Dr. Jart Cicapair Recover (Morning -- heard it has kind of like a 'skin-balancing' effect so definitely worth a try!)

###Part G. Misc Information

**--- Storing Your Luggage, After You Bought Too Much**

There are tons of storage lockers around Korea & Japan to store your luggage while traveling while having to wait awkwardly between the first checkout time and the check in. 

I personally went from Seoul --> Tokyo --> Seoul -(train)-> Busan --> Seoul. Don't judge my poor planning for travel LOL. 

Since I filled up an entire big suitcase with skincare and old clothes, I didn't want to carry it around with me for the rest of the trip, so I decided to drop it off at Safrex in Seoul Station before flying to Japan, and picking it up when I am back in Seoul from Busan. It was worth the 7,000 KRW/day. They also deliver to Airports & Hotels, and that was a miracle for me (I shipped 3 bags) because the bags get bulky and heavy from all my junk.

Similarly there was also a location in Shibuya Station but I just put my stuff in a coin locker instead because it was for ~5hrs. 

**--- Whoo Spa, Relaxation Bundle (Klook)**

This experience was so amazing, I had to mention it. The ladies really take the time to take care of your skin and body to make you feel extremely refreshed -- especially after all the shopping. The location is in Gangnam so it is a decent distance away from most of my shopping location but well worth it. 

It's a full skincare regimen WITH lots of massages for both your shoulders/neck and back. I definitely fell asleep because of how nice it felt. If your body is stiff, they may even use the suction cups on your back to try to loosen up the muscles. On top of all of this, you get tea, crackers, and LOTS of freebies and a discount for their product line!

**--- Artbox; Spatulas!**

[Picture for Reference](https://imgur.com/enUQ0ip). If you like cutesie things, Artbox is the place for you. However, it gets a special mention in my post because they sell packs of 30 spatulas, like the ones you can use to scoop out creams! I thought this was super cool because I'm planning to share some stuff with friends AND I hate using my hands so this is perfect! 

**--- Non-AB things I did**

[Link to Reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/df01dl/guide_my_experience_shopping_in_korea_japan/f31x4xp/?context=10000)

**--- Cheap Prescription Glasses**

I was in desperate need for new glasses and JINS was the answer for me lol. I went to the one in Japan, and was blown away for how much it costs for a pair, and that they take your prescription there itself too! Everyone speaks English fairly well, especially those who takes your prescription. My pair was 15,000Y (most costs between 6,500Y - 10,000Y). Mine came with [attachable sunglasses](https://www.jins.com/us/jins-switch) (pretty cool!). Original price was 10,000Y BUT I added blue-light filter because I spend so much time on the computer (hence this post LOL). So it was an additional 5,000Y. 

*****
THE END! ~~I will probably come back in a couple of days with my updated Excel Lists of all the products I have lined up, along with products I have used and my opinions of each product!~~ [Excel Sheet Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ypRGN9gCuire1kDFPCOkIfy5HsoN_ketNKZ6AVfjRX0)!

Of course, I hope to come back in the future with my own personal review of most of these products. Sorry for all the types that might've happened because this was so long LOL.",1570541681.0,0.98,82

Fav products you've repurchased?,"Hi everyone! I just want to know everyones fav products that they repeatedly purchased so I can try some new stuff out :)

My favourites that I have repurchased:

* Cosrx Advanced 96 Snail Mucin Power Essence: My all time favourite product, have repurchased it over 5 times by now.
* Benton Aloe BHA Skin Toner: My favourite toner to date, bought my third bottle last week!
* Cosrx Aloe Soothing Sun Cream: The only sunscreen I find that helps moisturize my skin while protecting it. I just bought my 4th tube of it!
* Banila Co's Clean it Zero: Was one of the very first korean cleanser I tried (before they reformulated and updated it). Just purchased my 4th tub (the 2nd tub of the purifying version).
* Cosrx's Clear Fit Master Acne Patches: I've bought this twice and prefer it over the original pimple patches because I think they stick better to the skin!
* Innisfree's No Sebum Mineral Powder: I've probably bought over 6 tubs of it! I even got my hands on the large size (15g) and wish they still sold it.

&#x200B;

Edit and update: Wow the response to this question has been awesome! I love hearing about everyones repurchases and have definitely added a few of the products mentioned to a to try list!!

A warning about koreandepot - bad experience,"I usually lurk but had to make an account to tell about this.

I ordered the missha silk rush palette almost 2 weeks ago from koreandepot, after making sure reviews were ok about the site. I got it because every other site had it as 60+ USD (for whatever godforsaken reason lmao) and it was listed as on sale for 35 USD. No contact or reply from the company about shipping, but as I just checked (I'm a bit needy and just check every day about purchases), I see that the price jumped to 55 USD (listing price changed as ~77USD) and IN STOCK (and checked, able to be purchased) but I receive an email anyway about how it's unfortunately out of stock and I will have to be refunded. I confronted them about this discovery and they're only giving me half-answers which is suspicious to me.

It's all terribly inconvenient that the price doubled overnight, is available to purchase, but mine is canceled, and CS is dancing around my questions and won't tell me what happened. I'm sure others have had ok experiences but I will never order from here again. It's probably the only bad experience I've had ordering online for AB.

I'd recommend beautyboxkorea, jolse, roseroseshop, or missbeautykorea as alternatives.

EDIT: aaaand 2 seconds I notice my phone autocorrected the store name, it's KOREADEPART. thanks phone!

EDIT 2: they actually admitted to it in the last email. copy and paste:

""We are deeply sorry for the incident.
Due to supply matter, the supply price has been increased
significantly so we had no choice but to increase the price for the
item.
If you want, you can cancel the item or pay the difference to receive the item.

"COSRX Aloe Soothing Sun Cream SPF50 PA+++, 50ml","I read some really great reviews about this suncream and how it made people have that so much desired glowy look. I also came across reviews where people had gotten major breakouts from it. I went ahead and purchased it, and I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks. Sad to say that it has been breaking me out. I tried to deny that it has because I love the way it makes my skin feel/look. Usually my skin is red and dehydrated/dull, but when I put this on it looked dewy. But after about 6+ hours when I got home, I would notice small red pimples and bumps on my face. I usually only break out on my chin/forehead but this time I had pimples on my cheeks.

Routine + Makeup in an overnight bus... how would you do it?,"Hello there!  


An overnight bus is pretty convenient, but I'm not sure how it's possible to survive a ride like that without looking like a sleepless zombie. Applying the usual night routine before going to the bus stop would make sense. Trying to sleep could be helpful. But what would you do after that?   
Cleaning the face seems to be kinda impossible (no water for cleanser) and applying makeup would be a challenge (especially eyeliner). Finding a clean bathroom in the station won't be easy as well.Are disposable makeup wipes an option to remove the sleeping mask?  


 I'm curious about your ideas!",1570226157.0,0.9,4
Herbal bathing helped me with redness and irritation,"I have eczema, which comes with the status effects of dry, red, irritated, flaky, sensitive skin.  I am literally a sensitive snowflake.  Even stress causes skin cracking breakouts.  I have tried for years to just moisturize and pack on the oils, creams, etc.  What I finally realized was more effective for me was using some of the more recent acne treatment stuff that focuses on soothing skin.  

 A lot of the touted ingredients for calming skin are herbs that I could find at my local chinese grocery store.  I used shangxi liang cha, which I think was a blend of several cooling herbs, and added some extra licorice, green tea, angelica root, and mugwort.  Boiled it all in a big pot, which I dumped into my warm bath, then sprinkled chrysanthemum and chamomile.  Anyways, I just put on some netflix, sat back, and relaxed.  I bathed for about 45 minutes to an hour.  

if you use bath bombs, SCREW YO BATH BOMBS.  Herbal bath blends are where its at.

Prior to bathing, my skin was as red as rudolph's nose.  My face and neck weren't exposed to the water because I need to breath, and they were still red.  It was such a dramatic difference.  I'm going to replace my stock as I use it with herbal powders so I don't have to boil my water first.  

Looking back now, I would have strained all that or put the florals into a cold brew bag because it was a giant pain to clean up.  I'm out of the original tea I was using, so next time I will be using a blend of angelica root, marshmallow root, slippery elm bark, licorice root, centella asiatica powder, colloidal oatmeal, green tea, chamomile, and chrysanthemum.  I might toss in some longan honey, jujube, and goji berries too.  I think I'll just do a blend of all my powders that I want to put in, and do a blend of my solids that I can put into a cold brew bag or two and just toss in the bath.  I also throw in a vitamin c tablet to dechlorinate my water.  

If you have a bath, give this a shot.  Maybe don't go over the top like I did and use every cooling herb you can find and just start with one or two that you know work for you.",1570223464.0,1.0,8

"Reviews for Kiku Masamune High Moist, Hado Labo Premium, and Cezanne High Moist","I've been on a quest to remedy my extremely dry and dehydrated skin for a few months, and I decided to incorporate watery lotion ""toners"" into my routine to hopefully boost hydration. Thick lotions just weren't cutting it, and I was sick of my skin hurting and flaking all of the time.

I tested out three that I kept reading about here on Reddit: Hado Labo Premium (gold packaging), Cezanne High Moist, and Kiku Masamune High Moist. Maybe because my skin has been *so* dehydrated, my results were a little different than a lot of the reviews I read, so I wanted to share what I could with you.

Again, my skin is extremely dry and prone to dehydration. It's not particularly acne prone, except for occasional hormonal cystic acne close to my period. I've always thought I had very sensitive skin, but I'm finding that as it heals, it's less and less prone to irritation. No diagnosed eczema or rosacea, though I do have PIE and some chronic redness around my nose/above my mouth that I don't know the cause of.

First up:

**Product**: Kiku Masamune High Moist

**Notable ingredients**: Rice ferment filtrate (sake), ceramide 3, ceramide 6 II, amino acids, arbutin, placenta extract.

**First impressions**: Very, very watery. This was the first product that I bought to try to combat dehydration. I thought, ""There is no way this will do anything at all."" I did an allergy test, and when it seemed fine, I put some on my chin. [Holy ravioli](https://media.tenor.com/images/185dc88d96c42133b776ac17bfdac228/tenor.gif), the immediate difference was insane. My skin instantly felt smoother and hydrated, or like my pores had opened up, and I cannot stress to you how fast this happened. I was legitimately blown away by the difference, and I wanted to slather my face in it... but I was trying to be responsible about patch testing. :)

**Smell**: I'm going to include this separately for this product because, as most of you probably know, this toner's smell gets pretty mixed reactions. I don't know what sake smells like, so if it smells like sake, I wouldn't know. To me, it's got a light scent that dissipates to almost nothing after a minute. It reminds me a little bit of silicone. My four-year-old swears it smells like bananas, but *she's* bananas.

**Value**: I'm not sure you can buy much of anything with a better value. Rather than get a decant, I ordered a bottle off of Amazon because it was only $13 and it is *huge*. It's 16.9 ounces. I know it's hard to judge these things, but I've been using several layers of it on my face twice daily as well as on my arms for a month, and I would say I'm about a fourth of the way through the bottle. If your skin is less dehydrated/dry than mine, it will probably last you a lot longer. (If your skin is *dryer*, you're probably just a patch of leather.)

**Reactions**: None to speak of. I know not everyone reacts well to ferments, but I wasn't bothered by this at all. Some reviews I've read mention brightening and whitening effects, but that definitely does not happen for me. I don't know if I'm defective or something, but it just doesn't happen. My skin does feel smoother after I use it, though.

**After a few weeks**: I still really love it, but I find that it takes a lot longer to sink in than Cezanne and Hado Labo, which annoys me just a little. Then again, it still sinks in very quickly on my arms, so it's possible that the skin on my face is just in better condition now.

**Repurchasing**: Oh yeah. Even if it's not my favorite of these three toners, it's still pretty wonderful for adding layers of hydration. It's not quite holy grail status, but it's pretty close.

\--------------

**Product**: Hado Labo Premium

**Notable ingredients**: Hydroxyethyl urea, 5 types of HA.

**First impressions**: The consistency is significantly less runny than Kiku. Although it is still watery and easy to spread, it doesn't run directly off my face like water and Kiku. It's thicker than most serums I've seen, but more watery than a gel. For me, there's no significant smell to speak of. I decided to patch test this on my chin with no other products underneath it. It actually stung a little after I applied it and I was worried that I might be allergic, but I kept it on anyway (ill-advised in general). After about five minutes, the stinging stopped. I mentioned above that my skin felt smoother when I used Kiku, but that's nothing in comparison to this. My skin feels like velvet after I use Hado Labo. I don't even know that it's supposed to do it. It absorbs fairly quickly and it doesn't dry sticky.

**Value**: If you're an Amazon shopper, this formulation comes at a great value. It is $13 for 170ml (about 5.7 ounces). This price makes it quite a bit more expensive than Kiku, but Kiku is really an anomaly. I actually ordered a decant of this at first because a bottle was not eligible for returns, and I was worried about being stuck with a product I couldn't use.

**Reactions**: Nothing but positives over here. After I use it, my skin feels smoother and looks brighter. It gives me a nice glow, which I love.

**After a few weeks**: I *love* it. It is 100% a holy grail product for me. This is the second product I use every morning, and then I use a layer at night as well.

**Repurchasing**: [http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o/giphy.gif](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/S3Ot3hZ5bcy8o/giphy.gif)

\-----------------

**Product**: Cezanne High Moist

**Notable ingredients**: Ceramides, Job's tears, HA, collagen, amino acids.

**First impressions**: The consistency is basically the same as Kiku. It may be *slightly* less runny, but not by much. There's no smell that I can detect. I patch tested on one cheek and had no issues with it at all. It absorbed much quicker than Kiku, and I could feel a difference in hydration. Considering the ingredients, I expected a smoothing/brightening effect, but I didn't get any of that.

**Value**: If you're an Amazon shopper, this formulation is a horrible rip-off. Just kidding. But not really. It's like $26 for 500ml (16 ounces), but the good news is you can buy the same amount on eBay for roughly $17.

**Reactions**: Nothing negative. By the time I introduced this, my skin was significantly less dehydrated and less sensitive, so I didn't have any issues incorporating it into my routine.

**After a few weeks**: Despite wholly different ingredients, this product is basically interchangeable with Kiku for me. I have no idea why, but it just doesn't seem to do much of anything.

**Repurchasing**: No. It's fine, but since it doesn't really do anything specific for me, I'll probably just add an additional layer of Kiku rather than buy this.

How do you keep up with new cushion releases? What are you using/loving right now?,"I order new cushions and refills of HG cushions probably about **every 6 months** and it seems like every time there are ***HUNDREDS*** of new cushion releases! Ok - perhaps I'm exaggerating, but wouldn't a **semi-annual roundup** be nice? 

Even just looking back at my purchasing history (as far back as I can see), I look like I have slight cushion commitment issues. Compare that to my skincare products, which have basically remained the exact same in the past few years! 

Case in point: 

* 2017 
   * LIRIKOS Marine UV Water Cushion (HG?) + refills
   * IOPE AIR Cushion Matte Long Wear 
   * HERA UV MIST Cushion Ultra Moisture (HG!) + refills
* 2018 
   * NAKEUP FACE WaterKing Cover Cushion
   * HERA NEW UV MIST Cushion Ultra Moisture refills (changed formula!) 
   * SULWHASOO Perfecting Cushion Brightening
* 2019
   * NAKEUP FACE WaterKing Cover Cushion refills (potential HG...) 
   * HERA BLACK CUSHION refills (Original HG discontinued?!) 
   * moonshot Micro Correct Fit Cushion 
   * MISSHA Glow Tension Cushion

Toners in your hair?,"Okay so I bought 3252562 bottles of the soonjung toner when I had really messed up my skin... but when I had 1 left, I purchased the pyunkang yul toner and really loved it, thus I couldn't bring myself to use the last bottle when I had one I loved more and this was just ' safe and good enough' for my skin. 

So at 2am once, I had this /excellent/ idea to decant it into a spray bottle and mix it with castor oil because I ran out of my usual thin oil ( cant use straight oils as a leave in because my hair SUCKS THEM UP) ... and since I have been using this creation as a leave in product for my hair in scalp for after ive washed it and before I dry it..... Does anyone else do this sort of thing, or am i insane? 

Ps- I have a chronically itchy scalp..not flaky and i get head pimples quite a lot, I think because my hair is super thick and I'm a dancer and I hate washing my hair because I don't like my hair until days 2-6 of not washing it tbh .. and I believe its helped with my head pimples lol",1569916392.0,0.7,15

[REVIEW] ARITAUM GINGER SUGAR OVERNIGHT LIP MASK,,1569870800.0,0.73,3
Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence,"I have always struggled with sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skin. I’ve tried and tested an abundance of essences and moisturisers that will help both the healing of my acne, whilst being non irritating for my sensitive skin but delivery enough moisture for the dehydration. 
I think I’ve finally found it! I’ve had my eyes on this product for a year now but the price always put me off buying it online. The ingredients list is amazing, 63% propolis extract, 10% royal jelly extract and 10% honey extract. All of this without added fragrance or harsh chemicals! 
After a local Skinfood store opened in my area in Tokyo, I was able to try and test the formula and consistency. It’s application is smooth, and whilst slightly tacky at first, after tapping into the skin I feel that it definitely sinks in and reveals a glowy base. 
After 2 months of use, both morning and night, I have noticed my skin looking and feeling more plump and bright. I usually have quite deep set smile lines, but they have reduced significantly. The texture of my skin has become smoother and pores less defined. As for my acne, I was breaking out due to using Japanese products that have harsh ingredients, but since using this essence, I haven’t had a single breakout, and also my hyperpigmentation plus pitted scars have improved! 
Now I do find that it isn’t a stand alone product, meaning that I do need to use an occlusive moisturiser on top in order to maximise the moisturisation (I have severely dehydrated skin though). I would like to try the moisturiser from this line in the future! 
I would honestly say this is a miracle product and I can see now why it has been popular for such a long time. I only wish I had bought it sooner! I would definitely repurchase this product in bulk as I’m afraid of running out❤️",1569889305.0,0.96,53

"[News] Sidmool releases new fragrance-free ampoule with 5% Niacinamide, 1% Madecassoside, 1% Titrated Extract of Centella Asiatica, and 1-5% Panthenol!","I love Sidmool because they're often transparent about exactly how much of a given active ingredient they put in their products (and actually use functional amounts!) and most of their products are fragrance and EO free, and this new ampoule is no different.

It's called the [Macenna 115 Ampoule](http://www.sidmool.com/shop/shopdetail.html?branduid=77195&xcode=020&mcode=029&scode=&type=Y&sort=order&cur_code=020029&GfDT=aWV9), although I'm not sure what macenna (마센나) means. The price is 18,600 won, which is about $15.50 USD. (If you're buying it in the US, the price will likely be a bit higher due to shipping costs). In addition to what's listed in the title, the serum contains 67% centella asiatica extract.

They don't state exactly how much panthenol is in the serum, but based on its position in the ingredients list, there must be between 1-5% in there. (In Korea, ingredients must be listed in order of amount unless it's less than 1%.) The only thing that would make this better is if they included n-acetyl glucosamine to boost the niacinamide, but alas, we can't have everything.

*Review* :
I'm in love with the packaging because I like really simple sleek designs :)
 Though I prefer transparent bottles. The pump is great and gives me exactly the quantity I need for a full face of makeup.
It has a nice smell but it's really discrete and not overpowering at all.
It leaves no residue after emulsifying and is thinner than other cleansing oils I've used (so I have to work just a liiil bit harder when removing my mascara). <- it does not sting my eyes.
I had to go a whole summer without oil cleansing and my skin immediately got so much better after getting this in the mail 😂

It's certainly thinner and has less of a smell but it gets the job done and the packaging/quantity is much better. The price per ml is also similar. The smell is also less overpowering but I didn't mind that in the first place.

Indian chemical skincare,"Indian skincare is usually synonymous with natural, which overlooks the incredibly cheap and easily available ingredients available without a prescription. Here's a list of my favourites which I buy from my local chemists or amazon. Some were recommended by my dermatologist, and some I found after research. I have had far better results with these than any natural drugstore products or home remedies, and I really wish people weren't so fixated on being ""natural"" and ""chemical-free"" when we have such effective and medical grade skincare that is so easily accessible.

**Face**:

* **Aziderm** (Azelaic acid 20%): My absolute HG. My skin is super sensitive and prone to breakouts/rashes/overexfoliation, and I can use this almost every day with no adverse effects. I put it before bed, seal it with a gel moisturizer, and when I wake up my skin is brighter, smoother, looks airbrushed and my pores are nearly invisible. It helps with hyperpigmentation, CCs and rosacea.
* **Sebogel** (Salicylic Acid 2%, Niacinamide 7%) I use this as both a spot treatment and face mask around once a week. It works just like any SA treatment and clears my pores, while the niacinamide is brightening.
* **Kojivit Plus** (Octinoxate 7.5%, Glycolic acid 3%, Kojic acid 2.5%, Arbutin 1.5%): Spot treatment for hyperpigmentation and acne. If I'm not using Biluma, I use this, and it's really gentle and effective.
* **Biluma** (Kojic acid, Arbutin) This fades dark spots like nobody's business. When my skin was at its worst, I mixed it with **Nadoxin** and put it on both active acne and acne scars before bed and it completely nuked them.
* **Glycol 6** (Glycolic acid 6%): I use this as a mask once in 2 weeks or so, and it really makes my skin even and soft.

**Body**:

* **Triluma** (Hydroquinone 4%, Tretinoin 0.05%): I use this for the KP and acne scars on my back. Tried using it on my face once and it peeled so badly lmao.
* **Glycol 12** (Glycolic acid 12%): Same use as above.
* **Urelact** (Urea 10%, Lactic acid 10%): I have horrible ingrown hair on my legs, which urea is supposed to help with. This exfoliates pretty well. I mix it with Salicylix SF and use it a couple times a week.
* **Salicylix SF** (Salicylic Acid 6%): Recommended by my dermatologist. I put this on my legs and back for a few hours to unclog the KP.

These products have worked far better for me than any other skincare. I still use normal skincare products in my routine, but the products mentioned above are the heavy hitters and the rest just sort of assist them. A lot are left over from my haul phase where I bought a lot of stuff without understanding my skin needs or type, so I'm trying to use them up. But I've found that my skin reacts the best to a minimalistic routine with a maximum of 3 layers. I don't have a fixed routine, I just use what my skin needs from day to day.

Favourite Matte and Cosmetically Elegant Sunscreens,"I’ve been on the long journey of testing a plethora of sunscreens. 

I have tried this lot:
• Anessa Milk
• Biore Watery Essence 2015, 2017, and 2019
• Biore Watery Gel 2015, and 2017
• Cosrx Aloe Sun Cream
• Skin Aqua Watery Gel
• La Roche Posay Anthelios Light (European and American Versions)

I only appreciated the biore watery essence from the lot. The rest were either to thick or had a strong white cast.  I’d like to know what sunscreens you lot like. Preferably one that’s moisturizing, but matte and cosmetically elegant.

I’m eyeing the Klairs airy sun essence, but i’m sorted it would make me look shiny and greasy due to its lack of alcohol. 

thanks lots!",1569573574.0,0.95,46

"Saborino 60-second Morning Masks(yellow, fruty herbal)","***i'm going to start by saying that this is only my 4rth review ever and i'm so happy people are interested. i'm going to start hopefully next week to post video and HD photo reviews(i'm getting my camera upgraded)***  

***My skin: sensitive and dry***

I’m a bit sad that I’m writing this at the end of the summer, but I also use it during winter so I am going to write about it now. I’m going to **start by warning that this is strongly smelling and contains alcohol** so it might be a turn off for some. I am always SUPER careful when it comes to products with alcohol so I get if it might make you not want to use it. It comes in a pack of 32 so it will last you some time. I store them in the fridge after opening.

Marketing wise this is a 3in1 product, it is “cleansing, toning, and priming” it cleans nicely and does do the advertised skin tightening (my pores are way smaller and don’t clog up). the yellow one is the moisturizing one, it is not.

By now you might be wondering why I use this if it does not moisturize my face well? It has another function I am after; it is the best depuffer I have ever used. A lifesaver after my light night binge eating. It is also VERY cooling so if it is very hot outside it really helps your face cool down and not feel flushed. 

How I use it: the mask is not very wet, so it is a bit more mess free than normal sheet masks. I start by just putting it on my face first thing in the morning (I use it like 1x every 2 weeks for the most part, max 1x in a week) you will immediately feel the menthol smell**.**  **if you have a history of irritation around menthol I would not buy this.** it feels a bit tingling on the skin. The mask might be small on some people so you might have to stretch it out on your face, on my it is kind of large. 

https://i.redd.it/4nti06ozaxo31.png

**Make sure to not get it in your eyes.** The mask has a design problem, the eyeholes are a bit too small, so you must be careful to not get it in your eyes. I leave it on a bit longer than the 60sec. (around 2 minutes) while I get out of bed. I then use the mask as a wipe to finish cleaning the face.

This is advertised as a no rinse product, but I always just rinse my face a bit after using it. Like micellar water it is isn’t rinse free (my opinion). Your face will feel cold for the next hour or so, but it is important to note that it is just the **menthol blocking heat signals from your face and not the temperature of the skin.** When I take it of my pores are noticeable smaller and my face is a lot less puffy. I then proceed with Etude House Soon Jung pH 5.5 Relief Toner(it is a a bit acidic) to rebalance my skin and then my layers of moisture(usually after using this I use benton snail bee essence, mizon snail recovery gel cream and then orgins mega mushroom(non AB) moisturizer, bb cream with spf50, innisfree no sebum moisture powder). 

Im so torn on this product as I now it does little other than clean and depuff and has alcohol and menthol in it but I still really like the feeling in the morning of putting it on. On some days my skin is a bit red for 20mins after putting it on, but I feel it is worth it. I have had the same parcel for 4 months now and I have almost finished it….. but I might not get it again if I find something that works as well with better ingredients. Overall I would recommend this to people with normal to oily skin more than dry if you don’t want to go through a full routine in the morning. **(Rating 5/10. A love hate mask that is a bit loose on the promises)**

[REVIEW] PURITO Centella Green Level Calming Toner review!!!,"I have oily, somewhat acne-prone skin. I am trying to use mild products in my skin care routine due to my sensitive skin.  

**PURITO Centella Green Level Calming Toner/200mL** 

Especially loving this ingredients list! PURITO has no harmful and allergic ingredient, and this is why I tried to use it for the first time. I heard that they are planning to formulate unscented version for toner, so I’m looking forward to it.  This product has a flower smell. It’s not strong as perfume, but I recommend you to get a sample product before buying it if you have a sensitive nose. This has jelly-like texture and it is thicker than water but not sticky at least to me.  It doesn’t irritate my skin and it’s soothing and safe for me to use at anytime. It’s not really hydrating toner, but calming just like its name. This is the most effective toner for my skin. I just recommended it to my friend who has a sensitive skin type and always has skin concerns, and she said that it really calms to be soothing and not irritating at all.

Comparison review between 3ce soft lip lacquer and Etude House matte chic lip lacquer,"3ce Soft Lip Lacquer V.S Etude House Matte Chic Lip Lacquer 

I have the Etude House (EH) in the shade BR401 «Wendy Brown» and 3ce in «Neutral Avenue». 3ce is completely true to the official swatch, which I find quite impressive seeing it’s such a light shade. EH, on the other hand, not so much. On me there’s nothing brown about Wendy brown, and it’s much brighter than what is shown in the official swatches. On me it’s a dark reddish rose color, and definitely more of a statement red lip than what I was expecting. It’s still a really beautiful color, though. Both products have a good shade-range, though my personal preference lies with 3CE’s shades.


Now for the scent, the 3ce smells like vanilla or some other form of sugar - it’s the same scent as their Velvet lips tints. I personally like it, but anyway it doesn’t really linger. The EH smells faintly of chemicals, but so faint I aqtually had to smell into the tube to notice.


As for the formula 3ce has a slightly thicker and creamier formula than EH, and it covers my lips fully with one swipe even though it is a light color. It it is not transfer-proof, but only transfers a little bit, and lasts a good amount of time. It doesn’t feel drying on my lips, but it doesn’t really feel moisturizing either. I would compare it to the peripera airy ink Velvet in that regard. The EH has a wetter texture and is a little bit harder to apply, as you have to be careful not to miss any «cracks» in your lips that gets smoothed out when you smile (sorry if that’s a weird description, it’s the best I can do). Once it dries it is completely transfer proof, and it stays ON. The only enemy it has is oil, which means you can’t put lip balm underneath or on top or it will literally melt off your lips. And you’ll definitely miss the lip balm, as this is seriously drying. After a few hours I feel it has sucked all the moisture out of my lips. On the plus side the color looks just as great as when you first applied it.

For packaging and price the EH is cheaper, and I actually prefer the packaging of it as well. I have a soft spot for tall and sleek tubes and this one just fits the bill. It has a frosted glass look to it so you can see the color inside, which is cool. The 3ce is a bit shorter and stubbier, and is packaged in the color of the shade inside.


Conclusion: Even though I love 3ce, I think EH wins this one. I only use lip lacquers for special occasions, my lips are too dry for them to be a daily thing for me. I love going out for a few beers or something and knowing that my lipstick won’t budge, it gives me peace of mind. And for that I’m willing to sacrifice some moisture for a few hours. The 3ce is definitely a lot more comfortable to wear, but I also have other tints that are comfortable and long lasting and so it doesn’t really stand out for me, aside from looking super matte.",1569343618.0,0.81,1

What's the most interesting facial mask that you've ever tried?,"I love trying new and interesting things; honestly, I'm a sucker for the products that are ""gimmicky"". I would love to hear some of your suggestions and try them. In exchange, I will share some of mine!:

**KONAD Jewel Modeling Mask**

https://i.redd.it/qn6jm2vpuho31.jpg

I randomly came across this mask while searching up for stamping nail art products lol. Apparently, this has the real sapphire powder in it (!!) I ordered it on Amazon and tried it. It was really nice. I just loved the process of it. You mix the powder and the gel to create the peel-off mask and apply on your skin. After you peel off the mask, you don't have to wash your face. It leaves no residue on your skin which was really amazing. And it also made my skin super smooth and hydrated after. The thing that I loved the most was the AMAZING scent. I just really, really, reallllly loved the fragrance of this mask. It was an overall very pleasant experience!

**Blooming Beaute Hydrogel Mask**

I tried this mask ages ago. I don't even remember how long ago lol. It was the first time that I've ever tried hydrogel mask and I still remember how culturally shocked I was. It felt SO NICE and hydrating. And also, the thing that amazed me the most was how clear this was. If you're interested in how it looks, you can see it in the [link](http://img.danawa.com/images/descFiles/3/186/2185386_1_1341195386.JPG).  I sometimes think about this mask from time to time even now. I don't think this was ever sold in America and might have been discontinued in Korea as well. It makes me really sad lol T\_T

I remember buying this as a bulk (I think it was 30 dollars for 20-25 of them?) from duty free shopping at Incheon airport. I was a poor broke college student so it was a pretty big purchase at that time. After I came back to US, I used it the night I got home. And I was sooo glad that I bought it. Not only I made my mom laugh at how ridiculous I looked with this mask, but it actually did a great job at hydrating and making my skin look glowy. I still buy this mask from time to time because I really liked the first encounter with the product.

[News] LuLuLun sheet mask reformulations coming soon,"Updated versions of the [LuLuLun Precious](https://lululun.com/precious2019/) sheet masks (green, red, and gold) and [the “standard” ones in the pink, blue, and white packaging](https://lululun.com/lululun2019/) will officially be launching on October 1 and November 1 respectively (already available through selected outlets).

*Edit: As of Sept. 24, two out of three stores I’ve been to had the new versions for all six types, so they might be fairly widely available already. The two stores that had the new ones can be described as “variety shops” and the one that didn’t is a drugstore located inside of a large multistory supermarket.*

*Here’s how to tell the new and old versions apart: https://imgur.com/a/wEm6FAQ (19 photos). Official-looking product photos taken from the @cosme page linked below.*

In addition to the sheet masks’ reformulations, the box-shaped packaging for all types will also be adjusted to make the opening 1.3 cm wider and the height 1 cm shorter.


**LuLuLun Precious (green, red, and gold)**

-	All three LuLuLun Precious masks will contain the L22 complex (C18-36 Acid Triglyceride, C12-18 Acid Triglyceride, Jojoba Esters, Squalene, Phytosteryl Macadamiate, Phytosterols, Tocopherol), which used to be in the green one only
-	New ingredients in the green version: コケ細胞培養エキス *moss cell culture extract?* (Phytol, Isomalt) and Homeo-Age (Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract)
-	New (?) ingredients in the red version: L22 complex (see above), Aspergillus/Rice Ferment Extract, and Aphanothece Sacrum Polysaccharide
-	New ingredients in the gold version: L22 complex (see above) and DetoxyWhite (Lepidium Sativum Sprout Extract)


**“Standard” masks (pink, blue, and white)**

-	All three “standard” masks will contain peony extract (Paeonia Albiflora Flower Extract)
-	New ingredients in the pink version: Paeonia Albiflora Flower Extract and Yeast Extract
-	New ingredients in the blue version: Paeonia Albiflora Flower Extract, cactus extract (Opuntia Ficus-Indica Stem Extract), Regenesea (Laminaria Saccharina Extract), and Saccharide Isomerate
-	New ingredients in the white version: Paeonia Albiflora Flower Extract, β-White (Oligopeptide-68), and elderflower (Sambucus Nigra Flower Extract)


These are just the changes specifically mentioned; there could be other ingredients that will be added (or removed). There’s also a mention of reviewing the balance of the existing ingredients re: the “standard” masks (maybe the Precious line too).

[Discussion] Hanyul Pure Artemisia Mild Cleansing Foam is not a low-pH cleanser,"**Background:**

I was in Atlanta shopping around for skincare and decided to pick up Hanyul Pure Artemisia Mild Cleansing Foam on a whim.  The marketing claims sounded pretty good:  ""Mild foam cleanser that softly cleanses tired skin with a rich and ample bubble containing young artemisia. Cleans skin and brightens dull skin tone. Cleanses the inside of pores with dense and elastic foam. A mild formula that gives moist and mild finish after cleansing.""  I had assumed, due to the claims of ""mild"" cleansing, that it was a neutral to low pH cleanser since the same line also has a normal foaming cleanser.  Later that night, I used it and was impressed by the dense, thick foam.  And then I became suspicious.  Low-pH cleansers are notorious for not foaming as nicely as high-pH cleansers, and this one was just foaming too luxuriously.  So when I got back home, I tested the pH.  
  
  
  
**Methods and Results:**
  
I have a drop test kit that includes two pH tests: normal range (6.0-7.6) and high range (7.4-8.8).  The normal range goes from yellow (pH 6.0) to blue (pH 7.6) with mid pH ranges being various shades of green.  The high range goes from orange (pH 7.4) to royal purple (pH 8.8) with mid ranges being shades of reddish-orange to burgundy.  Values above or below the ranges for each test will show up as the lowest or highest value color-wise.  So, a pH 4 solution will turn yellow, whereas a pH 9 solution will turn royal purple.  
  
  
  
In a 10ml glass tube, I added a pea-sized amount of cleanser, filled with water to hit the 5ml mark, and mixed gently with a glass stirring rod to minimize foaming/bubbles and get a good, homogeneous mixture.  I then added 3 drops of the normal range kit and inverted several times as per kit instructions.  The solution immediately turned pure blue.  Disappointing.  This meant it was at least pH 7.6.  
  
  
  
I cleansed the tube and used the same procedure with the high range test (5 drops instead of 3 as per instructions).  The solution immediately turned royal purple.  Yikes.  
  
  
  
So while I don't know the exact pH, it seems that Hanyul Pure Artemisia Mild Cleansing Foam is **at least pH 8.8, potentially higher**.   As a reminder, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2mjjtv/the_rasianbeauty_cleanser_ph_list_and_ph_faq/) is the list of AB cleanser pH and notes on why cleanser pH matters.",1569192202.0,0.93,13

You know how when you first start dating, you kinda go through a series of mediocre or downright bad relationships and then you find a decent one and realize how shitty all your past relationships were?  Well, that's Jolse for me.  I've bought stuff through Amazon, Sephora (spent wayyyyy too much money there), yesstyle, and sokoglam.

&#x200B;

First off, the shipping was free, which is already amazing when it comes to shopping internationally.  Not only was it free, it was also FAST and not a single thing was damaged.  They were careful with my stuff, and there was plenty of cushioning.

&#x200B;

What really has me opening my eyes is the sheer amount of samples I got.  I've literally never gotten this many samples before.  I legit thought they sent me the wrong package at first because I kept spotting things that I didn't order.  I got a full sized hand cream, italian towel, muji socks and farmstay honey mask sheet on top of a crapton of foils and mini bottles.  I got stuff from brands I was interested in but never used, other parts of something I liked but hadn't tried the full line of, stuff I never heard of, and stuff I actually wanted to try (missha skindation).  I guess I was suprised because it seemed like the samples were actually curated nicely so that I would like and try at least one of the items.  There were practical tools, general use items (blotting papers), popular well known items, and things that wouldn't hurt to try, like a basic hand cream.

I've never gotten this many samples with this much variety from any other retailers, even if I was ordering the same $$$ amount.  I feel truly blessed.  Anyways, off to figure out how to install the filtered showerhead I ordered and test some sunscreen

Are there any sheet masks like Hado Labo’s ones that come individually wrapped?,"So today is unnaturally hot for September in Scotland, and I had to pop out for a few hours. Did my full skincare routine and applied SPF. 

However my skin gets very hot and overheated - not sunburnt. I was thinking of buying a sheetmask from Boots or Superdrug but they are £2.99 per mask. 

My original plan was to buy the Hado Labo’s sheetmasks from Dokodemo, and when my skin feels like it needs a little extra soothing/cooling, remove a sheetmask and stick it in the fridge for a few minutes and then put it on my face. 

Until I discovered that Hado Labo’s sheet masks aren’t individually wrapped.

On me it is a raspberry pink with some brown mixed in. After it fades it leaves a very strong stain that is the same raspberry pink, but without the brown. The stain looks very natural on me and the shade is also quite muted. The innisfree looks nothing like the official swatch, I was expecting a brownish-red but got a raspberry-leaning pink instead. These two shades are actually really similar on me, but bbia has a bit of brown which makes me like it more as it’s a little bit more interesting. Bbia is the clear winner shade-wise, as there is a total of 30 shades to choose from in the collection, while innisfree has 20.


Now onto the scent. Bbia smells like raspberries or strawberries to me, and I quite like the scent. Innisfree on the other hand smells like some sort of orchid body lotion, I can’t quite explain it but I didn’t care for it and it lingered for quite some time after application. 


Onto the formula; the innisfree is very pleasant to apply. It is very airy and light and remind me a little bit of the peripera airy ink velvet. You get a good color payoff with one swipe, and I didn’t find it drying. Unfortunately I found it didn’t last very long, and the stain it left behind was very weak and light-pink in color (which is basically my natural lip color). I also found that my dry patches were quite visible after I had worn it for a few hours. Bbia’s formula is not as light as the innisfree one, but it doesn’t feel heavy in any way. It has great color-payoff with one swipe and it also didn’t emphazise any dry patches. The best thing is that it isn’t drying at all and it lasts ALL DAY. After a full work-day I can still see some color on my lips even if I don’t reapply it - I usually just put some lip balm over the stain after lunch. I really can’t rave enough about the formula! 


For the packaging and price they cost about the same. The innisfree one is packaged in a simple plastic tube which (supposedly) shows the color of the tint inside. Bbia is packaged in a sleeker and taller see-through plastic tube with a different colored lid (normally gold, but it depends on the shade-collection) so you can see the tint inside. I like the packaging of the bbia more as I simply find it looks better.


It probably won’t come as a surpriss - but Bbia wins this hands down. Since the shades were so similar on me I actually gave the innisfree one away to a friend - because I knew I would reach for the bbia instead. Seriously - go try it!",1568996896.0,1.0,3
COSRX The Low pH Good Morning VS Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser,"To start of I have ultra sensitive, dry skin.

***Attencion: the salicylic gleanser got reformulated from the salicylic exfoliating one and is now marketed as an everyday product.*** 

I do want to start with a couple of scientific facts about these product. Both cleansers are paraben, sulfate, alcohol and silicone free. he morning cleanser has about 5,5ph but the **Salicylic has a 9-10ph** so it is really alkaline.(I did the acid paper test at home). We need to talk about what a alkaline cleanser can do to your face.

***“A cleanser at too high of a pH weakens those skin structures, allowing the cleansing agents in the product to strip away too many of the skin's natural lipids, compromising its overall integrity and allowing bacteria and irritants to invade and water to escape.”***

So you might feel really clean but you are inviting a lot of trouble in.

Both of those products have tee tree leaf oil(essential oil) that might be bad for sensitive skin but the morning cleanser has allantoin which is good for sensitive skin(soothing), it also has some moisturizing qualities and fits both dry and oily skin. the salicylic one is bad for both, it dries the face and has acid(Myristic, Stearic, and Lauric) in it that can block pores. on the plus side salicylic acid is good for controlling oil and sebum production. It is also a exfoliating product.  

So we know going into it that the salicylic cleanser may not be good for you but I tried them both anyways(i make questionable decisions regulary.

**The Low pH Good Morning Cleanser**

I am going to start by saying that I have repurchased this cleanser 2 times *(I first got it from a site called lookfantastic and then from a value box from yesstyle i do recommend yesstyle it cost almost half on there)* and use it in the morning if I am in a hurry and don’t want to think about it too much. It has **Betaine Salicylate(BHA).** You only need a fingernail size amount as it foams up very easily. I add water in my palm and lather it up well before putting it in my face(much better if you have sensitive skin to not foam it on your face) I rub gently for about a minute then rinse well(make sure you get it all of or you will tingle in your face for the rest of the day) I don’t feel it moisturizing my skin but it does not dry it. I then follow with toner, essence, serum and moisturizer. I use spf50 bb cream on most days but otherwise you have to use sunscreen on days you use BHA. It does help with acne but leaves my face a bit red for a couple of minutes. **(Rating 8/10 a solid value choice)** 

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/j1l1cjoh1qn31.png

&#x200B;

**Salicylic Acid Daily Gentle Cleanser.**

I got this cleanser from a value box from yesstyle and tried it a couple of times. I used a pea sized drop, lathered it and put it on my face. I worked it for a minute and then rinsed it out. To put it mildly it burned, I was a tomato for a day even after my soothing routine. It turned my hand a shade lighter from the dryness. It did exfoliate my skin right after using but then the dryness made it even more flaky*. I contacted costumer support and they told me to try it again in the shower,* I did, and it was a tiny bit better in the redness department but still very drying. I only used it for a total of 5 times. **(rating 1/10. Not usable at all, for any skin type)**

Of course, you might have a different opinion and I really would like to hear them in the comments. You can also ask me questions or request me to try products.

[Review] Benton Deep Green Tea Toner - DISASTER,"[My skin: dry and I get acne when the skin gets too dry.  Can be dehydrated mostly depending on weather.  Redness is my main issue]

So!  I bought this in the hopes of soothing my skin, improving overall redness, and reducing the chances of acne appearing.  I LOVE a good hydrating toner, so away we go.

Ingredients: 
Camellia Sinensis Leaf Water (50%), Aqua (Water), Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Pentylene Glycol, 1,2-Hexanediol, Cetearyl Glucoside, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Centella Asiatica Extract, Houttuynia Cordata Extract, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Camellia Sinensis Seed Extract, Camellia Sinensis Root Extract, Punica Granatum Fruit Extract, Tocopherol, Betaine, Arginine, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum

Texture:  Very watery.  This is probably very similar to what it would be like to put cold green tea on the skin.  It sinks it very quickly, especially if your skin is thirsty like mine. 

The first two weeks I was having a great time!  I slotting in this product before my standard hydrating toner (Klairs Unscented), so it was acting like an FTE going directly onto clean skin, morning and evening.  It sank in immediately and everything going well.

Then, around week 3 my face started getting dry and no biggie, just some weather changes.  Let's pile on the hydrating layers!  So I upped things to 2 or 3 of the Benton and 2 or 3 of the Klairs.  However while it seems like dehydration was taken care of, my face *craved* oil.  My rosehip seed oil started getting sucked in right quick.  Small bits of acne started to appear as is normal for me when my skin gets dry.

You see, **I had completely forgotten green tea regulates sebum production**.  And sebum regulation is exactly what I DO NOT need.

So!  Once I realize my error (2 weeks later), I dropped out the Benton and my face went back to normal.

Recommendation:  This has been one of the few times where I have seen such noticeable impact of a product on the daily functioning of my skin.  While not for me, if you are looking to reduce sebum production I would recommend the Benton Deep Green Tea Toner without hesitation.  It is cosmetically elegant, minimal potential irritants, a straight-forward addition to a routine, and affordable.

Apologies for the clickbait title.  It was an interesting product to try and interesting skin adventure!  Cheers!",1568938250.0,0.73,3

I made a Skincare Comparison tool (that also does CosDna comparisons),"I also plan on posting this in r/SkincareAddiction. I made a Skincare Comparison tool (that also does CosDna comparisons). It's called Skincare Compare @ [https://skincarecompare.me](https://skincarecompare.me).

This has been a personal project of mine for the last few months! I have very sensitive skin that breaks out in angry eczema patches if it touches anything it hates (which seems like everything), so I have a spreadsheet with every product I've tested, its ingredient list, and if it made me break out or not.

However, comparing ingredients by hand seemed like a pain, so I created this tool to make my life easier. Over time, I decided to make it a website, in case it would possibly help anyone else.

If you have any questions, email me at the email in the [About](https://skincarecompare.me/about) page, comment, or DM me on Reddit.

There's multiple tools on this website:

**1) .csv Comparisons**

This is on the main page. You upload a .csv file, which can be generated from Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, any other spreadsheet software, or even Notepad. The .csv file should have two columns: Ingredients and Result (you can have other columns, but the tool will ignore the other columns).

The tool will find comparisons throughout the whole .csv and generate lists based on shared ingredients amongst all the ingredients, shared ingredients that you're allergic to, shared ingredients you're not allergic to, and etc.

You can put a list of ingredients OR CosDna links in the Ingredients column. You specify whether you're safe/allergic to the ingredients list in question in the Results column, or simply ""TBD"" if you want to find comparisons but don't have the result yet.

There's a detailed [HOW TO](https://skincarecompare.me/howto) guide, along with template and example .csvs.

**2) Quick Compare**

This tool was more inspired by this [tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/3g34we/cosdna_comparison_tool/) on r/AsianBeauty, but his tool unfortunately hasn't been working for me. You basically either put in a list of ingredients OR CosDna links, and the tool will generate lists of shared or non-shared ingredients.

**3) CosDna quick scraper**

If, for some reason, you don't want to put CosDna links inside your spreadsheet or if you just want to grab a list of ingredients from a CosDna link, you can input a CosDna link and it'll give you a formatted list of ingredients, separated by commas.",1568917279.0,0.99,16
Oily skin type people what moisturiser you're currently using? Would you get a heavier one for night/dry weather?,"I'm currently using the Cosrx Green Tea Aqua Soothing Gel Cream.

Kao’s Curél brand to be launched in the US and Europe by the end of 2019,"Good news for a lot of you with sensitive skin: I just heard someone on YouTube mention in passing that [Kao’s Curél brand](https://www.kao.com/jp/en/curel/index.html) is scheduled to launch officially in the US and Europe by the end of the year. I found the article they were probably referring to ([週刊粧業「花王 キュレル、年内に欧米展開でさらなる成長へ」](https://www.syogyo.jp/news/2019/09/post_025201), September 17, 2019) and the headline says exactly that, but it’s on a specialized newspaper for the industry (with a paywall) and I couldn’t actually read it.

I did however also find confirmation on Kao’s official website, in the “Accelerate Global Expansion of Three Mass Brands” section of the May 18, 2018 press release titled [Kao Group Cosmetics Business Building a New Global Portfolio](https://www.kao.com/global/en/news/2018/20180518-001/): “Curél will be expanded in Japan and Asia and is projected to launch in Europe and the US from 2019.”

I’m kind of confused about how this is going to work in relation to [the other (?) Curél](https://www.curel.com/en-us/about/curel-history/), but I guess this means the Japanese Curél products will be officially available in Europe and the US.

So if you’re in Europe or the US and are planning on importing Japanese Curél products but aren’t in a hurry, it might be a good idea to wait for more information about possible availability in your area.

(If you *are* kind of in a hurry, you might as well go for it. I’m guessing it’s going to take a while for the products to actually be available, since there isn’t a bigger announcement on the official website yet. And who knows whether they’ll have all the products right away, anyway.)",1568841472.0,0.97,4

[SPOILER] Product list from the yesstyle kosmetopia advent calendar 2019 - Is it a good deal?,"So, I am completely obsessed with beauty advent calendars but this is the first year I heard about this advent calendar from yesstyle. In my eyes, it is super expensive though and I am a student, so my budget it tight. (I usually buy two 15 $ calendar at my local drug store but they are nice too!)

Before buying something like this, I always watch some unboxing youtube videos but there are none for the yesstyle one. So I finally saw the link to the product list on their website and thought I'd post it here (copy pasted) with a few questions. Do you think it's a good deal? I'm completely new to asian beauty products so I really do not know whether the products are worth it or not. I only really know the brand Etude House and Missha and like their products.

"[Discussion] Cheap, Asian Beauty Shop: BonjourHK","I recently came across a site that bases its headquarters in Hong Kong named BonjourHK, or Zhouyue. It sells a wide variety of AB products and popular western brands as well, but the prices of their products are ridiculously low. Being a somewhat cynical person myself, I contacted their customer support. Someone named Amy assisted me in my questions, but occasionally when I used more complex proverbs and sentence structures, they couldn't understand me, which leads me to think that they're more of a Chinese to English translator than a native speaker. Completely fine, of course, but definitely something to note if you want to contact their live support. 

Before we delve in deeper, BonjourHK is a legitimate site, not a scam. They claim to be one of the leading cosmetic retailers in Hong Kong, with over 39 physical stores in the region. They are ""accredited by the Hong Kong Tourism Board with Quality Tourist Service Sign of Quality."" 

However, there are some parts of their website that concern me. For one, my cart totaled up to 270 HKD, which roughly amounts to $35 USD, proven by both Google and my card provider. However, when I changed my region from HK to the U.S., the amount suddenly rocketed up to $45 USD, exclusive of shipping. This leads me to think they added the shipping cost into the total amount, but the problem is that they still have an additional shipping cost after that. I personally prefer if sites would be honest and come up straight about that. Eh. 

Also, when I searched up Zhouyue (Mandarin version of the website's name) on a Chinese server, there were many results like, ""Are Sasa (another cheap online retailer based near China) and Zhouyue (BonjourHK) scam sites?"" With my rusty Mandarin, the general consensus I gleaned was, ""Cheap things are cheap for a reason. Although they certainly aren't scam sites, their deals may not be as good as they seem."" I think a user touched upon expiration dates, although I'm not sure exactly what they said. When I tried to check for expiry dates, the answer in the FAQ was, ""Freshness of our products is guaranteed as we keep all our stock in a temperature controlled environment prior to shipping and subject to regular quality control checks. The production date of the products are confidential internal information of manufacturer, we could not provide customers a specified products production date."" Sounds iffy to me, but that's only a personal opinion.

So the general point of this post was, has anyone had any experience with this site? If so, negative or positive? And if not, I hope this will at least prove to be useful to some people in the future. Thanks!",1568697200.0,0.86,16

"I'm (east) Asian and some of my coarser body hair follicles seem to be too strong(?) to be pulled by my epilator. Am I imagining things, or does this happen to you too?","Nothing I've seen in my web searches says this is a real thing, but most articles that come up are written with white people in mind, so I'd like to ask other Asians who have hair that's very coarse in some areas (eg. commonly pubic and armpit hair).

I'll pull the skin tight and use the epilator like normal (it works just fine on the rest of my body where the hair is softer), but the hair follicles of my armpit seem to be too damn strong? Like, the epilator is obviously contacting the skin and hair is being pulled at because I can feel it -- the pain, sound, and vibration, just not getting pulled out, even if I hold it in place for several seconds, which you're not supposed to do. They'll slowly get pulled one hair at a time after many passes over the same area, but that's very irritating to your skin, and many times the pain as well.

The reason I'm pretty sure this is a ""hair too strong"" thing is because when I use it on my legs for instance, there will be a visibly thicker, darker hair occasionally, and it won't get pulled out when I pass over while all the finer hairs in the same area *are*  pulled out. Then I'll have to pass over a ton of times or even hold the epilator in place for a while (or give up and get tweezers) for it to get pulled.

I have a Panasonic ES-ED50 which AFAIK is a pretty decent alternative to Braun.

Comparison review between A’pieu Water Light Tint and Romand Juicy Lasting Tint,"I did a comparison post a couple of weeks a go that a few of you found helpful, so I thought I’d do another one today :)


A’pieu Water Light Tint V.S Romand Juicy Lasting Tint:


I have the A’pieu in the shades «RD03» and «CR02», and the Romand in the shade «FigFig». I would say all shades are very true to swatch, They all go on quite muted with one layer, but can be built up to a more «true» color with two layers. I absolutely love the shades I have, and both lines have a lot of beautiful and different colors to choose from.


Now for the scent. Both lines smell sweet, and it doesn’t linger after application. The A’pieu scent is the same for both shades, a sort of artificial sweet smell. As I only have one shade of the Romand I can’t say if the scent is the same among the shades, but I don’t think so as each shade represents a fruit. FigFig smells sweet as well, but in a less artificial way than A’pieu, so I prefer the romand. 


Next up is formula. They are really similar in formula, as they are glossy tints with good color-pay off and staining ability. The A’pieu can be built up with two layer to show the actual shade, while one layer will still show the shade but «mixed» with your natural lip color. They last for a few hours and leave a muted stain behind. They are very comfortable to wear and do give your lips some moisture. One thing I have found is that if my lips are really dry these do tend to darken in color where the dry patches are, and so can look a little patchy after they «dry down» and the glossiness fades. It’s something to be aware of if you have really dry lips. The romand applies more evenly than the apieu, and I get a better color pay-off with just one swipe. It’s more moisturizing, and I have never experienced any patchiness with it. It lasts longer too, and leaves a stronger stain behind. I prefer the formula of the Romand more.


Next up is packaging: The apieu are packaged in small cylindrical containers with a holographic design. The only way to tell the color is by a small sticker at the bottom. I really hate it when shades are packaged identical, and I have brought the wrong shade with me when I’m in a rush because of this, which is always a let-down. The romand one is packaged in a slimmer and taller cylindrical tube than the apieu, and the color of the packaging is the same as the shade inside. It also has the shade written on the side of the tube. While it’s nothing ground-breaking with the packaging of the romand, I do prefer it because of the practical reason of easily seeing the shade I’m picking. 


Now for the price; I get these on eBay and the Romand costs DOUBLE the amount of the A’pieu. I find it to be a little bit better in every way, but if that justifies such a big price difference is up to you.


Conclusion: Romand is the clear winner for me, as it’s better than the A’pieu in every way. It is, however, only a little bit better - and costs A LOT more. For the price, the A’pieu is such a wonderful product, and I use it a lot. I would almost say it’s a cheaper «dupe» of the Romand. If you’re on a budget you’ll definitely be happy with the quality you get for such a cheap price! If you’re someone who doesn’t mind spending a little on a good quality product however, I would say Romand is the way to go.",1568563493.0,0.89,7

Hair product that can weigh down your hair without frizziness,"Hi everyone! I noticed that Asian women have beautiful hair and it always weigh down beautifully without looking frizzy. I am not sure if that's just genetics, but is there any AB hair product that is popular in Asia? I tried a lot of western hair products and have never found any hair product that would make my hair fall down. I have really thick hair but it's frizzy and I look like a triangle with my hair :D If there is a product that I HAVE to buy and try, please recommend it! Thank you :)

**EDIT**:  When I was a kid, I had curly hair. Now it's wavy, but sometimes it is completely straight if I comb my hair while blow drying it. It is very thick, dry, without shine (since I was a teenager, every hairdresser has been asking me why hair lacked shine). I rarely use straightener and a curling iron (I use them once in two or three months), and I started dying my hair in August last year (I dyed my hair for the first time in my life in August 2018, and second time in May 2019, and that's it.

"What products are your HG for soothing inflamed, red, irritated skin from acne?","Hey guys, what I love about products from AB is how soothing they are! I have hormonal acne and I get really bad cysts on my jawline and a lot of the products I use really help with it! 
Here is my HG calming lineup for when I have a raw, picked (Happens sometimes :[) irritated spot or my skin is just angry in general. 

Products: 

SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica - This stuff... is amazing. I mix it with my essence and I find that it just makes redness go away. It lasts a long time too. I have had this since December and have 1/4th left. I use it twice a day. 

Klairs Unsented Supple Prep - I am on my 5th bottle of this. This stuff is non irritated, so gentle and when I put it on, I can feel a soothing relief and my skin is like ""Ahhhh thank you"". 

I put this stuff on my BF who got badly sunburned (He didn't apply sunscreen on his neck..) mixed with the Skin1004 Centella and he found this more soothing then aloe. 

Stratia Fortify (Not sure if this counts as AB or not) - I add two drops of this mixed with cameilla oil and tamanu oil and my skin just soaks it up. 

Stratia Liquid Gold - Holy grail for repairing. Never makes my skin sting. 

Dr.Trouble Sheet Mask - HG HG HG sheet mask. Sometimes after I take off my makeup, if I have a raw spot that I picked, putting this on instantly soothes it. I leave it on for an hour or two with a sheet mask cover on it (Might be too long.. but it works) and I find that the redness and irritation of my skin subsides. God I love these, I have gone through two packs of them. I always keep them stocked.

Packaging waste and reusing containers,"How do you guys cope with the massive amount of waste produced by the beauty industry. What’s your small part? For me I use a lot of trial sized beauty products, obviously this produces more waste than full sized products do. To compensate for this I tend to save most of my containers to reuse later. I decant my favourite products into their travel sized containers — I clean them with hot water and soap and make sure they dry fully before refilling. I wash them every time I empty them to avoid bacteria as best as I can. So far so good I’ve been doing this for two or so years. I also will save all of my Korean mist bottles to use for literally anything because they always have a beautiful fine mister. Even for making banh mi bread, the tiny mister is the bomb! Even things like laneige or innisfree jars (I can’t recycle innisfree in my area as I don’t have a store close by) I try to use again as planters for small plants. I recycle as much as I can but after seeing some exposées on Canada’s exporting of garbage I don’t fully trust the garbage disposal system to recycle properly. What are some tips you guys have to ease my conscience and avoid excess waste?
Édit: another great idea is to reuse the bubble wrap that comes with your order! I’ve been carefully untaping them and rolling the bubble wrap like a fresh roll from Canada post.

I do not break out but I do have insanely large pores and a generally red, patchy face. AHA, Retinol (OTC, not prescription), sleep packs, sheet masks, 10-step routines, ""minimalist"" routines, double cleanse, 7-skin - any and all combinations of said products and routines - have done 0 for my skin in terms of how it looks. I can even not remove my makeup the night before and still wake up and my skin looks exactly the same...

I do realize that many people would be happy to have my skin (and I am very grateful for it), and a huge portion of skin care has to do with prevention. I guess I'm just frustrated about how it seems like I'll never get even, poreless skin, and I'm wondering if anyone else has ever felt like this.

[Review] MISSHA Near Skin Madecanol cream review (long)," I originally was going to make this a part of my huuge post on AB skincare, but honestly this cream has impressed me so much I decided to make its own post.  


I found this suggestion after doing tons of searching regarding centella asiatica..  
I was interested in concentrations of madecassoside of at least 0.1% -- there's studies showing it (coupled with 5% vit c for efficacy) supports cell turnover/collagen reproduction for added benefits of anti-aging, fading PIH, and of course the usual supporting the wound-healing type of environment, supporting general skin health and barrier function.   


I prefer to not have fragrance or EO. The most popular choice if you search for 0.1% madecassoside is A'Pieu's Cica Gel or Cica Cream. One has a really long ingredient list and another has essential oils, which I was willing to try anyway - but several reviews on ScA and AB reddits proved that not many seemed to like it. I came across this one, and tbh I don't remember where I saw someone says it has at least 0.1% (i read sooo many...)

&#x200B;

 **Skin issues/type:** naturally oily, tons of CCs & blackheads, big pores, big SFs, i don't think dehydrated bc a lot of moisture just clogged me & I was still oily. I went through 2 tubes of Differin, and am now on Tret like 3months in at 0.01% daily.   
My skin is now flaking nonstop and slightly drier but still oily & now sensitive to /something/, not sure what, but my favorite Cerave baby lotion burns like hell.   
It's not silicone, maybe high concentrations of fatty alcohols + butylene glycol. Less blackheads & SFs and pores seem smaller, & I'm slowly re-introducing peels, exfoliant toners, and vitamin C.  

&#x200B;

 **Goals:** I've been working hard to minimize + reduce cost while ensuring I don't overclog my pores, but ensure to completely hydrate my face enough that I keep my embarrassing Tret flakes away buy I'm not an oily or shiny mess. Yeah, ridic. The ONLY thing that had worked was several layers, a thick matte moisturizer like TO's NMF or cerave in tub, and Vanicream lotion last as occlusive, which is matte or satin-drying that's mostly petrolatum. (love that stuff.) 

 **If you want the meat, start here, pass GO & collect $200:**  


***Appearance:***  I got the cream in maybe 1.5 weeks from iHerb. They offer free domestic at $20, so you could buy two tubes and be set if in the continental US, & maybe Canada? It's 50mL and an aluminum or metal tube of some kind. The look is minimalist, kinda like CosRX or Glossier or DE, all white, almost looks like a pharmaceutical ointment (which I assume is the point, considering the ingredients list & lack of fragrance, it basically is.)   


***Skinfeel:*** I'd say it's the most perfect example of a gel-cream I've felt. It's very smooth, almost emollient and has a nice slip - a small amount goes pretty far. It also looks like plain white, creamy toothpaste when it comes out. If you put on much more than pea-sized or fingernail-sized amount, it'll feel kinda tacky for a while before sinking it.   


I was hoping for a thick moisturizer for at night or ultra-soothing cream for when I use high-strength  
peels,  
I'm over exfoliated, or very flakey from Tret. I wanted this as close to my skin as possible for better penetration of the centella product, so I basically put this on after my thinnest serums/essences and sometimes skipped them specifically to let this sink in more.   


I change my routine with products I've become very used to skin-wise depending on my needs & Tret face.  
If I'm very peely or flaky, my PM would look something like what's at the end of the review.  


This is nice but too many products & time-consuming. **I wanna minimize time, money, & effort but still hydrate my embarrassing flakes from Tret.**  


basically, **Tl;DR** considering this... I've been reducing my routine, sometimes forgoing any other moisturizer or occlusive during the day, which has been the only thing hydrating me enough and keeping away dryness. I also have been dealing with sensitivity from adding in actives while on a strong retinoid. 

&#x200B;

 **I tried the following fr AM, which usually has 1-3 more layers and 1-3 more products:**  


innisfree blueberry pH5.5 cleanser -> (maybe use 7% AHA toner, or a BHA/clay mask) ->1 layer meishoku + 1 layer kiku toners, or 2 layers of kiku ->TO's Niacinamide + zinc in T-zone and along jaw -> Benton aloe propolis -> Near Skin's madecanol cream, let dry 10 mins -> silicone primer + sunscreen  


For PM, I'll include an active and/or Curology, skip the niacinamide serum, and either TO's NMF + HA or cerave in tub, + a petrolatum occlusive, or sleeping pack. I did also test out a few days without another moisturizer at night.  

 **What I observed was:** I accidentally frosted my skin too much from MUAC's stronger strength peel, & applying this religiously was the only that that keep the flakes flat, and when added with an occlusive, completely reduced the redness from the burning of my skin which has resulted in PIH.   


And not only that, but my skin has not been sensitive at ALL from actives. They used to sting a little to quite a bit while on Tret, but my skin seems so soothed, smooth & flakeless. I have ""hardy"" skin - as in, I would sometimes over-exfoliate and exfoliate 2-3 times a day by accident bc my skin would not react until days in a row.   


My skin felt amazingly ""strong"", like my barrier was very well restructured & my skin looked kinda ""glowy"" for the first time, despite the PIH I got from burning myself with the peel, since using this more often.  


I have not changed anything in my routine except I cut out Hadalabo premium toner after 2 tries cause it burned (I'm selling it btw), and have amped up using Kiku or Meishoku instead for extra hydration, and tried reducing the number of items for a few days. I don't think extra positives came from what I cut out bc I used them everyday & my skin really loves them.  

&#x200B;

 So sorry for the long post! I just noticed so many good things I had never experienced before, after spending a lot of money for the past year & half of my skincare journey. I don't see this get much attention, and wanted to boost some awareness.

[PSA] All of you are absolutely gorgeous,"When I first got into skincare, I had this goal of having the “perfect skin.” A skin that was so flawless, you couldn’t see my pores, fine lines, so even toned that it’s almost translucent. I’m sure some of you are guilty of having this thought as well. I tried so hard to achieve this by buying serums, sheet masks, toners, - anything you can think of and from every brand as well. The more I looked in the mirror, the more I became unsatisfied with my looks as well.

Looking back at it now, I feel so ridiculous. I’m supposed to have pores, it’s alright to have redness on my cheeks, a pimple here and there is not going to stop the world from spinning. We are all human. Having these so called “imperfections” are normal.

K-Beauty dupe for Cerave,"[Product Question] 

Hi all, new to AB/K-Beauty products. I currently use Cerave’s Skin Renewing Night Cream; no issues or reactions.

Any suggestions with similar ingredients to Cerave’s SRNC? (fragrance free too!)

Vitamin C + Niacinamide: Which combination is better with regards to face flushing,"Vitamin C and Niacinamide have been found to cause red flushing on the face.  With that information on hand, I see that they both have similar benefits.  My question is what combination of use would give you the most benefit?  


Vitamin C ( L-**ascorbic acid** ) in the morning and Niacinamide (**Ordinary 10%**) at night

or

Niacinamide: Morning and Night

or 

  
Vitamin C: Morning and Night  


The thought process behind these different scenarios is using the more powerful serum two times a day would be better then the powerful one and the weaker one of the two, since they have similar skin benefits.  Would that be a fair assumption?  Or is the red facial flushing by mixing both on both morning and night, a minor consequence with a long term greater benefit?",1568047196.0,0.84,23

[Guide] Cica Products With All 4 Centella Triterpenoids/Patented Centella Extracts,"Extracts of Centella Asiatica can be present in skincare in a number of different forms:

* Centella Asiatica Extract, which is powder or liquid extract from the plant
* Centella Asiatica Leaf Water, which is a highly dilute extract created by soaking centella leaves in water
* individual extracted triterpenoids (the phytochemicals in centella that are responsible for most of its beneficial effects) i.e. **madecassoside**, **asiaticoside**, **madecassic acid**, and **asiatic acid**
* patented combinations of any of the above.

Centella is effective at very low concentrations; even just 0.1% madecassoside has noted effects on the skin. However, it can be hard to tell exactly how much centella is included in product due to labelling laws, which (in both Korea and the US) allow ingredients under 1% to be arranged in any order. In addition, Korean products may order ingredients based on the total amount of the extract added to the formula rather than the individual ingredients in the extract. For example, even if the extract only contains 0.01% centella and is 99.99% glycerin, if you used 5% of that liquid in your serum, you would list the extract in the ingredients list as a 5% concentration. In contrast, in the US, individual sub-ingredients in an extract are ordered based on their individual concentration in the total formula. So you'd likely have glycerin at the top of the ingredients list and centella near the bottom.

To make things even more confusing, extracts can vary in strength based on extraction technique, the amount of the true plant extract included in the liquid by the manufacturer, and the season and location of the centella harvest.

I really wanted a product with all four triterpenoids included (as they all have slightly different effects, apparently?) and/or a known, patented extract. The two extracts I focused on:

* **TECA** (titrated extract of centella asiatica), which is a patented powder extract consisting of 40% asiaticoside, 30% madecassic acid, and 30% asiatic acid. Many of the studies on centella have used TECA in their experiments. It is an extremely pure extract (95% triterpenoids) so what you see is what you get, pretty much. If you see asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid listed in a formula sans madecassoside, it probably contains TECA (or possibly a similar extract made by a competitor called Plantactiv).
* **Supercentella** is a newer liquid patented extract consisting of all 4 major centella triterpenoids - madecassoside, madecassic acid, asiaticoside, asiatic acid. I am not sure if it's 25:25:25:25 ratio or not. It is dissolved in water and butylene glycol, and is recommended to be added to formulas at 1-10% per the manufacturer.

The following products either contain TECA/Plantactiv, Supercentella, or have all four triterpenoids in their formula but don't state which specific extract was used. Most of these also contain additional Centella Extract and/or Centella Leaf Water. I excluded products with fragrance, citrus extracts, and EOs (other than tea tree oil).

* **Sioris A Calming Day Ampoule** \- 2% Supercentella and 1% Centella Extract.
* **Sidmool Cicaheals Cream** \- 0.9% TECA + 0.2% madecassoside
* **Sidmool Good Spot Ointment** \- 1% TECA + 0.5% madecassoside
* **Sidmool Centella Lip Essence** \- contains TECA + madecassoside (0.5% total)

* **Sidmool Dr Troub Mild Toner and Zinc 25% Ampoule** \- TECA
* **Sidmool Macenna 115 Ampoule** \- 1% Madecassoside + 1% TECA
* **Skin&Lab Medicica line** \- contains all 4 triterpenoids.
* **skin1004 Madagascar Centella ampoule** \- contains TECA
* **Purito All-in-One Mild Pad**  \- contains TECA.
* **Purito Unscented Sunscreen** \- contains Supercentella.
* **Cosrx AC serum, spot cream, and toners** \- contain TECA.
* **Dr.G Red Blemish Clear Cream** \- all 4 triterpenoids.
* **Etude House SoonJung Sleeping Pack** \- all 4 triterpenoids.
* **Tosowoong Cica Repair Cream Madecare Ointment** \- has 400mg ""centella quantitative extract"" per the KFDA, which I believe is TECA.
* **so natural Madecare Ointment** \- I'm 99% sure it's the same as the Tosowoong ointment.
* **Crazyskin Tica Ample** \- contains all 4 triterpenoids and I seem to remember the Korean advertising saying it contained Supercentella, but I can't remember for sure.
* **Centellian24 Hair Tonic & Hair Loss Shampoo** \- both contain TECA

Favourite Asian Beauty Primer for makeup longevity?,"I was someone who didn't believe that primers made much of a difference until recently when I received a sample size of the Hourglass Mineral Veil primer.

I would just buy that primer but it is crazy expensive so am looking for some AB alternatives. 

I have heard that the VDL primer is a dupe for the Hourglass but I am unsure if it is the Lumilayer or the Satin Veil people are referring to? Logic tells me it is probably the Satin Veil?

Cheapest place to buy Biore UV Aqua Rich Sunscreen? (or alternatives?),"I never really liked using sunscreen and then one of my friends introduced me to this sunscreen and since it makes my face really soft and non-greasy, I’ve been using it whenever I know I’m gonna go outside. I know it’s kind of basic and overrated, but I don’t know any other ones that are similar in its effect. 

I bought two of the Biore UV from eBay and they were good, one from an Asian beauty store, but the most recent two I got from eBay were undoubtedly off-brand and too cheap for actually good products. It arrived in a crinkled package, the sunscreen itself was sticky, too watery while the real one is gel-like. I feel like most of the cheap listings and potential fakes have the same packaging with the aqua rich in the same font. (link below) 

I live in Sydney so while it’s not always hot, it’s always dry. 

So, are there any places or sites that sell it for cheaper than like AUD$25 each? (I live in Australia so shipping is a lot sometimes, especially from Amazon). Or alternatively, any other sunscreens you can recommend that aren’t greasy?

My skin after almost a year with Asian beauty,"Skin Type: Dehydrated, acne-prone, very clog-prone. Sensitive to fatty alcohols, mineral oil, most coconut derived products, silicones (at night in moisturizers - oddly during the day in my makeup it has been fine).

I have had acne about 8 years now. I've tried differin, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin phosphate, azelaic acid, sulfur, tea tree, aloe, dietary changes, birth control - basically everything short of accutane. The original photo was taken last August - I was just using garnier micellar water, epiduo, and rosehip oil. My moisture barrier was non-existant, my skin was irritated, inflamed and full of acne, although it was somewhat controlled by the epiduo.

Current routine:

My skin is far from perfect right now! But it is so so so improved due to this routine. I also cut out diary and eggs and decided to eat low-sugar to see if it helped - and it absolutely has! My breakouts are a lot easier to control with this routine.

AM:

* Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water (non-AB)
* Sukin Hydrating Mist Toner (non-AB, but really looking for an AB replacement)
* Cosrx Snail Mucin 96 Essence on wet skin
* Benton Aloe Propolis Gel (sometimes several layers)
* Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Spf 50+

PM:

* Bioderma Sensibio Micellar Water
* Innis Free Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser
* Sukin Hydrating Mist Toner
* Cosrx Snail Mucin 96 Essence on wet skin
* Epiduo Gel
* Benton Aloe Propolis Gel (sometimes several layers)
* The Ordinary Rosehip Oil (non-AB)
* A few times a week I also add in Mediheal Nmf Aquaring Ampoule Mask which is great for moisturizing.

My future skin care goals are to help reduce the acne scarring, and find a hydrating moisturizer and toner that work for my skin. But I wanted to post now because I'm so grateful to this forum for all the help and really I don't think my skin would be where it is now without the things I've learned about here. So thank you !

Can anyone confirm if Jiinju skincare is a UK company masquerading as Korean?,"I got a few of their sheet masks when they were on sale in Woolworths. I'm from Australia. A few weeks ago, upon applying their avocado one, I realised it was incredibly oily even hours after. I have dry-combo skin. At more than double the price of Korean mask sheets I could get online ($4\~ for full price $2 half-price), I assumed it would be high quality. There is NO way Korean skincare would be this bad.

I used their Apple mask today. It claimed to be ""Super refresh(ing)!"", with a cute panda mascot holding a pink apple. It stayed on my face for 12 minutes. I couldn't keep it on for longer. The smell was SO artificial, and I got 2 pimples, and 2 pink spots (no whitehead). PLUS a rash along the lower-right side of my face after an hour. Something is definitely wrong. I have never reacted to any Korean masks before. It also didn't feel refreshing. I could barely find any reviews on this company, and when I did, all the girls had British accents. Is this a sign?

So, my panicked question is, is it a fake Korean product made by a UK company? (Like Miniso pretending to be Japanese?)

My plastic surgery experience and results in Korea (6 week post-op review),"[https://ibb.co/BtVhhBk](https://ibb.co/BtVhhBk)

44 days post op with natural lighting: https://ibb.co/z8dHtrR

Hi everyone happy labour day. I am approaching 6 weeks post-op after getting rhinoplasty and brow lift and hairline reduction at Namu clinic. And posting this to help anyone else interested in Namu or surgery in Korea in general. And give some info about male plastic surgery in Asia which is harder to find posts on. Please ask me any questions and I'll answer then to the best of my ability. 

NGL I wrote ALOT of bullshit and venting here and most of you don't want to read that so the images pretty much explain themselves and tldr I am 20 years old and 75% Chinese 25% white and had a generally positive experience in seoul and waiting on swelling and final results to settle as I'm not content with the results yet and hope it changes in the coming months. 

**No stigma against male surgery in Korea**

Anyway, for starters, I am also posting this as I want to shed light on male plastic surgery, especially Korean Plastic surgery for males which does not seem to be much info on around here and I know there are other western Asians like myself who might want some information. In Korea, cosmetic surgery for men is pretty common but in the West, there is stigma and judgment towards men who want to get cosmetic surgery. Both men and women can benefit from surgery.

**The trip and finding Namu**

I never liked how large my forehead was and how stubby my nose was and since I am transferring to a new university this year I told myself this was the time. I only told my mother and my girlfriend and nobody else then headed to Korea for two weeks. Getting off the plane and finding all by myself away in a foreign country with credit cards that refused to work and barely knowing the language or how public transit worked and horrible reception was very intimidating not to mention I had 4 consultations lined up the day I got there. I never even took Namu seriously and was even considering just dipping my consultation with them as I was really tired and wanted to rest before going out but after seeing they were a 5-minute walk from my hotel in Gangnam-Daero I decided to go. Their clinic is pretty small and is in SeoCho-Gu near the Samsung HQ and next to Gangnam station. I talked to their English consultant Linda who was very nice and really pretty. She recommended Browlift, Forehead reduction and open rhino for 9.6 million KRW which included a discount of letting them use my B/A's. I also got tax free money back at incheon of around $650. She seemed pretty honest too by telling me not to get things she did not think I should get whenever I mentioned them. She also offered and gave me free fillers which in hindsight was probably just to further convince me to lock down a deposit. Two days later I got the surgery with Dr. Kirk and stayed overnight and 2 weeks later I left Korea. 7 days they removed the cast for my nose and 10 days they took stitches out of my forehead. These removal days were pretty painful. They gave me lots of deswelling treatments and a 2-year warranty for any revisions. That's enough storytime though I am sure most of you are more interested in the actual results and if you have any questions about the process feel free to ask me.

**What I did after** 

Tbh people don't care or stare at you for wearing a mask and id recommend walking as much as possible to avoid swelling not to mention Korea is a wonderful and beautiful country where traditional culture meets modern technology and should be on everyone's bucket list. The seoul metro is great for going around and very cheap but I'd recommend taxi when doing your consultations as you won't be as familiar with Korea on your first days and it will be faster for your schedule. Id also advise getting arnica and drinking pumpkin juice and Korean tofu seaweed soup to help swelling end. And avoid most spicy and salty foods. 
Some places I went to: 
-National Korean museum 
-national Korean war museum 
-Seoul N tower 
-Bukchon Hanok village 
-Changdeokgung
-Yongsan Gu for its tech malls and arcades 
-Namdaemun for its malls and traditional markets 
Hongik for its nightlife and college town life to hang out with Korean American friends who were in Korea at the time 
Myeong dong was very Foreigner friendly and had the highest concentration of tourists and English speakers within it's high end shopping districts American and European shops like nike Adidas etc have exclusive Korean only merchandise you may want to pick up 


**Results: (and kind of a vent lol)**

(I also got double eyelid surgery and dark circle removal done at View, but this post is not really about that as I am covering my eyes for privacy and this post is about Namu and double eyelids take longer to heal and look natural anyways)

I am 20 years old and am North East Chinese and 25% English. This concerned me as I am not ethnically Korean but many foreigners both Western and Asian come to Korea and North East Chinese is genetically pretty close to Koreans anyways.  I'd be lying if I said I was not worried if they would know how to make my face look good since I am mixed race and have a unique face and all their really good B/A's and expertise seems to be in indigenous Koreans or at least full East Asians. If I was white though I think I would have done it in the States since Koreans are used to and expertise with thick Asian skin and their beauty standards are different.  Though many Russians and Americans go to Korea and end up very happy with their results.

**Feeling alright with results so far but it is 6 weeks in.  I have to be patient.**

How do I feel 6 weeks later? Well, I won't lie I am actually not that happy. While they did do a pretty good job, I did notice some uneven swelling and I wish my nose was thinner and less pointy and I don't really feel that much more attractive despite my only objective flaws of a flat nose and large forehead being gone and technically having all boxes checked off now. I feel like while my side profile is far different, my face from the front does not look much different and my nose feels too wide still unlike the photoshopped image.  Dr. Kirk said I had really tough skin and he had a hard time working on it but I hope my final result is skinny like the photoshopped image.  I mean that guy did do a good job! I just feel weird with a different face and waiting for the final result.

However, I am only 6 weeks in and still have lots of recovery and deswelling to do and came off medication and my hair is an absolute mess and really long right now which is skewing my perception of mine attractiveness. It is just weird because while they did an amazing job and my nose and forehead itself look objectively good themselves, my overall face for some reason does not seem more attractive and for some reason, I expected to look really drastically and attractive from all drastic Korean B/As I have seen. It is natural to have doubts at this stage though.

On the forehead side of things, the top of my head feels really numb lol.  Overall I am more confident now and stop styling my hair like Justin Bieber to cover my large forehead.  Though I have lots of scars left as you can see and I possibly think they should have made it even lower but I am not sure. (They did 2 CM).  I heard some people had issues with brow lift but I cannot see any scars or incisions on my brow lift and I think they did a good job. My only worry though is that it does negatively affect my double eyelid results as they are both eye area related things and the main reason Linda recommended brow lift was that my eyelids were very droopy and hooded.  That was good but I was also said fuck it and did double eyelid surgery at View too since it seemed like a safe bet since it is very common and cheap in Korea.

At the beginning like a week post-op, I wasn't so happy with my results but I knew they would change drastically. Well 6 weeks in and I still am not happy as I hoped it would look thinner and a lot better by now. I am only 1.5 months in and need to wait 3-6 months though (1.5 months longer) which I am perfectly fine doing it is just that I am worried how **much** my nose will change from now to the 3-month mark as it seems like most people are happy with their results within 2 weeks and by 4 weeks it seems 80% of the final result seems to set in place for most people.  Overall I am still glad I went to Namu and think I made the right choice as a great *majority* of their reviews is positive.  Many of you will tell me it is too early but lots of people seem to be pretty happy with their results within 2-4 weeks, not to mention by 6 weeks 75% of swelling and final result should be there anyway so I am not sure how much will change because I was already told a month ago when I was only 4 days post-op it would change a lot in just a couple weeks.  (It has changed significantly since then but not enough that I would be happy with) II originally wanted to go to cocoline and had my heart set there (in fact they made the photoshopped images) but they do not do hairline lowering.

I've been quite depressed about not liking my results and not thinking I got more attractive but I should remember this was to fix flaws I did not like and I did it for myself and to be happy, not to look better for other people.  It just seems so weird that despite my nose and forehead being fixed and looking good which were my only two facial feature flaws I fixed, I do not feel more confident and my overall face seems not that much better looking then how I started.  And they did do an objectively good job I'm pretty sure and I should not be worrying this early.  But I am already 6 weeks in and final results are supposed to show by 3 months and I am not sure how much of a difference there will be by then. Not to mention I also did double eyelid surgery too which takes a longer time to recover and might be changing my opinion of my nose as a result since my eyes look pretty swollen still.

While they made my nose better it doesn't really look like the photoshopped image and I really doubt any more deswelling and time will make my nose currently look like the one in the photoshopped image. I guess I should wait longer but I already waited a month and a half and my nose doesn't really look skinny or slim like the photoshop pic nor do I think any amount of waiting or deswelling will make it look better like the photoshopped image. 

**P.S. Double eyelid surgery**

You cannot see it obviously since they are covered but I feel like my really swollen and still healing double eyelid surgery might be putting off the rest of the work.  It takes longer for double eyelids to look natural. So, of course, the results look better here in these images but in reality look worse as my eyes seem to be dragging down the rest of my face and other surgeries as it is taking a long time to heal.   But I guess it is good to cover my eyes here for not just my privacy but as I get a more fair assessment on my nose and hairline operation without my super unattractive and swollen eyes possibly making me look worse which indirectly makes my other operations look worse.

I am also not sure if larger eyes are even more attractive for males too or if I even really needed double eyelid surgery, to begin with.  But that is a whole nother topic for another post.

[News] Update on Changes to Cosmetic Regulations in China,"Good news for lovers of ‘cruelty free’ cosmetics. China’s much awaited update to their Cosmetic Supervision and Administration Regulation \[CSAR\] is predicted to come into place by the end of 2019 and the new regulation does away with compulsory animal testing for most cosmetics.

The National Medical Products Administration \[NMPA\] released a draft of ‘Filing Non-Special Use Cosmetics’ in May 2019. The draft states that non-Special Use Cosmetics will be exempt from animal testing, subject to certain conditions. These conditions include that the products must be manufactured under certain Good Manufacturing Practices \[GMP\] with a proven product safety. However, the product must undergo toxicity testing if the cosmetic product is

\- for infants or children 

\- if the product includes ingredients not listed in the IECIC

\- if the manufacturer or responsible person has not been clear of supervision, investigation or punishment in past three years. 

Other key changes to the CSAR include;

· the definition of ‘Cosmetics’ is extended to include non-externally applied cosmetics, for example, oral care.

· It defines Special Use Cosmetics in five categories; hair dye, hair perms, skin whitening, sun-screens and any new cosmetic claims

· Special Use and Non-Special Use Cosmetics will require a Safety Assessment. 

· Proof of Efficacy will be required from literature and test reports.

The regulation goes further with regards to new Ingredients, which will require pre-market registration. All new CSAR ingredients classified as ‘high risk’ will require regulation and approval from the \[NMPA\]. Only once these new ingredients have been observed for three years, and remain free of safety concerns during this period, can they be included in the Inventory of Existing Cosmetic ingredients in China \[IECIC\]

**What will be the impact of this new regulation?**

Well, brands that already follow a wholly ‘cruelty free’ ethos will be able to market their products into China. Brands that have followed a ‘cruelty free’ ethos across the US and Europe but have been forced to carry out animal testing on final product formulations, to comply with regulation for China, will now be able to have consistency across the globe. 

The ECIC has only introduced ten new ingredients in the last 10 years and has not been updated since 2015. The update will extend ingredient choses to brands, hopefully leading to new innovative formulations.",1567419354.0,0.96,23

Comparison review between peripera airy ink Velvet and 3CE Velvet lip tint,"There are so many lip tints these days, and a lot of different brands are releasing products with similar formulas. I hope some of you may find this comparison useful if you are thinking about buying one or the other. Also let me know if you want me to do another one with different products :)



PERIPERA AIRY INK VELVET V.S 3CE VELVET LIP TINT


I have the peripera in the shades «glimpse brick brown» and «elf light rose» and 3CE in the shades «taupe» and «near and dear». So first of all, the shades: the 3CE ones are both true to the official swatches on me, which is awesome. The peripera, on the other hand, are nothing like the swatches. Elf light rose, which appears to be a mlbb muted pink, is a bright pink on me, and glimpse brick brown, which is a darker brownish red on the official page, is a light nudish brown on me. That said, I still do like the colors on me, they’re just not what I was expecting. Apart from that both brands have a good color selection, but I personally prefer the more muted colors of 3CE. 


Next up is smell: the 3CE ones smell like vanilla. I personally like the smell, and it is not overpowering in any way. The smell is consistent across all shades and does not linger. Now for peripera, each shade seems to have their own smell. Elf light rose smells like soap, and I absolutely hate it. I also feels it lingers for a while after application. Glimpse brick brown, on the other hand, smells like gummy Bears or some other kind of candy. I personally like the scent of it.


Now on to the formula: both have a sort of silicone-y feeling on the lips, which is why I think they are comparable. The peripera ones glide on really smoothly and covers all my lip lines. They are very opaque and I only need a little bit to cover my natural lip color completely. They feel really light on my lips, and are comfortable to wear. They last a decent amount of time and fade evenly. None of the 2 colors leave a noticeable stain behind on me. These do however feel quite drying on me after a while. It’s nothing horrible, but they don’t give my lips any moisture at all and just sort of «sit on top» of my lips like a film. The 3ce are also opaque and give a nice and even coverage, but because the applicator picks up very little product at a time I do find myself having to go over my lips more than once to build up the color I want. These feel even more like nothing on my lips than the peripera ones, and I sometimes forget I have something on at all! They last longer than the peripera, and leave a muted stain behind when they fade, and they fade evenly. Best of all is that these actually feel moisturizing on my lips! Even after I have had them on for quite a while they don’t feel drying at all, but they do show lip lines more than the peripera ones.


Packaging and price: the peripera are packaged in cute little plastic bottles that resemble pots of ink. The 3ce ones are in a slim and tall cylinder container that are colored according to the shade inside. I personally prefer the packaging of 3ce as I find it sleeker and it doesn’t take up as much space as the bulkier peripera. I also find it easier to see the shade from the packaging alone, which is always a plus. Regarding price peripera is the clear winner, as the 3CE ones are quite pricey for an ab lip product. I do however find that the price is justified for what you get.


My winner is definitely the 3CE Velvet lip tint, and I already have more shades on the way!",1567363862.0,1.0,6

The taste fades.  Has a honey smell.   This is superior to the Laneige, as it is more moisturizing,  some honey like texture added  and it is soothing.   I find these kind of balms great when your outer lips are a bit sore or burnt from spicey food. Calms that down.  Has to be reapplied though. Tube doesn't last that long.  . .  **(like this, except taste)**

Not as effective as it's lighter but that might appeal more to others as it's not very sticky.   Slightly slippery feel of the tube one, but lighter. Still soothing.  I feel the stick might last longer, but prefer the one in the tube. (**Not wowed but fine)**

**Mommy for my dear Kiss Me lip Cream** ([https://www.yesstyle.com/en/isehan-kiss-me-mommy-lip-cream-fragrance-free-3-5g/info.html/pid.1025666949](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/isehan-kiss-me-mommy-lip-cream-fragrance-free-3-5g/info.html/pid.1025666949)  This feels very creamy on and did work well for me and lasted longest.  Feels a bit like shea butter.   Comes in Strawberry and unscented (what I got).  The unscented which I tried has no taste or smell.   This lasted a bit longer for me. Helped over drying lip tint. . It keep my lips from bothering me. Only a bit of of taste. No smell. Didn't soothe like the honey ones.  Gave some longer lasting moisture and and taste lake of chemical taste is nice.  (**This holds up well but is not as soothing)**

**Hada Labo Super Hyaluronic Lip Balm SPF 15** ([http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic\_1d2b399151.html](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_1d2b399151.html))  This is very light and hydrating feeling. Has a cooling almost wet well but also a petroleum feel. No or very little  taste or smell. Very fun to use but doesn't that long. Feels more hydrating that really coating.  Slightly cooling. Like soft petroleum with lots of HAs.  Has some SPF. **(pleasant hydrating feel, but not long lasting)**

**Hanyul Lip Balm, Pure Artemisia (**[**http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic\_9f54336641.html**](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9f54336641.html)**) -**Artemisia may only be only a scent and is one choice out of 5 other flavors. Smells sort of lemony and slightly herbal.  Not that good. Waxy seal but nothing very lasting. Slight chemical taste. This doesn't do anything for me and is tiny bit irritating. **(did not do much for me)**

**\[Banana Boat Sport Performance Broad Specrum SPF 50\](**[**http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic\_08bc328704.html**](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_08bc328704.html)**)** this is mild taste (orange?) and feels like a regular chapstick but not drying.   Water resistant. If you want SPF for the lips, this is very good and not unpleansant or weird tasting to use. It is moisturizing as well. **(this is pleasant for a lip SPF)**",1567188770.0,1.0,2

[News] New website with multiple luxury AB brands (western too) at a steep discount called Akira Beauty,"I was looking around for discounts on Sulwhasoo and I found a new website called Akira Beauty via google.

I can't find a whole lot on them, but they seem pretty new; nothing comes up on this subreddit when I search for Akira. There are a few websites that have write-ups about them from back in March (e.g., [Bustle](https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-akira-beauty-this-new-e-commerce-site-sells-luxury-brands-at-up-to-40-off-16813525) and [HelloGiggles](https://hellogiggles.com/beauty/akira-beauty/)).

According to their website, they can offer permanent discounts because they don't have physical stores and don't do a lot of advertising, which is...somewhat true I guess? I hadn't heard of them before, though they did obviously pay for those two articles. Some of the products are around 40% off (e.g., $62 for the 75ml SK-II essence that is $99 everywhere else), and if you sign up for their e-mail you get an extra 15% off.

The AB brands they offer include Shu Uemura, Shiseido, SK-II, Koh Gen Do, and Sulwhasoo. Some have *very* limited selections though. Also, they don't accept used/opened returns...so this company might be best if you already know you like a product.

Has anyone else tried them before? Are they legit? I am so tempted to place a big order!

I am in no way connected to the company. Just hoping you guys don't say it's a scam/they sell fake products!

Fave AB oil cleansers?,"Hi all, I'm in the market for a new AB oil cleanser (can be liquid or solid/balm). Thus far I've tried:

* **Etude House's Real Art Mild Cleansing Oil** (the green tea one): I liked the scent and it did a decent job of cleaning face of sunscreen/base make-up but wasn't the best for eye makeup like waterproof mascara and eyeliner. Still a good budget oil cleanser.
* **Softymo White Cleansing Oil**: bought this in Japan (so cheap there!), and it lasted so long. I actually liked the formula better than the Etude House one, it was a bit thicker and I found it did a better job. Not too strongly scented either. I did notice a blurry/oily film in my eyes after washing my face which went away if I gently dried my eyes with a towel. Might repurchase if I'm ever in Japan again.
* **Tatcha Pure One Step Camelia Oil**: would this be considered an AB product? I know it's a SF-based company but they source their ingredients straight from Japan and their philosophy is based on traditional Japanese beauty. Currently using this and it's AMAZING, definitely my favourite out of the three. It has a nice smell, a little goes a long way, and it washes off so nicely without leaving any kind of oily film around my eyes. The downside? Not a big fan of the extra step of having to pull off the lid/cover and then pump, also, it's hella expensive as are all of Tatcha's products. I actually got a smaller version of this from the Tatcha Bestseller's pack from Sephora, which was a steal. Don't know if getting the full-size would be the most economical option for me since I go through it pretty quickly.

I've recently purchased the Heimish All Clean Balm as I'm trying to give solid oil cleaners a try, has anyone given this a try? Is it any worse/better than the Banila co. Clean It Zero balm which I've heard a lot about?

"［hair］which perm is less damaging to hair? Korean Perm, Steam Perm, S Perm, C Perm?","Hey everyone 

Not sure if this is the right sub for this but...

So I'm planning to get my hair done but it's my first time doing anything drastic(besides rebonding) to my hair(never coloured) and I really like the curls in Suzy's Instagram post : https://www.instagram.com/p/B0skBfQBXW3/?igshid=ryyrajcxbyw1

I was wondering what this type of perm is called? And which should I go for? I'm just afraid my hair would be damaged after the perm and I  don't know which is less damaging ? My hair has always been slightly wavy and usually I tie my hair up in a bun.. so maybe something low maintenance as well? I just have really flat hair at the top..So I was wondering what I should do. Should I not do perming instead?

Any advice would be appreciated thank you! 

Also if anyone is from Singapore, could you guys tell me which salons are good for perming? I usually get my hair trimmed around my neighbourhood for like 12$ so I'm not really knowledgeable on the salons out there..",1567053953.0,0.94,35

Short Review of the Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser,"This shit. My GOD. I found it. I found *it*. 

&#x200B;

Skin type: normal-dry

&#x200B;

This is a low pH cleanser, you don't need much (I always use more than i should at night). Everytime I use it my face is visibily brighter, cleaner, fresher, all those adjectives. This cleanser makes me glow. AND if i have a pimple it's visibly reduced after just one use. The pimple's not gone but it is smaller and after 2 days *it is* gone. This cleanser does not dry me out at allllllll. 

&#x200B;

This is a godsend i need everyone to try it. I was kinda hesitant to try this because most of the reviewers I watched had oily skin but I honestly think any skin type can use this and see results. (I don't have every skin type so could be wrong. Edit: i was wrong) I don't think I'm gonna search for another cleanser like ever. I'm hesitant to call anything a HG but this is my HG.

[Discussion] How does everyone remove the dead skin which hasn't fully come off after chemical exfoliation?,"Hi guys, I've scoured through every post on here, but I wanted to specifically ask how everyone removes the dead skin that builds up on the face after using chemical exfoliants and doesn't fully come off with cleansing. I find that since incorporating a strong AHA/retinol my skin looks great, but my make-up looks kinda patchy because of that extra gunk sitting on top. 

For those with extra flaky skin like me, how do you go about getting rid of those last bits of crap so the skin is smooth? I don't use a physical exfoliator which I'm guessing is the missing piece of my routine, but which type do you guys use - peeling gel, enzyme powders, scrubs?

Although this thread had some good recommendations, some of the recs were for skincare rather than makeup, e.g. toners/sunscreens/etc. There were also some recs for products that I'd consider high-maintenance, such as the Herione Make mascara (many folks say it's very hard to remove and recommend an eyelash primer and/or specialized remover.)

1. It doesn’t contain any rice bits. I noticed that the exfoliating “grains” were actually crystal clear instead of white, like rice would be. I looked up the ingredients, and concluded that the grains are most likely [hydrogenated jojoba oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenated_jojoba_oil) (jojoba that’s been treated with hydrogen to make it into a solid). Nothing bad, but I think it's a little misleading, especially since I've seen people on this sub write about exfoliating with the ""rice grains."" It's not rice.
2. The only rice-related ingredient is rice bran water, listed as the 5th ingredient. If you like the effects of rice water, you could just rinse some rice in a bowl and slap the water on your face (like a toner, as [many people do](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8fr78a/diy_homemade_rice_water_toner/)) for a fraction of the price.
3. It makes my face red. Like reeeal red. If I leave it on for more than 5 minutes like a mask, there’s a clear red line around the perimeter of my face where the product was sitting, and it kinda burns. I don’t get that reaction with any other product I own, and I’m not sure which ingredient or combo causes it. My skin is just not a fan!
4. It’s not even that exfoliating. I feel like the hydrogenated jojoba “grains” don’t actually do much because they’re soft and squishy. My face does feel smoother after using it, but I suspect it’s just because of the fatty alcohols and silicones, and not actually because my face has been exfoliated in any way. It's more of an emollient than anything.
5. It has fragrance. It’s the last ingredient and I’ve definitely smelled worse, but my personal preference is for unscented skincare - my face doesn’t need to smell like fake “fresh laundry” or whatever.
6. It uses 2 types of [parabens](https://www.paulaschoice.com/ingredient-dictionary/preservatives/parabens.html) as a preservative, if that's something you care about - the jury is out on how much exposure you need for them to act as endocrine disruptors, but low doses in skincare are probably safe. \*Edit: As a user mentioned below, it seems to be formulated without parabens now! The cosDNA 2019 entry lists them, but my tub that I bought in 2018 doesn't. Hm.

Soo I’m pretty disappointed that this product turned out to be so underwhelming (especially after paying like $18 for it). I get better physical exfoliation results using plain (and cheap) oat flour or rice flour mixed with a little water in the shower and gently massaging it around.

Thoughts? Love it or hate it?

The store’s pretty big and it looks like they have a decent variety of stuff. Aside from makeup and skincare, I also saw diapers, haircare, bath salts, hair tools, and I think pads too. I mainly looked at the mascaras and haircare and it seems they have quite a few brands I haven’t seen before.

Effectiveness of sun screens.,"I'm really enthusiastic to discuss the effectiveness of sun screens.

There are so many sun screens on the market, and usually we compare sun screens that are spf50 (+).

But there must be differences in effectiveness. There have been many comparison posts where people say one works much better than the other.

All the dermatologists I have watched/spoke with were happy that people were using them at all, and suggest that if you use it correctly (use enough product, reapply when it's time) you are pretty much safe.

So, I am curious to hear if you have encountered any noticeable difference between two spf50 products, for example did you burn with one product but not the other? Or did your skin get darker with one but not the other?

What do you think makes one spf50 sun screen more effective than the other?

What is the science behind the differences in effectiveness between products?

Am I wrong in thinking sun screens are made with the purpose to prevent burning and coloring (tanning) of the skin?

Or are they only made to prevent burning of the skin?

I used to think a sun screen with physical filters (zinc and titanium) would protect your skin more. But now I've used many different sun screens, some with only physical filters, others a combination and others with only chemical filters, I am not so sure anymore.

Do you think physical sun screens provide better protection then combination or chemical ones?

I havent burned this summer, but my face skin has become darker than macw10 (my chest and arms are lighter than w10). I'm not really bothered by the fact that I got a bit darker, because I don't use makeup often, and my skin condition seems really good. But I thought correct usage of sun screen (and I have used diligently and correctly, physical sun screen some days, chemical sun screen other days) would prevent my skin from getting darker.

That's why I was interested in starting the discussion to get to the bottom of the differences.",1566398668.0,0.72,33

Tokyo Central is having a sale on Lululun face masks!,,1566332728.0,0.94,1
[Review] I tried a ton of Lululun masks so you don't have to,"So! I know a lot of people are trying to reduce their waste when it comes to using sheet masks and trying to opt for the larger packages. I've been using Lululun masks for a while, and I thought I'd share the little reviews I wrote of each mask that I tried. I particularly like Lululun because they're a little easier to find, also come in 7-packs that travel well, and because (except for the Plus and Premium lines) they're unscented. I know a lot of people have been looking to try them, too, but the types and how well they work is pretty confusing, so I hope this clears it up and can possibly be seen as some sort of guide?

These reviews have been written over the past year or so, and includes all of the masks (to my knowledge) from the standard, Precious, and One Night lines, plus some of the Premium and one Plus mask. I haven't tried the Lululun One line (they're extremely expensive here--like, T&T wanted $25 for a package?) or any of the standard skincare items like the cleansing balm or creams (since they're not stocked near me and YesStyle wants an arm, leg, and my first-born child for them).

These masks were purchased in the US and Canada, but I'm Canada-based and can't really answer for any sources outside of the ones I bought my masks at. I have dry, redness-prone skin, and my skin pre-mask was generally the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and either The Ordinary's 10% Lactic Acid or Stridex in the red box, since I tend to sheet mask after using acids. 

When I was unsure, what I've said the mask does is generally taken from translations either from [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/), [Don Quijote's worldwide site](https://mpglobal.donki.com/en), or the [Lululun USA website](https://www.lululunusa.com/). While doing these reviews, I also liked looking at the resources from [StarrySkin's Lululun Series](https://starryskin.com/2015/05/11/lululun-sheet-masks-whats-up-with-all-the-damn-colors-part-1/) and [watching SekineRisa's video on all the Lululun masks (Japanese language only)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vahN1yUc4x8). 

Not in order of how I tried them, just organized by type.

**Standard Lululun**

Pink Type (Moisture Balance)

* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at various places over the years--YamiBuy, T&T Market, Amazon, and a local shop that has since closed.

* Like all the regular masks from the Lululun lines, this has no scent, which is nice. After it dries down onto my face, it still feels a little dry? I don't feel moisturized afterwards, though, just like I have something on my face. If you have dry skin, you definitely can't use this as a standalone mask.

* Would I rebuy? It's not my first choice, but I suppose I would if it was the only mask available.

Purple/Blue Type (Deep Moisture) (I think the packaging looks purple, but people call it the blue type.)

* Worn for 20 minutes, also purchased at various places--same as before, plus my first pack was bought at Ricky's in NYC.

* The serum in this mask is noticeably thicker than the pink type. I rebuy this one a lot, especially when I'm traveling, since it works really well when you're going all over the place and your skin is going crazy. I still can't use it on its own for moisturizer, but it's way better than nothing. It has also helped fade some irritated red spots in the short-term.

* Would I rebuy? I have multiple times. It's really good.

White Type (Brightening)

* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased in various places like the others.

* I'm very biased towards this one, since it's my third 32-pack. It's a little moisturizing, surprisingly more than the pink type for me? It's a really good standard everyday sheet mask if you're just looking for that extra layer of moisture and not much else. Like the blue/purple, it also fades some irritated red spots in the short-term.

* Would I rebuy? I have multiple times.


**Lululun Precious** (Anti-aging)

Red Type (Moisturizing)

* Worn for 20 minutes--have purchased at Miniso and a local shop, though I've also seen it in stock on Yamibuy, Amazon, and in T&T.

* Like the standard line, the Precious line has no scents. It's kind of in between the moisture of the pink mask and the blue/purple...not nearly as deep as the blue/purple, but still pretty moisturizing. After taking it off, it feels like I've put on a light moisturizer.

* Would I rebuy? If I can't find the blue/purple or green types, yes. It's good, I just tend to go for the other two.

Green Type (Deep Moisture)

* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at local stores and at L'Amour Beauty in Toronto.

* This mask allegedly has ""L22"", which ""imitates the sebum balance of a 22 year-old"". I'd describe it as a more oily type of moisturizing? After taking it off, it feels like I put on a standard lotion, and it takes a while longer to dry down compared to the other standard masks.

* Would rebuy? Yes, I have a few times already. In terms of moisturizing masks, I'm tied between this one and the blue/purple type for my favourite.

Gold Type (Brightening)

* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at same places as other Precious masks.

* The biggest difference is that this one oddly felt a little cooler on my face? Like the other brightening mask, it faded my red spots a tiny bit, though I wouldn't say there was a noticeable difference. It's still nice to have, though.

* Would rebuy? I have a few times, but I usually only buy the 7-pack for traveling since I feel like it's basically the same on my face as the white type in the standard line.

Precious Eye Masks

* Worn for 15 minutes, purchased at L'Amour Beauty in Toronto.

* First and foremost, I *love* how these masks are packaged. I didn't expect them to be packed like the face masks are--stacked on top of one another--but they are, so it looks like a mini version of the 32 packs of the normal masks. The material is a little thinner than the standard Lululun Masks, but thicker than, say, the Etude House eye patches. The serum dries on your face pretty quickly afterwards, too.

*Would I rebuy? Yes, absolutely! I love how these are packaged and the amount that you get for the price.

**Lululun One Night**

(As a note, One Night masks are all single packages, so if you're looking for multi-use packets, this won't be good for you. They're nice for special occasions, though, which is generally what the package indicates them for.)

Blue (Clarifying)

* Worn for 20 minutes, purchased at L'Amour Beauty in Toronto and also on Yamibuy.

* When I tried this, my face was a wreck. I was sleep-deprived, I had a huge zit on my chin, my face was red for no reason. I was kind of hoping this would help at least a bit...and lo and behold, it did. Lululun One Night masks come with an ungodly amount of serum in the packaging--like, it took ten minutes to dry after I took it off--and it feels great to put on your face, though the material is a little less stretchy than the standard masks. In the morning, my face was actually a whole lot clearer? It cleared up within a few days, and trust me, the outside factors that were making my skin irritated in the first place (cough cough *grad school*) were not getting any better. So, I definitely trust this.

* I would rebuy this and I already have, though I keep it stowed away in a drawer just in case.

Orange (Vitamin C/Brightening)

* Worn for 20 minutes, bought on Yamibuy

* Like the blue one--there's a ton of serum, which means it took approximately 30 years to dry, and while you don't see immediate results, my skin looked *so* much better in the morning. It cleared up some of the red spots on my chin from where I previously had acne, and my face in general was just way brighter.

* I would definitely rebuy this, and I have a few stowed away.

Pink (Moisture)

* Worn for 20 minutes, bought on Yamibuy

* I like this one, but I definitely would need to try it out again in the winter time. It worked great to moisturize my skin, and my skin definitely wasn't as dry in the morning as it can be sometimes.

* Would rebuy? Maybe? It worked out well, but the purple/blue and green work pretty well for the same thing. Maybe if my skin was obscenely dry for some reason.

Gold and Blue (Anti-aging Clarifying)

* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at L'Amour Beauty.

* Personally, this worked about the same as the standard blue One Night for me. I didn't have as much to clear up this time, but it still made my skin feel pretty good afterwards and some of my post-breakout scarring faded again.

* Would rebuy? No, but only because the standard One Night blue mask does the same thing and is easier to find.

Gold and Pink (Anti-aging moisture)

* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at L'Amour Beauty.

* I used this when my skin was going to be pretty wrecked (working 8AM-10PM for four days in a row plus graduating, oof) and God, did it make me at least kind of look like a presentable human being. I did it the night before I graduated, and despite being sleep-deprived, I looked pretty good in my graduation photos, so it must've done something right.

* Would rebuy? No, just because, once again, the standard line is a little more accessible.

Gold and Green (Anti-aging Resilience)

* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at L'Amour Beauty.

* This one was...hard to gauge, since I'm pretty young and honestly, I'm not quite sure what this one is supposed to do? Most translations put this as ""resilience"", but against what? The lady at L'Amour Beauty said it has collagen, but I'm not in the target audience for that part, I think. Either way, it was nice, since my skin looked a lot less exhausted when I woke up the next morning.

* Would rebuy? Probably not, maybe in the future when I actually need anti-aging products.

**Lululun Premium and Lululun Plus**

Lululun Premium Line

* Each mask was worn for 20 minutes, and purchased at various locations--YesStyle, a few local shops, oo35mm, L'Amour Beauty.

* Look, I could type out reviews for each mask I tried, but honestly? They all feel and perform pretty much the same. I tried the Kyoto (green?) tea, lemon, lavender, sakura, peach, watermelon, and strawberry. They all kind of feel like a mildly more moisturizing version of the standard pink Lululun, but with scents attached to them. That's fine, but there's no specific benefit to buying one over the other. If you want to try them, just buy a scent that you know that you like. Also, they don't come in 32 packs, just in multi-packs of the 7 packs, so if you're going for the more environmentally-friendly route, this might not be it.

* Would rebuy? I've rebought the lemon type a few times since I like the scent, but I wouldn't buy the others again, and some I just gave to a friend since I didn't want to finish the packs off.

Lululun Plus Clary Sage ""Aroma Care""

* Worn for 20 minutes, bought at T&T.

* I like the quality of the mask, so let's put that out there. The cotton is thicker, though not as stretchy, compared to the standard masks. If you don't like buying individual mask packs, though, don't buy this, since it's a package with 5 individually-packaged masks. For the life of me, I *cannot stand* this mask. I tried it twice, and I tried to like it, I really did, but the smell is just so overwhelming. It's the equivalent of putting Vick's under your nose--the scent is just there all. The. Time. It didn't do much in terms of moisturizing and soothing, either.

* Would rebuy? Absolutely not. I wound up giving the extra masks out of this box to a friend.

So, that's all the reviews I have! **If you're looking for a tl;dr: I have dry skin and I really like the blue/purple, white, and precious green types. The One Night masks are really nice at doing what they're supposed to do. The Plus masks literally stink, and only buy the Premium types if you like the scent.** If anyone has any questions (besides ""why would you do this to yourself?"", to which the answer is ""God knows""), feel free to ask in the comments!",1566311733.0,0.98,50

"Do you feel like your face changed a lot throughout your 20s? If so, in what ways?","Basically what the question says. I was thinking about this today because of a few different experiences I had within the past couple of months. For example, I recently got carded for entering a rated-R movie (lady needed to check to see if I was 17 or older...). I'm 24. I also have people assuming I just graduated HS, or high schoolers/early undergrad students assume I am the same age as them when hanging out. In a way, I am not too surprised, just cuz I feel like my face has been more or less the same ever since I turned 21?

&#x200B;

But then I also wonder if my own self-perception is way off. For example, my friend and I (she is 23) visited our college town today to eat at this one restaurant, when a big group of freshmen came in. My friend said, ""Omg we are so out of place...there is no way we can blend in here, we look nothing like college students anymore..."" (which is honestly a comment that kinda bothered me....I don't think we look \*that\* old, and I feel like I pretty much look the same as I did in college....plus we only just graduated like last year :/ ). Plus I get people calling me ""ma'am"" and whatnot (which also happened when I was 18/19).

&#x200B;

So basically, I feel like I look the same, but based on the wide array of comments/reactions, I have no idea if my self-perception is objective or not. (sorry for rambling btw...I have no idea if I made sense)",1566275236.0,0.71,27

SO I was severely disappoinT in my beloved CeraVe and other things. HOWEVER, I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/scacjdiscussion/comments/celc5y/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu3j2mw/?context=3) conversation between the OP of that post and someone else:

Whaaat???? Ceramides for skincare was **invented in Korea**?? Idk, should I be surprised ?

And:

>**Neopharm & Amorepacific have their own patented, lab-made ceramides that have been heavily researched.**

&#x200B;

Interesting! I'm able to read some Korean so I looked into this on Korean sites + Korean reviews.

So it looks like [**Neopharm**](http://www.neopharm.co.kr/en/brand/brand_atopalm.do) owns these brands: **Atopalm, RealBarrier, Zeroid, Derma:B.** And [**Amore Pacific** owns many brands](https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands.html), but I have only seen ""ceramide"" products so far in these brands: **Illiyoon, Aestura & Mamonde.**

I was like, why does this sound familiar? Then I realized that I've seen them ranked very high on Hwahae (Korean beauty review & ranking app) many times before!

Neopharm's ceramide technology is called **""MLE""** and Amore Pacific's is **Ceramide PC-102 and PC-104.**

Personally, I like the look of ZEROID & AESTURA, because their products don't seem to contain fragrance. *(Fragrance can be a trigger for very, very sensitive skin types, but it seems the majority of people tolerate it pretty well in their skincare? However, I have seen derms say it can become problematic the longer you use it. YMMV. For what it's worth, I read many reviews from sensitive-skinned folks saying the fragranced ones never bothered their skin & they love it. Many posted pictures of putting the creams on their babies.)* But they're super hard to find online as of now!

From all the reviews I'm reading, these brands and Illiyoon ato products are what is recommended by Korean dermatologists and skin care clinics. I read that some derms recommend these specifically for the ceramides. (In Korea, products for people with skin conditions like eczema and such are called ""ato"" products, assuming short for ""atopic"".)

&#x200B;

(eBay links are from my trusted eBay sellers/ones I bought from before)

All of these have really good ratings due to being in the TOP 100 for their respective categories. They all use the patented ceramides.

This cream has little beads in it that break up when you apply, according to reviewers. Some wondered if it's the ceramide encapsulation technology. A few people were bothered by the ""scrubby bits"" when using it on their face. Cream is apparently slightly heavier than lotion, but still great absorbency.

&#x200B;

* [**Derma:B Daily Moisture Body Lotion**](http://www.dermab.com/main/contents.asp?Mcate=188&Pcate=12) (4.27/5 out of 2,075 Reviews)  **fragranced**

&#x200B;

For the Body section, both [Illiyoon](http://www.apgroup.com/int/en/brands/illiyoon.html) and [B:Derma](http://www.dermab.com/main/) are in the Top 10.

While Illiyoon's ceramide ato lotion & cream are regarded as **body moisturizers**, lots of people commented that they use it on their **face** also. So, good choice for those of us whose budgets may not allow the more pricier options.

Oilier/combo skin types did not like to use it on their face, while the dry & sensitive-skinned folks loved them. No mention of the lotion not working under makeup. I came across 1 review though saying that they experienced pilling when they used the cream under makeup.

Many people emphasized that they like how light and non-greasy these feel, yet very moisturizing. Some oily types said it felt too heavy. Some said during the summer, they felt it doesn't absorb as well (keep in mind that Korea is EXTREMELY humid during the summer though. Like, you would be drenched in sweat as soon as you stepped out of the shower -\_- and you'd just be all sweaty and nasty alllllllllllllllll summer it was dISCUSTING) but they still agreed with other reviewers saying it absorbed well during colder months (it gets really cold & snowy in Korea during winter).

Rave reviews up & down from dry skinned folks. Some drier skinned folks said it's not enough for winter, however. Illiyoon often goes on sale in Korea and people like that they get can it for like, half off. 1 or 2 reviews saying they had some sort of an allergic reaction. As always, YMMV.

I hope this helps some of you!

You don't have to read the below info, but I thought it may be helpful for those of you with damaged skin barriers. My skin used to be severely damaged too so I feel your struggle. T-T

**MORE ON FRAGRANCE** [**FROM LAB MUFFIN BEAUTY SCIENCE**](https://labmuffin.com/mythbusting-vitamin-c-serums-bad/)**:**

>On the flip side to the little rant I had above: **if you aren’t sensitive to fragrance, there’s no compelling reason to avoid it**. There’s a lot in the dermatological literature on fragrance, but that’s because people who go to the trouble of seeing a dermatologist are those who have serious skin issues. It’s estimated that less than 5% of the population will have allergic reactions to fragrance on their skin. It’s great that there are more fragrance-free products available for people with sensitive skin, but for the rest of us, fragrance isn’t an issue (damage from [“invisible inflammation” from fragrance](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/sensitive-skin/_/why-fragrance-free-products-are-best-for-everyone) isn’t supported by any convincing evidence).

&#x200B;

**BARRIER REPAIR SUPERSTAR? UREA:**

I'm particularly impressed by Zeroid's new [5% urea cream](http://www.zeroid.com/main/contents.asp?step1=0&step2=0&Pcate=280&Mcate=284). It also has panthenol, centella, madecassoside, allantoin, bisabolol and physosterols.

Now, there's SO much mumbo jumbo about efficient skincare, but so much of it is marketing bullshit and there are actually **very few** ingredients (compared to everything else out there) that are scientifically proven to REALLY WORK on our skin. As OP mentions in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/cefcir/psa_research_why_most_ceramide_products_are_a_scam/eu354ub/?context=3) thread, urea is a severely underrated ingredient:

>The one thing that comes to mind, actually, is **urea**. **Of all of the ingredients researched for barrier repair, urea probably has the most consistent and longest track record for repairing the barrier.** You see it a lot in pharmacies in Europe. It's not sexy, but it's often very effective - for very impaired skin suffering from everything from eczema and psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis. I'd recommend trying a 5% cream and seeing how that works for you. The bad news is that there are not a lot of options on the US market (which is not bad news if you happen to be somewhere else!).

Urea is a natural moisturizing factor (NMF) that exist naturally on our skin, it's a mild exfoliator in high concentrations, and it's also a penetration enhancer, meaning that it's also used to deliver actives into the skin better. Now, there are a lot of other penetration enhancers, used both in medicine and the beauty industry, such as dimethyl isosorbide (DMI),  isopropyl myristate, propylene glycols/ethoxydiglycol, emu oil/MCTs (fractionated coconut oil or caprylic/capric triglyceride)/other oils, oleic acid (a component in many oils), etc.

But AFAIK, the reason a lot of them work is because they disrupt the skin barrier long enough to deliver the actives (except perhaps, some oils? Oleic acid has been shown to be disruptive tho. Apparently there are studies that show [emu oil](https://gardenofwisdom.com/products/emu-oil) is able to penetrate very deeply into the skin bc of the tiny-ness of the molecules or some shit. Which is why it's used with herbs/medicine a lot). I'm not a derm or a chemist, but from what I've been reading from the [chemistscorner.com](https://chemistscorner.com) forum, **this isn't always a good thing**. But I have not come across anything that says urea may be damaging. Quite the opposite.

(Mineral oil is also another penetration enhancer, and a wonderful, stable moisturizer that will not go rancid like plant oils do **-** [**squalene on your skin oxidizing leads to acne**](https://simpleskincarescience.com/squalene-squalane-oil-review-acne/)**,** also [confirmed by Lab Muffin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKjKDj9plaI) \- coming in close to petrolatum for reducing Trans Epidermal Water Loss. And petrolatum is pretty much irrefutably, scientifically proven to be the #1ingredient in reducing TEWL. Mineral oil feels quite heavy, but it's used a lot as it doesn't have too many other chemicals in it to cause skin reactions.)

For people with eczema who use colloidal oatmeal creams to soothe skin, make sure the active concentration is 1% or higher, not just claimed ""so and so lotion with natural oatmeal to reduce itching!"", because

>[in order to be listed as an active ingredient, it must be included in a formula at a minimum 0.007 percent concentration, or 0.003 percent minimum concentration if combined with mineral oil.](https://www.mydadthechemist.com/reviews/best-oatmeal-eczema-lotions/)

\^I'm not 100% sure what this means, but I just know that this is probably bc mineral oil's ability to help things penetrate.

**Don't confuse** urea with diazolidinyl urea and imidazolidinyl urea btw, which are preservatives.

&#x200B;

**Some moisturizers with urea:**

(I will list 10% ones here, but I personally don't go above 5% because of the exfoliating effects of urea for my face. It may be mild at 10% & below, but I still don't want to risk it as I use a lot of other actives and have problematic skin. But for those who WANT exfoliation and don't get along with AHAs, it may be another option.)

I know Hadalabo Premium lotion is mentioned a lot, but 3% urea is not going to perform as well as concentrations above that (chemistscorner forums). I'm not entirely sure the difference between [Hydroxyethyl Urea](https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/hydroxyethyl-urea) and regular urea is, but some say it's the same thing just different name and some say it functions more as a humectant rather than being skin-identical. Idk. But if you count it, then there are more options, like [Gold Bond Men's Essentials](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-men-s-essentials-hand-face-and-body-lotions-14-5oz/-/A-14507966), or the [Strength & Resilience Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/gold-bond-strength-and-resilienc-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-16453690) and [Unscented Diabetic Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/unscented-gold-bond-diabetic-hand-and-body-lotions-13oz/-/A-15025375) (EDIT: AND [Cetaphil Daily Hydrating Lotion for face](https://www.target.com/p/cetaphil-moisturizing-lotion-unscented-16oz/-/A-10300852)) for fragrance-free options.

I actually have the old version of this, before they reformulated. It used to have 3% colloidal oatmeal!!!!!!!!! Which is higher than any I've seen at the time. It's really thick and is really tacky on my face. It doesn't have a \~nice sillicone-y feel\~. It absorbs all the way by morning tho when I slug life with it.

[Eucerin Body Lotion](https://www.target.com/p/eucerin-advanced-repair-body-lotion-16-9oz/-/A-11005178) \- not sure the %, but it's high

Eucerin has other 5% Urea body lotion, 5% face cream, 5% night face cream (apparently a lot heavier than the day one), and other international versions, but I can't find a non-outrageously priced source of the face cream on eBay. They used to have one at like $8\~11!! It was pretty heavy though if I remember correctly when I used it yeeears back. Maybe I should start putting the 5% hand cream on my face lmao....

[La roche Posay Iso-Urea Body Milk](https://www.laroche-posay.com/products-treatments/Iso-Urea/Iso-Urea-Body-Milk-p7688.aspx) \- Not sure the %, but enough for them to claim that it will help shed the flakes. They have a psoriasis cream with urea as well, but you may not want to use it on the face frequently, because psoriasis products are almost always exfoliating.

It's kind of jarring to read some things from cosmetic chemists discussing stuff, because soooo many of the things I like, totally believed in (and still do??? just bc I've been told so many times that they do) apparently don't have compelling evidence (or just not enough) behind them - like, even panthenol & aloe and such.

Seoul Nail Salons: Unistella or Tam2Na?,"Hello!  I'm heading to Seoul in a few months and while most people would be looking up sightseeing destinations, I'm looking up nail salons (and a whole bunch of other beauty destinations).  I think I've narrowed it down to [Unistella](https://www.instagram.com/unistella_kr/) or [Tam2Na](https://www.instagram.com/nailtam2na/?hl=en).  Both would be great, but I'm only there for 7 days.  Overall Tam2Na's designs seem a bit louder, but wondering if anybody here has been to either?  Saw a few older posts about Unistella here, but none about Tam2Na except a few pics of Girls Generation members over in r/kpop.  Thanks in advance!",1566149812.0,0.86,4

When does facial volume loss tend to start?,"So when it comes to aging, I realized that I don't care for wrinkles as much. I feel like I often see people in their 20s, or even in their late teens with wrinkles, but like, they still look young. I think what really freaks me out though, is the prospect of losing my facial volume, since I feel like *that* is what keeps people truly looking youthful. When does facial volume loss tend to begin? Does ethnicity make an impact? What about life choices (aka how to maintain as long as possible)?",1566116724.0,0.92,12

Just want to share my story and experiences about AB + moving forward.,"https://imgur.com/a/fyfMRRs

Routine:

AM: 
1. Wash face with water
2. Im from Rice Toner, pour onto hand and pat dry on my face.
3. Rohto Melano CC (6 drops, 2 on forehead, 2 of each cheeks)
4. Purito 5% NIACINAMIDE ( Two pumps, spread over my face) 
5. Cosrx 96 snail mucin ( Three pumps, one on each cheeks and one on forehead ) 
6. Klairs rich moisturising moisturiser.
7. Klairs UV essence 

PM:
1. Wash face with Cerave moisturising wash
2. Wishtrend Mendalic Acid
 ( Pour onto hand and pat dry on my face)
3. Klairs midnight drop (the blue serum thingy)
4. Cosrx 96 snail mucin ( Three pumps, one on each cheeks and one on forehead ) 
5. Klairs rich moisturising moisturiser
6. Klairs midnight blue cream ( spread over the face )
Notes:

Occasionally I'll use Wishtrend acid duo at night if I feel the need to. (I noticed that if I was to use that every night, I'll be overcleansing my skin)

I've tried using c21.5 serum, but it oxidised on me way too fast before having noticeably improvements. (Didn't store it in a fridge, willing to try it again in he future.)

I'd say Wishtrend mandelic acid gave me a huge improvement on terms of fading pih/pie and improving skin tone. Though, at a very slow rate.


Unfortunately I haven't been tracking the progress of my skin (I did take pictures on my phone, just to delete it 5 seconds later due to me finding my face repulsive), but just to let you know I had  very bad jawline acne, where there were cysts, black lumps and all kinds of nasty things (which I later found out that dairy was the culprit). Occasionally Ill get acne around my cheeks, with some leaving an indent onto my skin 😭. 

Now I've always had decent skin throughout highschool. I never really cares about my diet or washing my face back then as my skin wasn't as temperamental as it is now.

Fast forward to the adult life, my skin gets acne here and there if I:

- Don't drink enough water
- Having boba 😭
- Too much oily or fried food ( in Chinese we call this ""firey food"" 上火)

It came to a point where I'd wake up every morning, looking at the mirror with disgust. It is then that I've decided to get into skincare and finally take my time to understand and take care of my skin. 

Now I've come a long way since then. I've been using this routine for 2 months now, but started AB a year ago.

Feel free to ask me questions!
Also looking for inputs and opinions from my fellow ABers.  

P.S Currently considering consulting a dermatologist in regards to some minor indents on my cheeks, as the dream is to have that baby skin yo.",1566095178.0,0.95,61

[REVIEW] 3CE GLOW BEAM HIGHLIGHTERS DETAILED REVIEW + SWATCHES,,1566059055.0,0.94,3
"AB 31-Product Mega Review! (ft. Innisfree, Lunasol, SUQQU, Paul & Joe, Etude House, etc.)","[link to album with flatlay and swatches](https://imgur.com/a/Kxb4RT8)    
    
Hello, denizens of /r/Asianbeauty!    
    
I’m Quory, and I moved to Japan in April. Ever since then I’ve amassed a (slightly concerning) amount of makeup and skincare and am finally ready to give my general thoughts on all my acquisitions. 
For reference, my skin is fair, neutral-leaning-warm with normal skin everywhere but my nose which is slightly oily. It tends dry in the winter. I’m not acne-prone but fall victim to the occasional volcano every couple of weeks.    
    
**Skincare and Sunscreen Review**    
    
I’ve been using SKII Pitera Essence for years and SKII Aura Essence since October (both not pictured). I can’t sing enough praises about the combination, as the SKII Pitera Essence leaves my skin soft and moisturized, while the SKII Aura Essence bestows luminosity.    
    
**Cezanne Skin Conditioner High Moist** – ah yes, an AB mainstay that I admittedly only tried out thanks to y’all. It’s a very gentle, watery liquid that doesn’t sting broken skin, so it’s become my go-to when my skin decides that it’s had enough of my shit. Currently I’m dealing with a bout of stress-triggered eczema around my eyelids and mouth, and I’ve been forgoing my usual SKII wombo combo and applying only the Cezanne all over my face. It’s not a super dry skin killer by any means, but if you’re looking for gentle moisture give it a try! (Would I repurchase? No, cause this chonker bottle is gonna outlive me.)    
    
**Skin Aqua Tone up UV Essence (Mint Green, SPF50+ PA++++)** – My cheeks are naturally quite red; a blessing and a curse. I can’t apply blush without looking like a clown unless I neutralize the redness first, which is where the Tone up Essence steps in. It has a slightly gel-y, slightly watery texture with a light green tint, and when applied all over the skin manages to somewhat cancel out my cheek redness. It sinks in in around 5 minutes and leaves a mildly shiny, slightly sticky finish. I wouldn’t recommend depending on only the Tone up Essence for dealing with redness but it’s a decent preliminary step. (Would I repurchase? No, but only because I have so many other sunscreens to finish up and this isn’t HG status.)    
    
**Innisfree aqua UV protection cream (SPF50+ PA++++)** – I went on a bit of an Innisfree sunscreen spree (dat rhyme dou) over the past couple months, starting with this one. It’s a slightly yellow-tinged, light gel-ish texture that I would describe as a thicker version of everyone’s beloved Biore UV Aqua Rich. Sinks in after 5 minutes, leaving a bit of a shiny finish. A very decent daily driver sunscreen that serves as a good base for makeup. (Would I repurchase? Possibly. I wouldn’t call this an HG, but its performance, especially considering the price, is more than adequate.)    
    
**Innisfree Tone Up No Sebum Sunscreen (SPF50+ PA++++)** – The definition of regret. When I tested this out in store, under the lighting it seemed to be a mildly pink tinged sunscreen that sunk in quickly and beautifully. The next morning I happily applied it all over my face… only to discover that the “mild” pink tinge turned me 50 shades of chalky pale. To be fair the texture is quite pleasant: a slightly thick but very spreadable creamy texture which is what enticed me in the first place. A perfect product for ghosts. (Would I repurchase? I regret the purchase.)    
    
**Innisfree daily UV protection essence sensitive (SPF50+ PA++++)** – Dry skinned folks, I’ve got a winner for you! This essence is thick and creamy but not greasy. As I’m currently not dry-skinned (Japan’s summer is fucking humid) this is a bit too thick for me at the moment. Takes around 10 minutes to sink in and leaves my skin shiny, necessitating powder. (Would I repurchase? No. I prefer the texture of Innisfree’s aqua UV protection cream.)    
    
    
**Lash and Liner Products**    
    
**K-palette 1 Day Tattoo Real Strong Eyeliner 24h WP (Burgundy)** – In the pictures this may look like an indistinct darkish color, and tbh that assumption isn’t too far from the truth. I’d describe this as more of a dark brown burgundy-tinted color than pure burgundy. The applicator dispenses a line of generous thickness, and the liner itself dries down to a demi-matte finish. Is it waterproof? Hell yes. Buyer beware, if you have textured eyelids I wouldn’t recommend this since it has a slight tendency to settle into fine lines. (Would I repurchase? No. It’s a decent eyeliner, but I wanted burgundy, goddamnit!)    
    
**Uzu Eye Opening Liner (White)** – This eyeliner range sprung up in every single beauty store what seems like overnight a little over a month ago. Colors range from black, to grey, to blue, to green, to orange, etc etc and I decided to pick up the white to use for a dramatic eye-opening effect. This is another ultimate regret purchase. As you can see from the swatch photo, it seeps into fine lines in quite a tragic fashion. No bueno. (Would I repurchase? NO.)    
    
**Heroine Make Curl keep mascara base (Curl keep/long/volume)** – Full disclosure: the Heroine Make long and curl series is my holy grail of mascara. I have long lashes, but I’m the only one who can tell when I’m barefaced since they’re so straight. The long and curl mascaras are the only ones I’ve found so far that keeps my lashes curled throughout the day and don’t leave panda eyes. Roses bloomed and cheesy violin music faintly played in the background when I discovered Heroine Make released a mascara base. The wand is identical to Heroine Make’s long and curl series, and the base itself is tinged a soft black. I’ve used this in combination with the Advanced Film Long and Curl, with a very dramatic, spidery result. My preferred use of this base is actually as a mascara itself, since its thinner formula and soft black color imparts a very natural-looking, long, curled lash. (Would I repurchase? Yes, forever.)    
    
**Heroine Make Long and curl mascara Advanced Film (Burgundy)** – Now THIS is burgundy. Not quite as good at keeping a curl as the black long and curl formula, but it matches my hair color which is all I really wanted. (Would I repurchase? Yes.)    
    
**Heroine Make Micro Mascara Advanced Film** – This is basically the long and curl formula with a tiny wand. Wonderful for use on the lower lashes, and very useable on the upper lashes for those who prefer length over volume. (Would I repurchase? Yes.)    
    
**DHC Eyelash Tonic** – I apply this every night after showering. After a month of use, my lashes were noticeably longer and lusher. As mentioned before, I already have long lashes so I’m not wholly sure if it actually caused lash growth or just improved the condition of my already existing lashes (or both!). Nevertheless, as this tonic is reasonably priced, I would recommend anyone interested to give it a chance. (Would I repurchase? Yes. DHC also has a few different eyelash tonics, and I’m interested in trying the others as well.)    
    
    
**Cheek and Contour Products**    
    
**Paul & Joe Stick Highlighter (001)** – Guys, this highlighter is literally shaped like a cat wearing a tiny top hat. Which is of course why I impulse purchased it online without considering anything else. Thankfully, I’m glad to report that the performance is as impressive as its design. It’s an emollient, silver sheen containing zero glitter (hallelujah) that blends beautifully into the skin and doesn’t emphasize any texture. If someone asked me to recommend a natural looking highlighter for pale skin, this is it. (Would I repurchase? Even if Paul & Joe were to remove the cat head, I would buy it again.)    

**Paul & Joe Gel Blush (05)** – Two words: raspberry flush. The texture of this blush is that of a water and gel hybrid with ultra-glide and blendability. A very light dab is enough for a natural application. Those who enjoy a more intense color can also layer this without worrying about cakey-ness. (Would I repurchase? Yes, but not this color. The tone of this red is identical to my natural redness.)    

**Koh Gen Do Maifenshi Cream Tint (403 Peach Blossom)** – I received this tiny sample as gift when I bought the Koh Gen Do Gloss Film Foundation. It’s a dusky pink, hard balm which stays where you put it. Don’t expect mega blendability, although you can diffuse it with some quick finger or brush work. Sets quickly. (Would I repurchase? I like using this for a very natural flush, but I would not purchase the full size.)    
    
**Too cool for school ARTCLASS by Rodin Lumineuse Varnish** – This is a balm highlight compact containing a light pink highlight, a clear highlight, and a light purple highlight. I would recommend applying this with your fingers and patting. The highlighters are thick, but emollient, and apply well over both foundation and powder. No glitter, I would classify this as a natural highlighter despite the pink/purple as the sheen is subtle and glossy enough to look like natural oils. (Would I repurchase? No, although this compact is A+, I prefer powder or stick highlighters.)    
    
**Innisfree Smart Drawing Contouring (02 Cinnamon)** – This Is It. My Holy Grail Contour. It’s a perfect neutral warm-leaning tone with a great brush applicator. Thin, blends beautifully, natural, I love it so much. I LOVE THIS. (Would I repurchase? Until the day I die.)    
    
    
**Foundations and Powders**    
    
**Koh Gen Do Maifenshi Face Powder** – A finely milled setting powder that slightly mattifies and blurs the skin. It leaves a very slight pale cast which is unnoticeable unless someone nitpicky is bumping noses with you. Applies well with both a damp beauty sponge, brush, and powder puff, although I find the finish after sponge application to look the most flawless. (Would I repurchase? No, but only because I discovered the Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Finish Powder this month. Would I recommend this powder? Yes, it’s still a wonderful powder.)    
    
**Lunasol Skin Modeling Water Cream Foundation (OC01)** – This is a light to medium coverage foundation which I would describe as a hybrid liquid/cream formula. It’s light and spreads extremely easily over the skin. I would not recommend this to anyone with flaky, very textured, or dry skin as this foundation will not hide any texture. This dries to a demi-matte yet luminous finish. Not a no-makeup-makeup foundation but veering towards a more natural finish than not. (Would I repurchase? I’ve only worn this in a proper full-face once, so the jury is still out. More testing needed.)    
    
**Paul & Joe Gel Foundation (001)** – Breath in, breath out… I had such high hopes for this. The texture is similar to the gel blush, with a slippery smooth feel that bounces back against your fingers when you press into it. You’d think such an emollient formula would translate into porcelain skin, but this accentuates dryness and texture like CRAZY. Maybe this would work well on oily folks, but it’s not for me. (Would I repurchase? Too busy sobbing over broken dreams to answer.)    
    
**Koh Gen Do Gloss Film Foundation (012)** – Holy grail? This is the most natural powder foundation I’ve ever tried. Silky smooth feel, beautiful matte finish on the skin. Hard to overdo and covers discoloration (freckles, redness). I bought a backup for this already. (Would I repurchase? Already have.)    
    
    
**Eyeshadow**    
    
**SUQQU Designing Color Eyes (012)** – This is a juicy, ripe watermelon (or strawberry) in glorious, shimmering eyeshadow form. The formula of these shadows is densely packed with no discernable fallout and more pigmentation than you would expect from the average AB offering. SUQQU is a master of combining shimmers with microfine glitters. These shadows won’t last on the lid as long as extremely pigmented shadows of the ABH ilk, but they fade gracefully. This palette contains a celestial mint-green shimmer shadow, a cool-toned light pink shimmer, a cool medium pink shimmer, and  a cool dark brown matte with tiny gold microglitter. (Would I repurchase? No, since I’ll never fully pan this palette. However, I am planning on purchasing more SUQQU shadows in the future.)    
    
**SUQQU Designing Color Eyes (014)** – This palette contains shadows in a gorgeous, utterly gorgeous rose garden color story. We have a light, champagne shimmer, a warm matte brown with microfine gold glitter, a burgundy wine shimmer, and a mossy forest green shimmer. The shadows perform as described in the previous review. (Would I repurchase? See previous review.)    
    
    
**Concealers**    
    
**Innisfree Mineral Cover Fit Concealer (1)** – If you’re looking for a very reasonably priced, medium-coverage concealer, give this a try. It blends well and doesn’t accentuate texture. Quite creamy, and thick enough to cover well without looking cakey. (Would I repurchase? Yes.)    
    
**Etude House Big Cover Concealer Skin Fit PRO (Peach)** – My biggest insecurity is genetic dark circles that never go away despite proper sleep. This is my go-to concealer for color correcting dem damn dark circles. The formula is thick and extremely pigmented but will readily reveal any dry patches. (Would I repurchase? No. It does its job, but I’m certain there are formulas more suited to me out in the yonder.)    
    
**Cezanne Color Control Concealer (Soft Green)** – I purchased this in an attempt to neutralize my cheek redness. This concealer has a thin, slightly creamy formula and sheers out quickly which is great if you have only a bit of redness or want light coverage, but not quite enough for me. (Would I repurchase? No. Give me the industrial duty concealer!)    
    
**Canmake Cover & Stretch Concealer UV Waterproof (C01)** – Attempt No. 2 at red neutralization. Similar to the Cezanne green concealer, this just doesn’t do enough for me. It’s also an even thinner formula. (Would I repurchase? Hell no.)    
    
    
**Lips**    
    
**Paul & Joe Limited Edition Lipstick (005 Play That Funky Music)** – I gotta admit I bought this for the cute cat head design and the limited edition holographic case. This lipstick is a clear base chock full of superfine microglitter and some bigger gold tone glitters. Despite the super glittery formula, its texture is smooth and glides well over the lips. It feels balmy on the lips but isn’t uncomfortable. (Would I repurchase? No. This is the quintessential example of something that sparks joy but it’s enough to own it once.)    

**Paul & Joe Pearl Lipstick** – Yes, I really like cats. Could you tell? Another “I bought it cause it’s glittery and has a cute AF cat head.) This is the silver version of the Play That Funky Music, with an identical formula. (Would I repurchase? Same as previous review.)    
    
**Decorte Tint Lipgloss (BE830)** – A super beautiful, medium coverage, coral-pink gloss with gold multiglitter. Spread easily, stays where it should, makes your lips look flawlessly shiny. You’ll feel a glossy texture on your lips but not in an unpleasant, sticky fashion. (Would I repurchase? Yes. This goes fabulously with the pink/orange shadows I enjoy wearing.)    
    
**Etude House Blur Tint (01 Soft Pepper)** – Works exactly as described. This is a warm, dusty red that can be applied heavily for an opaque, blurry-matte finish or sheered out for gradient lips. It’s light on the lips with impressive slip. However, this will transfer, so prepare for regular touch ups. (Would I repurchase? No. I wouldn’t consider this a necessary lip item for me since I gravitate towards more glossy finishes regularly  but am happy to have it in my collection. Would I recommend it? Yes.)    
    
**Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Vanilla)** – Roses are red, violets are blue, don’t need other balms, I only want you. This is the only product that will actively heal my occasional stress-eczema lips. Even when my lips are in decent condition, I’ll generously coat them before be and wake up to plump, hydrated goodness. (Will I repurchase? I have three backups.)

"Singaporeans and Malaysians, can you recommend stores with uncommon/rare J-Beauty products?","I know there are quite a few Singaporeans and Malaysians in this subreddit, so I'm hoping a few of you won't mind giving me suggestions. I'll be visiting next month to see family and to have a proper vacation. I love Japanese skincare/haircare and live in a very touristy Japanese area in the US, so I have physical access to a lot of common brands (Hada-Labo, Kikumasamune, Anessa, etc) and some uncommon ones (Kuramoto Bijin). However, I've been going deeper recently. I already know I'll be going to Takashimaya, but are there little stores with uncommon or rare Japanese skincare brands that I should be keeping an eye out for?

If it helps, I'll be in Singapore (Chinatown), KL, and Penang. I'm very familiar with Singapore's MRT and buses, less familiar with Malaysia but can figure things out and I have Grab, and will be traveling solo so other than some time blocked off for family I have time to go all out looking for stores. I would be especially happy if I can stock up on things from Matsumoto (Hadauru) or Country & Stream. Suggestions for any products for normal/dry skin or interesting Japanese brands would also be very cool too!

EDIT 8/17: Thank you so, so much to everyone! You all gave me excellent advice on stores, the best chains, and even with excellent directions and closest MRT stations. I'm going to load up on so many products that I'll have trouble putting it away when I get back home!",1565987253.0,0.95,74

"[Science] Preventative Aging! FDA Approved LED Therapy indicated for wrinkle reduction, acne, collagen production, etc","Hey chicas! Check out what I found!  [This is an aggregate of 4,000+ clinical studies supporting LED therapy effectiveness](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZKl5Me4XwPj4YgJCBes3VSCJjiVO4XI0tIR0rbMBj08/edit?fbclid=IwAR12jUUxfoS8NvruQDMgJmyfDXCvNPGD8BYmIFZKAQWoRYj5oCsAi8Zw5yg#gid=0) and all of it's various treatment options (anti-aging, collagen production, hair, wrinkle reduction, skin firmness, fat loss, hair growth production etc).  Some Finnish med student compiled this I think?


What the hell is this and why should I care you ask? TLDR: Without a doubt, LEDs work. Currently what is being studied is *how* they work. 
For the longest time people thought infared lasers where amazing  for antiaging etc. Then NASA 🚀 conducted an experiment in space on wound healing and found red LEDs made wounds heal like super duper fast, like shockingly impressively fast. Then everyone was like oooooohhhhhhhhh maybe it's not just the lasers that are awesome, maybe it's the infared too! And these studies support that yup, it's the infared too (although lasers are still great!). And there are studies showing the same results whether infared lasers or infared LEDs are used. You should care because LEDs are a more cost effective treatment option for preventative aging techniques and celebrities use this technology but keep it on the DL. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t plan on aging, I'd rather wear sunscreen religiously and chill by some LEDs than get microneedling, botox, chemical peels etc. That is expensive and painful and if there's something that will work synergistically with those treatments or allow me to delay using them, I want in. 💁🏻‍♀️Everyone should be able to access information that allows them to look their best, and beauty shouldn’t be reserved for the wealthy. 😘 As long as I’m talking about economic discrepancies, shout-out to [Dr. Dray](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCnxmUrGMtpQT844Yd_l7Zyg?itct=CCYQ6p4EIhMIhOeC6cKM5AIVSLucCh04ZgfH&csn=G1JZXf32LMjp8wS384aIBw&wlfg=true) for helping those without access to healthcare still get quality opinions on how they can help treat themselves so people can make informed decisions without wasting their money on pseudoscience and marketing. LEDs can also be used to assist pain management and is something that can be shared with older family members, this has multi-generational benefits 💸

Let's discuss! First and foremost, I saw another user on here had posted LED blue light therapy did nothing for her acne, and I believe her since hormonal acne will not be cleared by antimicrobial blue light and she most likely had hormonal acne. That being said, I talked to my mom (Japanese) and she said there's quite a bit of literature on LED therapy, therapeutic uses and side effects. It seems like in the USA there's still fledgling adoption (and a TON of people who are like, there's no negative side effects and it will cure cancer and do your laundry too!) which I give major side eye to 🤨. However, there is significant scientific data supporting LED therapy will increase collagen, have antiaging effects and do all sorts of peripheral non-beauty related things. I'd like to find out:


1.) If you're in Asia, or a country that has adopted LED therapy more than the US has (I suspect we are tragically behind the same way our sunscreen sucks), what kind of clinical data do you have on it? Are there recommended dosing guidelines? Ex: A 640nm wavelength red LED light, stand in front for 30min a day 3x/week, again see 3371 below

2.) For anyone that has used this therapy, what were your results? I'm hearing a lot of good anecdotal stories, and would like more. Please be detailed, and if it didn't work, did you give it the recommended amount of time and what wavelength was used? I hear LEDs need to be used consistently 

3.) Does anyone know anything about Celluma? There's a ton of LEDs on the US market (Joovv, Red Rush, Celluma, Biomax etc) but it seems only the Celluma is FDA indicated for reducing wrinkles/fine lines/acne etc and has a wound healing indication in the EU. I also spoke with a Celluma rep who told me the company is currently undergoing peripheral neuropathy trials, so this product seems legit however I am skeptical as hell and other than this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcQ58dNe_pc) can't seem to find any reviews of it that aren't just text based quotes from aestheticians. I also am skeptical of it's lack of negative reviews. I’d like to talk to someone that owns one.

4.) I'm hoping others will find this as interesting and compelling as I do so we can crowdsource our knowledge especially with our overseas sisters, because while the [medical device approval process by the FDA](https://www.healthnewsreview.org/toolkit/tips-for-understanding-studies/medical-devices/) seems pretty shoddy compared to that of pharmaceuticals (whaaaat?! No clinical trials necessary?!?) the ancedotal and clinical data can't be denied. 

IT'S 👏NEVER 👏TOO 👏LATE 👏FOR 👏PREVENTATIVE 👏AGING, WHOSE WITH ME? 🙌

EDIT: Similar to the [infamous eyelash curler thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/2r4rfs/eyelash_curlers_in_numbers_measuring_their/), where we crowdsourced data on optical curvatures, my intention here is to crowdsource data on what wavelength/color/pulse activity LEDs are in higher end face masks (ex: Dr.Gross SpectraLite, Celluma etc) because there are lots of LED face masks at unaffordable prices and my aim is to crowdsource so we can all benefit. Most companies list online, or you can talk to a customer service rep, and they will tell you what the wavelengths are. As Class II Medical devices, this data is available!  [Example see pg.8](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf17/K171323.pdf). However, please keep in mind it is not as simple as just wavelength, other aspects to measure are intensity, treatment dose, time used, distance held etc. **This is already somewhat organized in the clinical trial spreadsheet, but I highly recommend you [WATCH THIS](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0MMewRIP51M) as a primer, or at the very least watch the first and last 10 minutes.** Remember not to treat this as a definitive guide and to view everything with a skeptical lense as this is an American perspective. My mom translated some Japanese info for me and obviously this doesn’t have zero side effects as many claim which is why we should work together and keep safety in mind. I like the format of the original spreadsheet and would like to keep track of LED face masks and body panels in a similar fashion😊 We need to spend more time poking around not only the specs of devices on the market, but also the “parameters” section of the spreadsheet so we can compare the ranges of what we can buy to what yields the optimal results for anti-aging**

I’m going to post the cell number of articles in the spreadsheet I think are worth skimming.

Purito Comfy Water Sun Block SPF 50 PA ++++ (Brown Skin Friendly!),"I received this sunblock today from YesStyle. During their summer sale it was ~$20 Canadian for 60 ml. I have been using Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence and loving it but found it a little too moisturizing for the hot summer weather. I also wanted to have a physical sunscreen as an option for when I travel because I usually choose a beach destination. 

I have been pleasantly surprised!

I am a MAC NC45 so physical sunscreens don’t often work for me. The only one that has applied without a whitecast is Josie Maran’s Argan Daily Moisturizer SPF 47 and it’s way too oily for my combo skin as well as being $45 Canadian for 60ml. 

So imagine my shock when I spread this very white cream into my hand and the whitecast completely disappeared! I applied it the way Renee Gothamista recommends - in two thin layers - and have been wearing it on my face a full day. It has a satin finish and I find it controls my oil completely without leaving me dry.

I have not tried it under makeup yet but because of the oil control it seems very promising. It is layered over my morning routine of toner, vitamin c serum and moisturizer.

It’s definitely a 5/5 for cosmetic elegance, price and protection of coral reefs. Sadly, it’s out of stock at YesStyle right now but I will definitely order it again.

First-Time AB Buyer Review of YesStyle haul,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hqtxyvffj9g31.jpg

Hi, everyone!  As the title says, I recently (like over a month ago lol) made my first ever AB purchase through YesStyle.  I've lurked on this subreddit for a few months before finally taking the plunge and ordering a few beauty products from YesStyle to test them against their non AB counterparts.  I purchased 2 mascaras, 2 sunscreens, 1 lip tint, and 3 eyebrow pencils.  I purchased these specific items with the intention of finding an AB product that I'd want to incorporate into my daily routine, and sun protection and eye products rank pretty highly in my list of everyday essentials.

**Criteria:** Being the person that I am, I wanted to give each product a fair shot before writing this review, hence why it's taken me over a month to get this out here.  I also want to set some criteria for what I'm personally looking for in a product, and what I would consider a good product worth repurchasing.  Each product reviewed will be assessed according to price, ease of use or application, overall appearance, longevity, and ""miscellaneous after effects"" (aka what happens after I take the product off).  I bought my products during a mega sale, but I'm going to include the non-sale price of each product in order to reflect its usual value.

**AND FINALLY, THE PRODUCTS:**

*Innisfree Skinny Microcara Zero (US $18.90):* This mascara was recommended on this subreddit, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  My first impression of the product was ""wow, that's a small wand"", and it is!  It reminds me of a tiny screw you'd lose in the carpet while trying to assemble an Ikea desk.  Tiny wand aside, it actually holds more product than you'd expect, and I didn't need to keep dipping it back into the mascara well.  The formula is pretty lengthening, although it's rather wet and I found it a little *too* easy to get spider lashes while applying it.  It took a little work, but I was able to separate the lashes and get them looking the way I'd like them to.  The mascara wore pretty well throughout the day, but about 10 hours in I noticed it starting to run, and my eyes stung like some of it had gotten in them (yikes!).  I tend to have pretty long days, so it's important that my makeup doesn't do me in like that...  For the price, I'd say that I could find a comparable product at a U.S. drug store, probably even for cheaper.  I don't see myself buying this mascara again.  **2/5**

*Tony Moly Pang Pang Double Needs Mascara-Shade Black (US $7.90):* Another recommendation from this subreddit.  The wand is much more typical of what you'd find in a Western mascara, with a drier formula than the Innisfree one.  I can get some decent length with a single coat of this product, but I honestly prefer it with two coats.  Unlike the Innisfree mascara, I didn't notice any running/smudging after a long day of wearing, although I did see one or two flakes on my cheeks.  I definitely preferred this mascara of the two I tried, though I will warn you that it takes more effort than usual to remove it with a makeup wipe.  That said, I enjoyed this mascara more than any Western mascara I've tried in the past few years, so it's officially joined the daily routine squad. **4.5/5**

*Etude House Sunprise Must Daily Lotion SPF50+ PA+++ (US $18.90):* I've been a daily sunscreen wearer for over a year now, and I've been interested in trying out AB suncreens in the hope that they don't clog my pores as bad as some non AB lotions do.  This formula is fairly thick and reminiscent of suncreens I can buy in the U.S., but doesn't leave nearly as intense a white cast as I'm used to, which is a definite plus.  I'm naturally pretty pale already, but an obvious white cast makes me look seriously ill.  The scent is a bit curious on this sunscreen; it's much more pleasant than your typical sunscreen smell, but that makes me think it's got an added fragrance?  Either way, while this lotion didn't break me out, per se, I did notice that any pimple that I applied this on top of seemed to double in size, which makes me think that this sunscreen is not compatible with my skin.  **3/5**

*Missha All-Around Safe Block Essence Sun Milk SPF50+ PA+++ (US $17.90):* The formula of this sun...milk?...is much runnier than the Etude House lotion, and I find it has that more characteristic sunscreen smell, which is encouraging to me that it isn't using fragrance.  Because of the runny consistency, it applied basically clear to my skin and didn't give off a white cast.  The first day I used this, I noticed a higher-than-usual number of blackheads on my face, but they cleared up in about a day, so it's hard to say if the sunscreen was the issue.  The finish was dewy, but it didn't degrade into an oily, messy sheen later in the day, which I appreciate.  While I enjoyed using this product, I'm not sure if it really outperforms my non AB sunscreens.  **4/5**

*Etude House Dear Darling Water Gel Tint-Color PK004 Red Bean Red (US $11.90):*  I don't typically wear a lot of colorful makeup, but sometimes I crave just a hint of color on my lips, so I wanted to test out a sheer formula to see how it looked on me.  With one layer, this lip tint gives me a nice, subtle, your-lips-but-better tint that you can build up for a little more *oompf*.  I'm a big fan of the scent, which reminds me of those fruit punch Koolaid packets (my boyfriend says they remind him of SweetTarts).  The first time I wore this tint, I had it on top of a lip balm, which made the color fade away pretty quickly, but the color lasts a few hours on bare lips alone.  Overall, it's about what I expected from a lip tint, and I like the color enough that I think I'll continue using it.  **4/5**

*Etude House Drawing Slim Eye Brows 1.5mm-Shade 6 Soft Black (US $5.90):*  As you can probably tell by the number of pencils I bought, filling in my eyebrows is a daily must for me.  I'm a natural blonde, but my hair is dyed black, so I tend to look like a surprised alien without product in my brows.  I pair my brow pencils with a brow mascara, so what I look for in a pencil is something dark (but not *too* dark) to complement and fill out the preexisting hairs.  I like the overall size of this pencil; it's very slim and I have a lot of control over the strokes.  With this product, I really feel like I can make my brows look fairly natural without having to work too hard at it.  My only concern is that it fades throughout the day, and I'm not confident that it will be able to hold up in sweaty conditions.  However, for the time being, this product is going in my daily use pile.  **4/5**

*Tony Moly Lovely Eyebrow Pencil-Shade 01 Black ( US $7.90):*  The size of this pencil is much larger than the Etude House one, and the product itself was soft and applied much darker than I was anticipating.  Before diffusing it with a spoolie, I felt like I had just applied permanent marker to my face, and I was honestly a little horrified.  With more than a little work, I was able to get the product to look okay, but I'm not really satisfied with my brows looking just *okay*.  Plus, after a few hours, the product essentially separated from my brows and was easily removed if I so much as bumped my eyebrow.  I really was not a fan of this product, and I will not be using it in the future.  **1/5**

*Innisfree Auto Eyebrow Pencil-Shade Dark Black (US $4.90):*  This pencil had many of the same downfalls as the Tony Moly pencil did:  it was large and awkward to apply, the pencil was soft and applied too dark, and ultimately did not last throughout the day.  Because it mirrored so many of the things I disliked about the other pencil, I will not be using it in the future. **1/5**

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:** Out of these products, I found two products that I really like (the Tony Moly mascara and the Etude House brow pencil), along with a few products I might add into my routine from time to time.  However, two of the brow pencils I tried were complete duds, which was a bit disappointing.  I would definitely like to try more AB products in the future, and if anyone has any recommendations for brow pencils or brow mascaras to try, I'd love to hear about them!",1565728066.0,0.94,18

Water quality in Japan v. US - skincare/haircare,"I just got back from Japan and I’m noticing a crazy difference in my skin and hair quality. When I was in Japan, my skincare products sunk in really well and my hair was honestly so incredible (no frizz, curls formed perfectly, shiny, not much build up). I got back to the US and my skincare products don’t feel as luxurious when I put them on and my hair/curls feels more limp. I’d love to hear from others if they’ve had this experience or if they can shed light on this.

Issues with Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk (repackaged version)?,"Hello!

If anyone has used the repackaged version, can you share your experience with it? Is it giving you any issues? How does it compare to the gold version?

This sunscreen is my holy grail and I haven’t found anything else that’s worked on my sensitive, acne-prone skin with FA. I’ve gone through about 4 of the gold bottles.

**Results:**  
My skin has been a little bit cranky since I tried the Klairs Soft Airy UV sunscreen, with some persistent redness on my nose, despite having stopped all my actives for about a week now. I was hesitant to try anything new, but I threw caution to the wind and applied a generous layer of this last night, directly after washing in tepid water. It made a noticeable difference in the redness. I should have taken pics or done just half a face, but the difference was legit. Obviously, I decided I needed a second layer, and woke up to skin that looks a lot better. Not perfect, mind you, but a noticeable difference.

VT Cosmetics Phyto Line review,"hi all! purchased the entire set in may and have been using it everyday since. i can fully say that i am in love with this line and i have not seen any reviews of it since it was launched. i bought it purely because it was on sale and i wanted to test out the brand (and also got a BTS poster as a gift for spending above the limit!). the only things excluded from the set are the phyto cream (380ml tub), phyto mist, and phyto blackhead pick-up stick. i have dehydrated oily and sensitive skin, with occasional hormonal breakouts during that time of the month. apologies for any grammar errors as english is not my first language!

VT Phyto Cleanser: 7/10. cleanses skin very well, great second cleanser as it does not leave any residue. you do not need to wipe face with toner and cotton pad to ensure that face is clean. may leave skin feeling a bit tight but it has not broken me out.

VT Phyto Skin: 10/10. this is not the kind of toner to put on a cotton pad as it soaks up really quickly. i use this in the morning with the 7 skin method and at night before cream. leaves skin feeling nourished upon application.

VT Phyto Emulsion: 10/10. i use this after the toner in the morning and it is a perfect base before foundation. leaves skin looking soft and flawless after makeup. highly recommend!

VT Phyto Eye Cream: 5/10. quite disappointed with this eyecream. i would skip this but it was included in the set, so why not try it out? i use this only at night as it is very thick and honestly i find that it has the same texture as the phyto premium cream. i would not repurchase this.

VT Phyto Cream Premium (50ml): 8/10. very thick balmy texture. needs to be heated between fingers before applying on skin. i only use this at night after cleansing and applying toner. this is a great final step facial cream as it locks in and supplies moisture well throughout the night. my face feels really soft in the morning. holy grail status!

VT Phyto Mask: 10/10. this mask is very moisturising and the fit of the mask suits my face well, especially the eye area. i would say that the texture of the mask is more gel-like than paper, and there is plenty of serum left in the packet. i would buy 100 of these if i could!

Overall: 9/10. some things in this line can be replaced but i am happy with my purchase as it has not broken me out! in fact, since using this line my skin has improved. my pores no longer get clogged and my breakouts have calmed down tremendously. it is not marketed as such but i have definitely noticed a huge difference in my complexion! will try the cica line after i run out and do a comparison.",1565524183.0,0.89,1

Best routine for dry skin on legs?,"Been lurking on here and have learned so much about skincare and have been able to restore my moisture barrier on my face.

[SUNSCREEN REVIEW + oily skin + humid climate] My most perfect sunscreen thus far - A'pieu Soo Boo Ji Sun Cotton Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++,"# A'pieu Soo Boo Ji Sun Cotton Sunscreen (SPF50+ PA++++)

Hello fellow AB-ers!!!

**Confession: I NEVER EVER wore sunscreen daily prior to finding this sunscreen.** Hence, I'm really SOOooOOOooo excited to share my sunscreen Holy Grail with you guys because it seems like I've finally found a sunscreen that WORKS for me + is **alcohol-free** \+ has an **excellent ingredients list.** Sadly, it's SOOOO underrated.. very little people on Reddit are talking about it, so I just had to sit down and type this review.

**Update (12 Aug 2019):** So far I counted **10 other AB-redditers** that agree this sunscreen is awesome (especially for oily skin) based on the comments section. It's not a huge amount per se, but still a substantial number, and I'm so glad we all stumbled on this gem of a sunscreen together! :) However, I also gathered that this sunscreen broke 2 people out, contains some ingredients that may not sit well with certain skin types etc... Ultimately, I think finding the best sunscreen is really a long and tough journey - sunscreen is a product that contains many crazy ingredients to block out UV rays (damn you UV rays!!!). For myself, the journey has (hopefully) come to an end, but what works for me and others may not work for you - everyone is created differently. So keep experimenting, sharing, and recommending good+clean sunscreens to others around you (and don't forget to post your review on Reddit)! :)

\-----------------------------------------

***Abit of information about my skin type, my job:***

* I live in **hot, humid Singapore** (tropical climate, daily temperatures reach 34-35 degrees Celsius, humidity levels about 80-90%+)
* Age 23
* My typical day is working in a hospital (and it's usually in the **non-air-conditioned hospital wards,** so I really do get very hot, sticky, sweaty, and oily!!!)
* **Oily skin** \+ **sweat** ALOT on my face area + prone to **blocked pores when using nasty products -** closed comedones/whiteheads which somehow are not there in the morning, but magically make a guest appearance at the end of the day when I look into the mirror!
* **Yep, I** ***NEVER EVER*** **wore sunscreen on a daily basis in the past.** SHOCKING RIGHT?! I knew the importance of it, how it protects from ageing etc, but i ALWAYS found myself having closed, blocked pores after adding sunscreen to my routine. Hence i always skipped sunscreen, and relied on my Laneige Pore Control BB cushion for it's sunscreen properties... ignoring the advice that the level of sun protection in BB cushions are never sufficient!
* After stumbling across this particular A'pieu sunscreen, I've finally found a sunscreen which I can commit to wearing on a daily basis (I have been wearing it for the past week every single day!! WOOOHOOO!).

\-----------------------------------------

***Pros:***

* CHEAP $
* Alcohol-free!
* Super clean ingredients - without any exceptionally comedogenic or harmful ingredients... which is AMAZING and hard to find in a sunscreen because they seem to be jam-packed with so many crazy ingredients!!! (The most concerning ingredients of this product are covered below in the “Cons” section)
* No plant essential oils that I can find in the ingredients list (correct me if I am wrong). The ""Opuntia Coccinellifera Fruit Extract"" 2nd on the ingredients list comes from the cactus called Prickly Pear, not an essential oil.
* Texture: Watery lotion, sinks into skin really well, does not leave a residue
* **Does not leave me feeling sticky or oily AT ALL!**
   * I stress this point because alot of people have said that the Biore and Klairs sunscreens (which I discuss below) do not leave a sticky and oily residue on their skin... but on my skin, **THEY DO! :(**
* NO WHITE CAST
* I wore this for a short hike in Bukit Timah Hill (Singapore is really hot and humid so I sweated a ton), and it **didn't sting my eyes** like other sunscreens do.. usually my eyes sting when sweat droplets from my forehead mix with the sunscreen I'm wearing and trickle down into my eyes.
* Does NOT give me any breakouts or comedones!!!!! A+++++
* I set my face with Innisfree No Sebum powder pact after finishing, and there is no caking either.

***Cons:***

* Unlikely to be waterproof (I'm not 100% sure about this but it doesn't say anywhere that it IS waterproof, so I would not wear it to swim/to the beach)
* Has a fragrance last on the ingredients list (smells like a typical Banana Boat sunscreen, but I am not sensitive to smell, and it disappears a while after you apply it... It's just like wearing perfume where you cannot smell yourself after awhile.)
* (A CON AND A PRO?) Contains polymers derived from dimethicone. However, even though I am REALLY very prone to blocked pores (those nasty white bumps filled with pus that appear at the end of a hot sweaty humid day after you wear a terrible product), I have not experienced any such issues with this sunscreen, which is nothing short of a miracle for me. Instead, like i mentioned above, I believe the small amount of dimethicone-derived polymers function as a primer (most primers contain some), and I do notice this sunscreen makes my BB cream less patchy in the driest corners of my mouth and nose!

\-----------------------------------------

***Why I prefer it over the other sunscreens I've tried:***

* Other sunscreens which I have tried in the past that did not work for me include:
   * Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery essence (the 2017 reformulated version, not the 2019 reformulated version)
   * Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery gel (the 2017 reformulated version, not the 2019 reformulated version)
   * Dear Klairs Soft Airy UV essence
* The Biore and Klairs sunscreen also all have numerous icky ingredients in their formulations (click the links below and you'll see alot of ""**red**"").
   * [https://www.skincarisma.com/products/biore/uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-spf50-pa-2017-version](https://www.skincarisma.com/products/biore/uv-aqua-rich-watery-essence-spf50-pa-2017-version)
   * [https://bit.ly/2TkQKb0](https://bit.ly/2TkQKb0)
   * [https://www.skincarisma.com/products/klairs/soft-airy-uv-essence/ingredient\_list#info-section](https://www.skincarisma.com/products/klairs/soft-airy-uv-essence/ingredient_list#info-section)
* The Biore sunscreens listed above ALL contain alcohol high-up in their ingredients list, and resulted in me getting dehydrated flaky skin. Somehow the other ingredients also made me develop closed comedones around my chin area.
* The Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence sunscreen was overall terrible for me. I had high hopes for this one, as a lot of AB-ers talk about it in this forum. But it had a very very sticky feeling, made me really oily-shiny after application, and also caused multiple closed comedones for me at the end of the day.

***If any of you ladies are like me, who experience many woes trying to find a good sunscreen (especially those with oily skin + living in a tropical climate like Singapore), I highly recommend you try out the A'pieu ""Soo Boo Ji"" Sun Cotton :)***

***I even bought one tube for my sister-in-law who actually inspired me to begin this renewed search for sunscreen. She was previously using the Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence for many years, but was getting increasingly concerned about the high level of alcohol in it! :(***

***Additionally, If you know of any other sunscreens that are ALCOHOL-FREE with CLEAN ingredients (run the ingredients through skincarisma.com), do list them in the comments to share with our AB-er community! :) Cheers!***",1565449987.0,0.97,162

[Discussion] Is YesStyle selling old sunscreens?,"I was recently interested in buying these two Japanese sunscreens from YesStyle: [Suncut UV Protect Essence](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/kose-suncut-uv-protect-essence-spf-50-pa-80g/info.html/pid.1049554478) and [Skin Aqua Super Moisture Essence](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/rohto-mentholatum-skin-aqua-super-moisture-essence-sunblock-spf-50/info.html/pid.1060919652). 

However, I noticed that Ratzilla's blog, which keeps a comprehensive list of sunscreens on the Japanese market, shows the Suncut sunscreen was [repackaged mostly recently in 2016](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/suncut-uv-protect-essence/) and has since been discontinued, and the Skin Aqua was [repackaged in 2018](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/mentholatum-skin-aqua-uv-super-moisture-essence/). I haven't seen anything else on the internet  that indicates these sunscreens are still being produced. 

I do \*not\* want to start any unsubstantiated rumors as I don't speak Japanese and don't really have the ability to research this, and Ratzilla's site doesn't necessarily have an encyclopedic inventory of Japanese sunscreens! But this just made me concerned: is it possible YesStyle is selling sunscreens that were packaged a few years ago and have lost their efficacy? Can anyone here who lives in Japan confirm whether these sunscreens are still being sold in stores there? 

I'm also contacting YesStyle and let you all know what I find out.",1565442937.0,0.77,14
Belif Moisturizer Bomb Update,"Hi there! I promised I would do an update on this product. I love the scent, but felt after a few days that I felt it was a bit too heavy for my face. I started using it on my arms and elbows, and that seemed to work nicely. I did try to ""cut"" the moisturizing cream because it was a bit thick. I haven't quite gotten anything idea to use for that. Perhaps it will change for winter, since my skin actually gets drier in the winter time. We shall see. Thanks everyone for all your input! I still plan on ordering some more Belif products in the future and will post on another forum.

How does climate/weather inform your Asian beauty routine and practices?,"Hi AB friends,  
**How does your skin respond to weather changes where you live?**  
Do you find humidity (or aridity) affecting how successful a product is for your skin?

I'm still new to the game and would love to hear your personal experiences!

As for me --  
Humidity in my hometown remains relatively consistent throughout the year --  ±70 to 80% humidity.  
When I first started out, I was going off of Western recommendations (Trader Joe's HA serum, Eucerin) for my dry skin, but I took a chance and tried Asian products in hopes for better hydration and feel.I experimented with Belif Moisturizing Bomb & Kohakuhada first but ditched both for Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Toner and Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask EX.   
My skin *loves* the HA toner, but I have a hunch I should use a lighter moisturizer for the summer.

My double eyelid surgery experience as a hapa: initial results and mixed feelings,"https://ibb.co/9WMxfVd 

I HONESTLY feel like double eyelid is meant for full asian people... At least as of now... I HOPE my opinion changes when or if my eyelids fully recover and show final result 

Hi everyone I got incisional double eyelid surgery in seoul over two weeks ago. I'm 75% east asian and 25% English.  I kind of already had a double eyelid to begin with? But the crease was quite small and many times my brow fat and upper eye lid dropped down which made my eyes look smaller and resemble more that of monolids. Anyways in my photo I did put several pre-op images because my eyelids seemed to fluctuate and on good days I had small double eyelids while on bad days I had lots of upper eyelid droop. 

I don't even look asian anymore. Everyone says I look more white then asian now and its causing me so much dysphoria. What the hell did I do to my face

It looks extremely unnatural and uncanny at the moment but the photos are cropped to only my eyes so it might not be as easy to tell from the images. 

Anyways my real question is. What can I expect in the future? 

I absolutely hate my eyes right now. It's already been two weeks and I still don't like them. I am hoping they get better. 

I am praying to God that they're still super extremely fucking swollen because I absolutely hate them.  I thought they'd just remove the upper eyelid droop and make my creased a tad bigger. I hope once they deswell and recover my eyes look better and more asian and less fake. My eyes look like European eyes right now and are very big for an asian and it does not fit my face. 

Even my family didn't sugar coat it they said I looked fake and like an anime character and don't even look asian anymore. My mom almost cried and said she lost her baby boy and it made me feel like shit. I won't sugar coat it either I honestly regret this surgery I thought it would be minor boost for my upper eyelid droop and I wouldnt look fake. My eyes and eyelids look so big and I don't even real anymore. Nearly all Asians especially in Korea get this I thought it would be a safe bet but considering the fact I'm a small portion white and kind of in a sense already had double eyelids should had been a factor to not do it. 

Someone please tell me the final result will look much better and I'm still extremely swollen and have PLENTY of recovery to go? But over two weeks already passed and I'm starting to lose hope. 

Not so happy with the initial results so what should I expect as final result? Especially as a hapa? 


While I do fully regret this right now at the current moment I hope I don't in the future and that it is much better and more asian looking.",1565342267.0,0.75,48
[Discussion] Does anybody else use body oil?,"I started using body oil regularly earlier this year. I originally was using it before zinc sunscreen because zinc dries my skin out so badly.

Before, my skin would get so dry in the winter that my itchy, dry back would keep me awake at night. That doesn’t happen anymore!

I’m not using it as often right now because my skin isn’t so dry during the summer.  But I was curious - does anyone else use body oil? Has it helped your skin? Any AB ones you can suggest? The one I’m using now isn’t AB, but I’d like to find one that is.",1565330167.0,1.0,11

I LOVE the Goodal Water Melon Soothing Gel,"(They spell watermelon as two separate words, not me)

I took a break from posting on here a few years ago so I could use up my collection and not want to buy more. It worked. I officially ran out of stuff and needed to place an order. 

I ran across the Goodall water melon soothing gel on the RoseRoseShop ebay store and picked it up as a middle step in my routine after my liquids and before my creams. It was very affordable, smells great (though nothing like watermelon), and unlike a lot of the soothing gels I've tried, it doesn't make me sticky AT ALL. It has a wonderful cooling effect, it seems to melt right into the skin and glides really easily. I have been doing a bit of facial massage with it just so I can use extra. 

Again, I haven't been on here in two years or so, bu I did a search first to see if anyone had mentioned this product. I didn't see anything though. I want to order another 10 jars.",1565250760.0,0.82,2

Just received my Stylevana order!,"After visiting South Korea and returning to Cali, I went around the internet to find some online stores that sold face products near/around as cheap as they were when I was in Myeongdong. Yesstyle has a nice selection but their prices are still quite pricey and don't really offer anything special other than access to a majority of Asian brands. I found Stylevana and was pretty surprised to see how low some of the on-sale products were. Some were VERY low and priced almost exactly as what I saw in the Myeongdong shopping district.

Generally over there in SK, most products are sold in bulk or have a BOGO deal so for example, if you see something online or instore in the US for $15, they might sell the same product but 3 for $15 in SK. Almost no other website sells products this low so I was pretty skeptical of the whole website and expected some scam where I'd buy a $10 faceproduct and then pay a large ""shipping fee"". I eventually gave it a try after running a few background checks on the site.

The website seems to always have a ""Buy more than $35"" for free shipping and either a 10% or 15% off coupon for new customers. Unless if you're in a rush, I would ignore the 10/15% discount and wait until they have a large sale. They tend to have better discounts such as ""Buy this amount and get % off"" or some variation of BOGO. When I made my purchase, they had a ""24% off on orders $50+"" deal for a summer sale. I noticed that you can't stack the cheaper 10/15% coupons on it but that's fine.

I placed my order on 07/20/19 while the actual dispatch date was 7/26. Just got the package today 8/7. The original shipping estimate was 8/6. A common complaint is that once the package arrives in the US, the shipping estimate is no longer shown and it'll say something about it being in a generic distribution center with no given location.

All of the products were wrapped in a lot of bubble wrap paper so they all arrived safely. Other than a small dent on the corner of the TonyMoly cream box, I'm happy with the decently-fast shipping (About 1.5 weeks, and this is free shipping from Hong Kong to California btw). I also paid for the $2 shipping insurance which covers any product that goes missing or damaged; this seems worth it if since I have a pretty big order.

Items I ordered:

**Tonymoly -** *The Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream (60ml)* : $9.99 (subtotal) -> **$7.59 (after 24% discount)**

**Etude House -** *0.2 Therapy Air Mask Aloe (35 masks)*: $13.65 -> **$10.37**

**Tonymoly -** *Pureness 100 Mask Sheet Green Tea (15 masks*): $6.75 -> **$5.13**

**Holika Holika -** *Aloe 99% Soothing Gel (55ml)* : $2.84 ->**$2.16**

**SENKA -** *Perfect Whip Cleansing Foam* : $3.29 -> **$2.50**

**Tonymoly -** *Panda's Dream White Sleeping Pack* : $5.49 -> **$4.17**

All of the products came in their original packaging and seem authentic. I bought the ChokChok watery cream before in Korea and the one I just got appears to be identical. Most of the products have their expiration date set in 2022-2023 so I'm pretty thankful none of them were expired. As a free sample, they threw in tiny one-time use packet of an oil cleanser from Missha.

As an added plus, their customer support is pretty active. One of the products I was purchasing went out of stock and they had no trouble sending me an email, saying that they would refund the remaining amount through PayPal. I ended up requesting them to just edit my order and add another face cleanser in as a replacement; they followed up on that within a few days. I'm also expecting another package in a week-ish for 15 more facemasks because they were out of stock so they divided my package into two-separate deliveries.

Overall, I'm very satisfied with Stylevana. Most of the products go on sale for very low prices so I would recommend checking the website every week to see if there's any good bargain. Almost all of the products I bought were on sale so the prices may have gone back up.

"I tried to love my dark skin when I was young even though my classmates and ny family made fun of me for it, so I whitened it.","I know skin-whitening is a sensitive topic to talk about on the media, but it is so common in Asia for a reason: people (mostly) have never loved dark skin tone. 

I was born with semi-tanned yellow skin tone( I wad born in Vietnam where it's always sunny) and I grew up getting darker and darker. I started getting comments about my skin in secondary school where my classmates (who I continued to have class with for another 4 years) and my family   wouldn't stop saying I looked dirty. My classmates would draw picture of me looking like a (black) pig and said I was ugly since they're mainly fairer than I. They still hung out with me, they just couldn't stop making fun of my dull, dark skin. 

It is even weirder that my family wanted to make fun of my skin. They asked if I was sure I was my mom's daughter since she had a very light skin tone. 

Later in my secondary school year (grade 8 &9 ), my mom allowed me and my sister (she also had tanned skin, just not as dark as mine) to use a whitening cream which she bought from a local market with no labels on it whatsoever. Back then, it was a time when skin-whitening market blew up. I used it for about ~5 months and my face was surprisingly much (like MUCH) lighter than the rest of my body since I didn't bother using it on my neck. It was amazing how my family and friends would start to compliment my skin and seemed somewhat closer to me. 

(skip forward: the cream has mercury in it and I stopped using it but then I had a lot of under-the-skin pimples, skin tone stayed relatively bright and pale) 

I moved to America 3 years ago (after finishing secondary school / 9th grade) with my sister and since then I spent a lot of money of Korean cosmetic with whitening purpose to even out my skin tone and cure my pimples. I went to a private high school with mostly Asian there and sometimes my friend group would make bad comments on someone with dark skin tone. I felt bad, but at the same time, I was glad to not have a dark skin tone anymore (I disgusted at myself for saying that) 

The main point of this story isn't to bash dark skin tone, but in general just me wishing Asian people would love any skin tone equally. I had to whiten it due to criticism and it sucked. It's hard to love your skin tone when people around you don't let you do it.

Negative effects from Biore UV Face Milk formula change?,"Hi all! I have oily/combo skin and am very acne-prone. I finally found my HG sunscreen last year in the Biore UV Face Milk (white bottle). Of course, this year it was reformulated! I did some research here and found a few people talking about the changes to the formula, but ultimately decided to repurchase since it seemed like it still dried down matte and controlled oil.

I opened and started using the new bottle on 8/4, and since then, I have noticed more breakouts, extremely dry and raw undereyes, and oilier than normal skin (my makeup separates and cakes, too). I'm not entirely sure if it's all related or if it's hormonal, but I have had my acne and oil under control for awhile so I'm discouraged at this setback. 

Has anyone else noticed any negative effects from the formula change? Most things I've seen have been people saying it's not a big deal, the product still works the same, etc. I'm not sure if I should stop using it or wait it out and see if things continue.",1565208590.0,0.92,19
Review: Rohto Mentholatum Sunplay Baby Milk Sunblock SPF 34 PA+++,"I haven't seen this Japanese SPF mentioned here, so I wanted to give you guys a little review. Not affiliated, etc. etc.

I've been using this sunscreen pretty much daily since April 2018 and have gone through multiple bottles. I've tried many sunscreens, but I always seem to come back to this.

Ingredients:All-physical filters, no fragrance or alcohol, not dehydrating on my skin, nice staying power, white cast is very, very slight for an all-physical spf. Also has some nice ""extra"" ings like vitamin C derivatives, but NO niacinamide. [Ingredients listed here](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_dd4d267869.html)

**Texture/feel:**If you tried and/or liked Sunkiller Baby Milk, you will also like this. Very siliconey, dries to a natural finish, minimal white cast for a physical SPF. Thin, white, milky formula that is easy to apply the full 1/4 teaspoon, especially if you do two thinner layers as opposed to one thicker one. It has all the aspects I liked about [Topix Replenix spray](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_983a404566.html), but it dries down much better (Topix took FOREVER to dry down, and then was slightly drying/dehydrating when it did). Somewhat similar to Etude House Mild Airy Finish. It's not as weightless as the EH, but definitely less drying and no fragrance.

**Best price:**You can find it listed on Amazon at a great price point (about $7 at the moment) as:Japan Health and Personal Care - Mentholatum San Play Baby Milk SPF34 PA +++ 30g \*AF27\*If you just do a search, you'll come up with prices of $20. Unfortunately, this listing is weird and spelled wrong, so it doesn't come up in a search.

I also saw it on [Amazon.jp](https://Amazon.jp) for like $4, though I haven't shopped there myself yet.

**Cons:**A minor complaint is that the packaging is small and not very elegant. It's easy to use with the typical nozzle, but doesn't look great in my medicine cabinet. Minor detail. Take a look at Ratzilla's overview of this product to make sure you're getting the latest packaging/formula.

A real complaint is that the SPF/PA aren't especially high, and there is a tiny bit of a white cast, but it doesn't annoy my sensitive skin and is cosmetically elegant, so unless I find a chemical SPF I can tolerate or a physical one that leaves absolutely no white cast, I'll keep repurchasing.

I would also like it if this were slightly more moisturizing (it's slightly less so than Klairs Soft Airy UV Essence, for example), so it could double as a moisturizer and I could skip a step. However, I definitely wouldn't call this drying.

**Thoughts:**I'm really excited about the new trend in AB for simple formulas with no irritating ingredients. I'm hoping this trend will result in some new spf formulas to try! But unless I find something better at this price point, I'm sticking with the Sunplay.",1565190612.0,1.0,12

[Review] 13 month review of Shu Uemura Ultime8 and Anti/Oxi+,"Critiques are gratefully appreciated! I made [a blog post again here](https://captainfatcat.wordpress.com/2019/08/06/shu-uemura-oil-cleansers-ultime8-and-anti-oxi/). I make no money from it, so you don't have to click if you don't want to, so I re-summarize below, except somehow I feel like I might like this post a bit more than my blog post. Any criticism is appreciated! Even if it's just my writing style, I'd like to get better with writing blog posts. I feel like I need to fix up my page now since I've accumulated a few more articles.. 

\---------------------------------------

&#x200B;

I'll admit that I am a bit of a fan girl of Shu Uemura oil cleansers. These are made with corn germ oil, not mineral oil. Corn germ oil is considered safer for sensitive skin than mineral oil because it is a naturally occurring oil, so it is a safe place to start. 

[Best Net has an article about oil cleansers](https://my-best.net/15468/) (I'm just a fan of their page). And I do agree with them about their review of these oil cleansers, except I think that they remove tough makeup just as if not more than some of the other ones. 

[Best Net for Ultime8](https://my-best.net/18306/)

[Best Net for Anti/Oxi+](https://my-best.net/18343/)

[More reading](http://thebeautylookbook.com/2017/08/shu-uemura-cleansing-oils.html)

[More reading 2](https://dailyvanity.sg/beauty-reviews/shu-uemura-cleansing-oil-review/)

I've been using these for 13 months now and I can understand some criticisms of it, however I feel like this oil cleanser just might not be a good fit for the rest of their routine. The simpler your routine is, the easier is it to see the benefits so that you can determine how to best make use of it. 

&#x200B;

**What I've noticed:**

1. They are both very hydrating, Ultime8 a bit more than Anti/Oxi+
2. Ultime8 is a little thicker in consistency, removes tough makeup a little easier than Anti/Oxi+
3. Anti/Oxi+ does feel calming and brightening 
4. Ultime8 helps clear pores and cleans sebaceous filaments a little better than Anti/Oxi+ and does feel like it helps with global skin concerns

**Proofs:**

I've been able to take some time without touching my face much, and after using a very minimal cleansing water + face cream for one month, my skin turned to a more raw state. After I was able to easily tell what this cleanser can do for my skin. 

Random DHC mention: 

>!During this time, I learned that I do not like the DHC cleansing oil. In fact, I dumped it in my dried up car air freshener and it revived it so well that I like it for that purpose. I was too annoyed by it that I after using it to cleanse my body, I didn't want to be bothered by it anymore. DHC's does need a second cleanse but my skin as softer, more moist, and brighter with Shu Uemura's oil cleansers.!<

Illi Total Aging Care mention:

>!I used this one for a year and a half and I enjoyed using it (I also really liked the smell). I feel like Shu Uemura's made a bigger difference in my skin. The sebaceous filaments have finally gone while using the Shu Uemura! !<

&#x200B;

**Basically, these DO what the claims are.** 

Ultime8 helps with pores and global skin concerns

Anti/Oxi+ helps brighten from stains as well as calming the skin from micro-pollutants 

*I feel like of all criticisms, we can all at least agree that this oil cleanser is very moisturizing and that you don't need a second cleans.*

If I had to choose only one, I might go for the Anti/Oxi+ because I have other products that help me keep my pores looking good, but Ultime8 really helps with hydrating. My moisturizing steps have stepped back a bit in terms of strict moisturizing, so if I were to cut Ultime8 out entirely, I might have to change something in my routine during the winter. 

It's a hard decision choosing between these two because they work together very well. Brightening and pore care. 

&#x200B;

**Will it work for your skin type?**

These two are the most popular for normal, dry, and/or sensitive skin. If your skin is oily, I have still heard some employees recommend the Ultime8 because it is ""better"" than the porefinist, which I think I can see why-- overall it's a nicer formula, however the porefinist does do a good job with targeting access oil production, so it can be a bit of a toss up to choose one or the other >!I've used the porefinist a bit as of writing this.!<It feels a little excessive to me to have two large bottles on my counter, and I really wish I could just have one but.. they work really well in pairs. I'm planning to talk about pairing and mixing/matching later.

&#x200B;

**Cost:**

Without looking at the price, I would continue to repurchase.

Even though this can be more expensive than other cleansers depending on sales and your location, I feel like you can save costs in other areas, like your second cleanse, time from not doing a second cleanse every day, and moisture. I can put more efforts in my moisture steps towards other concerns and have fewer moisture steps. In the end it ends up being cheaper.

&#x200B;

**Price comparisons:**

[Illi has been discontinued but I remember prices varied between $28 and $35 when I was buying them. If you'd like, I can add some more data to this.](https://i.redd.it/utcibh4ivve31.png)

I've recently purchased the PoreFinist and the Blanc:Chroma, so I'm looking into seeing which one/s of all their cleansers I prefer and how they mix/match.

[Discussion] Japanese shopping sites,"I know a lot of people use english websites but for those who use japanese ones like amazon and rakuten, which do you prefer?

I notice that while amazon has a wide range of products, not just skincare so you can buy all at once, they like to separate shipments so it just adds to shipping costs overseas since they're 2 boxes (if you use forwarding services like me). If your things are small they'll sometimes use a box that fits your stuff perfectly, but most of the time they use their infamous giantass box with the stuff taped to the bottom with a lot of extra space. I keep track of item weight to not go over my shipping limit and the big box tends to weigh around 450g+.

Recently they stopped selling some stuff to move over to amazon pantry (they're cheap and all but their fixed box dimension exceeds my overseas shipping requirement). I resorted to Rakuten (kenko) and their boxes are 150g+. I don't know how they pack it since it hasn't arrived but taking into account the weight of the boxes, is amazon or rakuten more cost effective? The rakuten store has free shipping over 3500 yen and some coupons around 100 yen. And sometimes bonus points. While amazon only has discounts and points for certain items. I'm starting to think I'm dumb for using amazon when rakuten is lighter thus saves on overseas shipping. Prices vary a few hundred yen. Some cheaper on amazon some rakuten.",1565032535.0,0.85,16

So I ordered from Stylevana...,"Like some others on this sub, I was intrigued by the site Stylevana, which seemed to have popped up out of nowhere & had some incredibly low prices on a lot of AB products (3ce eyeshadows for ~4$ USD, Tonymoly sheetmasks for ~0.50$ USD). Because there are so few reviews about this site, I've decided to my experience with the site here for others' benefits.

I made my original order on 07/22/19 and it arrived on 08/05/19. I spent enough to get free shipping (35$ USD) but I opted to pay the extra 2$ for the insured shipping method. Honestly, the reason I was okay with trying this website is because you pay via Paypal, which has a buyer protection policy. I didn't have any issues when I made my order, aside from the fact that the site kept prompting me to use promo codes for 10%-15% off my order, only for the site to say the codes were invalid once I entered them. I also want to note that despite all of the products being labeled ""Usually ships out within 24 hours"", my order wasn't shipped out until 07/31/19.

While I've seen other people mention that their orders never arrived, mine did, and overall it seems fine. It did come with a weird letter addressed to the air carrier certifying that it contained ""non-hazardous goods"", which I've never seen before when ordering AB. All of the products seem legitimate, with the Tonymoly mask packaging being exactly the same as my other masks from them, and all the 3ce products have authenticity stickers. 

The only legitimate issue with my order is with the Etude House Play Color Eyes palette in Cherry Blossom, which arrived with one broken shadow. I've contacted Stylevana to see if they'll do a refund, but in all honesty its 1 broken shadow out of 10, so I'm not that upset.

My order did come with 1 sample, a little packet for the Missha Aqua Peptide Custom Skin Care 99 Cream, in case anyone was wondering.

Overall, it was an okay experience, and I can at least verify the site isn't a scam site. I'll keep you guys posted on whether or not they'll issue a refund on the Etude House palette.  I ordered 4 other 3CE single shadows, none of which came broken, but I would hesitate to buy anything fragile from them in the future. My order came wrapped in 1 sheet of bubble wrap, and none of the individual powders or palettes were wrapped individually, so I'm kind of shocked only 1 powder was broken. 
 I'm curious to hear about anyone else's experience with this site & to see if they'll maintain the low prices in the future. If you guys have any questions about my order & anything I didn't mention feel free to ask!!",1565028629.0,0.95,30

Sunscreens for oily skin in tropical climates (and a few reviews),"What are your favourite sunscreens for very oily skin, which can be used without powder or blotting? It's often a struggle to get enough sunscreen on because too much can leave me looking greasy. It seems like my skin isn't very absorbent to creams, and they just sit on top and never dry. Plus, oil blotting seems like it'd suck up the sunscreen filters and render it less effective.

I don't mind alcohol in my sunscreen, but I would prefer an unfragranced/less fragranced formulation. I use tretinoin daily, so I would prefer high PA and SPF ratings. I feel like my problem isn't really oiliness, but that my skin isn't absorbent... I apply sunscreen with no products except toner underneath.

Sorry if this has been asked before, but my search results turned up a thread from about a year ago so I thought I'd source for new opinions.

 I've tried:

\- *Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence*: Potentially unpopular opinion, but this left me shiny as a disco ball, with a layer of oil on my skin that never seemed to absorb even after hours of sitting around. I powdered my face, but oil seemed to seep through after just under an hour. It's sticky and catches hair as reliably as applying lipgloss on your entire face would. It pills relentlessly under makeup too...

&#x200B;

\- *Canmake* *Mermaid Skin Gel*: Similar to above, if somewhat lighter than the Biore. Leaves a shiny and unnatural film that never seems to absorb. Bearable, but impossible to wear naturally without face powder.

&#x200B;

\- *Shigaisen Yohou UV Gel*: Light, hydrating gel that seemed easily absorbed on the back of my hand, but proved impossible to absorb when applied in sufficient quantities on the face. Also not ideal because it was only PA +++

&#x200B;

\- *Shiseido Anessa**, Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk*: The only sunscreen I've been able to wear daily (for over half a year now). This dries down satisfactorily, but can be sticky if I put too much on. Has a nice satin finish that sustains for several hours, I do get slightly shiny by the end of the day. If I don't find a better recommendation, I would stick with this.

&#x200B;

\- *Innisfree* *Perfect UV protection cream* *Triple Care*: Leave a visible white cast. Satin finish, but when applied in sufficient quantities, the cream seemed to clog my pores, leaving behind small bumps. My skin seems to tolerate better the alcohol-heavy liquid formulation of the Anessa.",1564919198.0,0.97,148

Is Chinese skincare creeping up on us? Do you care?,"\[Reposting from another sub\]

Korean skincare has crept its way into every market globally by now, but after reading this article by [Daily Vanity](https://dailyvanity.sg/news/china-beauty-brands/), it got me curious.

**Will there be a beauty war between China and Korea?**

I think it's plausible. There are more than a few Chinese brands that have been around for over 100 years, and use medicinal ingredients in their products (I like the sound of that).

But my main question is this.

If I sourced the best Chinese skincare products, opened an online store and sold them to you, the Skincare Addict Army, at an extremely affordable price, **would you buy them?**

Would it even spark your interest? Or is it too big a leap of faith to even consider?

Personally I think the Asian Beauty trend is here to stay, and it's inevitable that China will be taking a spot as one of the top producers of skin care products in future.",1564855228.0,0.71,70

[Review] Purito Centella Green Level Unscented Sunscreen,"This was my first time using a non-Western sunscreen and I don't think I can come back to that ever again. I already tried a Purito product that worked well for me so I was pretty excited about their new unscented version of the sunscreen. The consitency of the sunscreen is very similar (if not the same) as a light moisturizer. It applied very nicely and was pretty hydrating. I didn't seem to experience any pilling when applied over my other skincare products, so if you do apply makeup over this sunscreen you'd probably be safe. After applying, it left no whitecast (I have a lighter skintone with yellow undertones) or any greasy residue on my face. Most sunscreens I wear leave a gross sunscreen smell on my skin, but as advertised this one left no scent. It also doesn't contain any essential oils like its counterpart, so anyone sensitive skin would have a safer time trying out this version. I would recommend this sunscreen and would purchase it again for myself. If anyone has a question, feel free to ask :)

Cake Day Reviews! 4 years on this sub!,"I, at 10 pm, just realized it's almost my cake day! I've been on Reddit for five years now but the oldest post I could find on this sub was 4 years ago, so maybe I was a lurker? Anyways, to commemorate the real reason I even get on this site, I am going to give mini reviews for some of the products I've tried over the last four years! Let's get right into it!

&#x200B;

***Skin Type:*** Dehydrated/Combo, acne prone but well controlled with my routine, some hyper-pigmentation left from old acne.

&#x200B;

* Item I loved the most: Japanese Biore Body Wash. I don't use it on my face, but I have yet to find a body wash as amazing as this one.

&#x200B;

* Item I loved the least: COSRX A-Sol. Gave me the absolute worst breakout of my life. I have never forgotten how horrible my skin looked. I cried. It was that bad.

&#x200B;

One of my first ever AB products was the **Etude House Wonder Pore Toner** if I remember correctly. I was a packaging SUCKER back then. Didn't matter if the pH was high or it didn't work; It was always packaging FTW. This toner didn't do much for me and I remember putting so much more on the cotton pad towards the end just to get rid of it. It resembled more of a western toner which I am completely turned off to at this point in my skincare journey.

&#x200B;

**Etude House Collagen Under Eye Patches** were and still are HG status! They are the only under eye masks that actually plump up my eyes and make me look put together. Not the least wasteful packaging, but honestly I've tried the 60 count jars from other brands and they just don't stack up for me.

&#x200B;

**Etude House Soon Jung 5.5 pH Toner** once again HG! I have dehydrated skin that gets easily irritated from being touched and this calms it all the way down. I am a serial product switcher if I'm not absolutely in love with something and I have not bought any other toner in months, probably over a year now.

&#x200B;

**Etude House Soon Jung Foaming Cleanser** is just WOW. I use it right before the toner from the same line and I love it. Cleanses well but doesn't strip my skin which I seriously need. Sometimes cleansers that are meant to hydrate leave a film behind and this one doesn't. I have yet to see someone that doesn't love this cleanser that doesn't react to it.

&#x200B;

**Lululun Sheet masks** of all kinds, honestly. I consider myself still to this day a sheetmask ku-ween. I sheetmask daily (yes, I already know what you're going to say) and I have tried SO many scents and types that I just can't remember them all (really wish I could. That'd be one heck of a review post). I make it my mission to try every single type of Lululun regional mask I can get my hands on. So far I love the Hokkaido melon! If anyone knows anywhere to find the regional types, holla at ya girl.

&#x200B;

**Saborino Morning Masks**. GIRL. I don't want to give away too much as I am literally in the middle of a review on my blog for these, but the hype is REAL.

&#x200B;

**Mediheal Aquaring and AC Dressing** **masks**. All types of yesses. YAAAS, YEEEEEEEEES, and even guuuuuuuuuurl. If you can manage to get the Line Friends versions of these, OMG too cute. They fit my face well, hydrate, and brighten. They are the middle of the road when it comes to sheet masks but, man, do these work. No frills, not heavily fragranced (I don't really remember a fragrance at all but don't quote me), and they will not disappoint. I'm trying to make a habit of buying bulk sheet masks so I don't buy these as much as I used to, but if I do buy single masks, these are always the first ones I go for.

&#x200B;

**COSRX Low BHA Overnight Mask** is weird for me. I like it a lot, I really do. It is a great occlusive that leaves my skin super soft in the morning, but for some reason I still want to try something else. I typically only feel that way about items I DO NOT like, but this is still something I reach for. Yeah, I dunno. But I still recommend it!

&#x200B;

**Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask** is worth the price in it's scent alone. In real life, I don't like ginger in anything. Seeing it in the store makes me cringe. This, on the other hand, I can't get enough of. It calms my skin, making it bright and plump in the morning.

&#x200B;

**Keana Rice Sheet Masks** are great if you can get past the super easy to tear mask. I like to stretch my asks a bit to fit the sides of my face and this one doesn't have much give. They work well, absorb into the skin like magic, and hydrate decently well. They don't brighten as much as I'd expect, but they're still pretty good for bulk masks.

&#x200B;

**Rael Acne Patches**. WOW these are amazing. I don't think the brand is knowingly AB (or that I am sure of), but the patches are made in Korea and blow the COSRX ones out of the water. They stay on your skin even AFTER a full routine and actually pull out gunk. I'm waiting to work through my A'pieu needle spot patches so I can try the needle patch version from Rael.

&#x200B;

**Giibon Skincare Essence**. This is a HA heavy serum that I got to review for Jolse and I ended up loving it. So much so that I repurchased when I ran out. Without it, my skin just doesn't have any life in it. And to think I would have never purchased it otherwise. This product got me excited about trying more lesser known AB brands (to me at least).

&#x200B;

These are just some of the items I'm loving and using right now that I can remember off of the top of my head. I will be updating my blog with more in-depth reviews for all of the items currently in my routine, but for now, these are some of the things I am loving. Feel free to ask me questions about any of the items in my mini-reviews!",1564803078.0,0.94,11

what do you like about asian beauty makeup products and trends?,"and, what are some of your favourite asian beauty looks, and what do you use or how do you achieve them? do you like to add your own twists to them? do you sometimes use western beauty products to achieve an asian beauty look?

for example, the korean gradient lip is a very popular trend, but one that i think is lesser known that i really enjoy is the blotted matte full lip, with a faint blurred overlining on the cupid's bow. for this i love using innisfree's vivid cotton ink, but really any creamy bullet lipstick (ab or not) can give the same end effect. another trend i love is the igari-style draped blush, except sometimes, instead of blush i'll use a shimmery bronzer, and fleck some freckles in afterwards.

im also super curious; how many of you that enjoy wearing asian products or styles are not asian by race? does it affect how you wear asian beauty?",1564672393.0,0.91,28

Gluthatione,Why is no one talking about this ingredient? I use Cathy doll Aura whitening serum + foam cleanser which has Gluthatione as a main ingredient. Gluthatione literally healed my inflammated acne in just a day and have never gotten one since using it after 2 months. It also removed dark spot on my face. It didn't reduce the redness tho. It also whitened my skin and healed minor acne scars. It definitely didn't prevent zits from coming out but it still slowed it down. So yeah I haven't seen anyone recommend gluthatione here yet.,1564656995.0,0.7,15
"[Research] Centella Asiatica & Vitamin C May Work Better When Combined Together (Plus, Added Bonus - Glycolic Acid)","Centella Asiatica is well known for its anti-oxidant, anti-ageing, and wound healing properties. Its effects are thought to be largely due to various saponins contained within Centella Asiatica extracts (e.g. madecassoside).

A number of studies that have investigated the wound healing benefits of Centella Asiatica have found that topical application of the extract increases the production of collagen.

Another well-known antioxidant that promotes wound-healing and boosts collagen production is vitamin C (in fact, vitamin C is possibly *the* best-known stimulator of collagen).

So, if both Centella Asiatica and vitamin c are antioxidants, collagen boosters, and wound healing enhancers, do they enhance each other's effects and work better together?

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18503551/) found that a topical combination of vitamin C and a Centella Asiatica extract significantly improved skin suppleness, firmness, and hydration, as well as improving the appearance of wrinkles, after 6 weeks of use.

As it turns out, this is, indeed, an additive effect.

The additive effect of vitamin C and Centella Asiatica was demonstrated in [this study](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Puziah_Hashim4/publication/260431233_The_effect_of_Centella_asiatica_vitamins_glycolic_acid_and_their_mixtures_preparations_in_stimulating_collagen_and_fibronectin_synthesis_in_cultured_human_skin_fibroblast/links/564aaf6208ae44e7a28dd030.pdf) that incubated human skin (human foreskins to be precise) for 48 hours. The skin samples were incubated with Centella Asiatica, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, and their combinations.

Each ingredient, alone, increased the production of collagen two-fold. In addition, when vitamin C alone, as well as in combination with vitamins A and E, was combined with Centella Asiatica, collagen production increased three-fold.

Basically, the addition of vitamins A, C, and E to Centella Asiatica didn't increase the production of collagen anymore than when vitamin C was added to Centella Asiatica on its own.

In addition, glycolic acid (another known collagen-booster) enhanced this combination further. Glycolic acid, alone, boosted collagen production two-fold. When combined with Centella Asiatica, it boosted collagen production three-fold, and when all three (Centella Asiatica, vitamin c, and glycolic acid) were combined together, collagen production was enhanced four-fold.

To illustrate this more clearly, here are the various ingredients, their combinations, and how much each ingredient/combination increased collagen production by:

* Vitamin A - 2x
* Vitamin C - 2x
* Vitamin E - 2x
* Centella Asiatica - 2x
* Glycolic Acid - 2x
* Centella Asiatica & Vitamin C - 3x
* Centella Asiatica & Vitamin A & Vitamin C & Vitamin E - 3x
* Centella Asiatica & Glycolic Acid - 3x
* Centella Asiatica & Vitamin C & Glycolic Acid - 4x

This study is an excellent example of how some skincare ingredients can have additive effects when combined together, and I thought some of the Centella Asiatica enthusiasts among you may find it interesting.

"Non-drying second cleansers from Muji, Chifure, Fancl, Mochitto (Ishizawa Laboratories), Sunsorit, and Curél","I’ve been trying out different second cleansers lately (first cleansers too, to a lesser extent), and thought I might share my thoughts especially since I don’t see most of these products on this sub. Most recently I got a bottle of the Mochitto cleanser (fourth product reviewed below), which I’ve seen rave reviews for on this sub as basically being the least drying cleanser ever. The Mochitto is now serving as a control in my very non-scientific study.

**The premise:** I have dry/dehydrated and sometimes sensitive skin, or maybe more like combination/dehydrated at the moment from my routine and the weather. I live in western Japan, which currently means high temperatures, with the highs around 36–37 °C (96.8–98.6 °F) these days, and high humidity (but not nearly as much as the rainy season, which is truly beyond humid). This also means I’m washing with soft water, which I’m sure makes some kind of a difference. I could probably benefit from using one of those ultra-gentle lotion-like cleansers, but I like to feel cleaner, especially since I sweat a lot in the summer.

**Disclaimers:** I apologize for any ingredient translation mistakes (and please let me know if you find one!). All prices are for purchases made within Japan and do not take any import costs or other mark-ups into consideration. Some of them might not be available outside of Japan, but I thought it might be interesting anyway for those of you who are living or traveling in Japan. And of course YMMV for everything.

Ratings: HG = holy grail, RP = would repurchase, WNR = will not repurchase.

In order of non-drying-ness (followed by two that I don’t have on hand and thus can’t rank):

&#x200B;

1.	**Muji Facial Wash Gel** (mild/moist)

**Link:** [Official website](https://www.muji.net/store/cmdty/detail/4550002867614) (link in Japanese)

**List price:** 790 JPY for 120 g (6.583333333 JPY per gram) or $7.06 USD for 4.23 oz. Travel size: 290 JPY for 30 g

**Rating:** RP, potential HG

Not to be confused with [\[Mild\] Gel Cleansing](https://www.muji.us/store/mild-gel-cleansing-4-23-oz-120g.html), which is a first cleanser. I think this is a new product because I can’t find much information even in Japanese. It’s a clear gel that smells lightly citrusy. You *are* supposed to lather it up before using it, but it’s very low-lather and doesn’t get very foamy. It washes off easily and my face feels almost squeaky clean afterward, but it isn’t stripping like you would think. I do feel ever so slightly dry/tight if I don’t move on to the rest of my routine right away, but that goes for all four of these cleansers, and the least for this one. I finished the travel-sized tube and am now using the full-sized one. It’s marketed as containing Lipidure (polyquaternium-51), apricot juice, peach leaf extract, and sodium hyaluronate for hydration, and being artificial fragrance-free, colorant-free, mineral oil-free, alcohol-free, and paraben-free. (ETA that it does contain orange oil, so steer clear if you’re sensitive to it.)

**Ingredients (my translation):** Water, Oleic Acid, Lauric Acid, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Potassium Hydroxide, Lauryl Hydroxysultaine, Propanediol, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Myristic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Polyquaternium-51, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Juice, Prunus Persica (Peach) Leaf Extract, Sodium Hyaluronate, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Sodium Chloride, Polyquaternium-50, Tetrasodium EDTA, Sodium Metabisulfite, Phenoxyethanol, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil

&#x200B;

2.	**Chifure Cleansing Foam** (moist)

**Link:** [Official website](https://www.chifure-global.com/skin_care/face_wash/cleansing_foam.html)

**List price:** 460 JPY for 150 g (3.066666667 JPY per gram) or $4.11 USD for 5.29 oz; tax excluded

**Rating:** Probably WNR unless I miss the foam

This is actually a great face wash if you’re looking for something really low-budget and/or want foam. It’s a white cream/paste that turns into a thick, super creamy bouncy foam (I do use [a net](https://www.muji.com/sg/products/cmdty/detail/4945247506488) for this; link for Muji but I’m sure they have something like it at Daiso etc. for even cheaper). My online research had me believing that foam = drying, which is what set me off on this quest in the first place, but this one is actually only slightly more drying than the Muji gel. It’s hard to find second cleansers that *don’t* have high lather because foam is popular in Japan—the creamier/bouncier the foam the better. Anyway, this one is marketed as containing amino acids for hydration and being fragrance-free, artificial colorant-free, and alcohol-free.

**Ingredients:** Water, Glycerin, Myristic Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Stearic Acid, Butylene Glycol, Lauric Acid, Palmitic Acid, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Glycol Distearate, Laurel Betaine, Sodium Lauroyl Methylaminopropionate, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Behenyl Alcohol, Poloxamer 215, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Polyquaternium-7, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium EDTA, Methylparaben, Propylparaben

&#x200B;

3.	**Fancl Deep Clear Face Wash Powder**

**Link:** [Official website](https://www.fancl.co.jp/beauty/item/3738a) (link in Japanese)

**List price:** 1944 JPY for 30 single-use packets (64.8 JPY per packet, not sure how many grams per packet) or $17.37 for 30 packets

**Rating:** Might RP

This is a new product, launched this May, and admittedly kind of hype-y at the moment. It’s a very fine black powder that comes in little creamer-like packets, similar to [the Suisai face wash](https://www.kanebo-cosmetics.jp/suisai/products/ferment/bcp/) (which I’ve also been meaning to try but haven’t yet). It turns into a gray foam—I use the net for this too, make sure to place your hand strategically so as not to let the powder fall through (don’t make fun of me, it happens!)—but the Chifure is actually more exciting foam-wise. It’s one of those oxygen enzyme cleansers that are supposed to clear out your pores. I actually find [Fancl Mild Cleansing Oil](https://www.fancl.com/shop/product_detail.php?products_id=312) (my current favorite first cleanser) more effective on that front, but it’s nice to feel like I’m delivering a one-two punch. It’s also surprisingly non-drying for what it is. Pros: It’s a powder *and* it comes in single-use packets, which is great because I’m only using this maybe once a week and will have it sitting around for quite a while. (It needs to be used as soon as the packet is opened but lasts up to *3 years* unopened.) This will also be convenient for short trips. Cons: Slightly expensive, more plastic waste. Marketed as containing oxygen (protease), charcoal, clay, amino acid-based cleansing ingredients, sugars, and hyaluronic acid, and as being preservative-free, fragrance-free, artificial colorant-free, petroleum-based surfactant-free, and chemical UV filter-free.

**Ingredients (my translation):** Potassium Cocoyl Glycinate, Mannitol, Sodium Cocoyl/Palmoyl/Sunfloweroyl Glutamate, PEG-75, Dextrin, Pullulan, Sodium Lauroyl Glutamate, Sodium Myristate, Agar, Pyrophyllite, Potassium Myristate, Hydroxypropyl Starch Phosphate, Alpha-Glucan, Talc, Quartz, Sodium Laurate, Behenyl Alcohol, Potassium Laurate, Protease, Charcoal Powder, Sodium Hyaluronate, Silica, Sodium Palmitate, Zea Mays (Corn) Starch, Stearic Acid, Potassium Palmitate, Lauric Acid, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Glycerin, Allantoin, Disodium Phosphate, Potassium Phosphate, Iron Oxide

&#x200B;

4.	Ishizawa Laboratories **Mochitto Awadate-Irazu Face Wash Without Bubbling**

**Links:** [Official website](https://www.ishizawa-lab.co.jp/mochitto/wash.html) (link in Japanese), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/mochitto-awadate-irazu-face-wash/)

**List price:** 1296 JPY for 180 ml (7.2 JPY per ml) or $11.58 USD for 6.09 fl oz

**Rating:** WNR

[This product will be discontinued soon](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/cjl3aq/mochitto_awadateirazu_face_wash_and_mochitto/), and it seems like practically everyone who knows what it is (granted, not a lot of you) is mourning over it. But as I said in that post, I actually find this to be the *most* drying of all these second cleansers. I was kind of shocked because I had such high expectations for this one. It was kind of hard to find too, even here in Japan. For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, it’s a clear lotion-like cleanser that you can use straight out of the bottle without lathering it up first. It does produce a little bit of lather as you use it on your face. It’s advertised as mostly (97%) consisting of rice-based essence-type ingredients, being safe for babies, and being mineral oil-free, alcohol-free, colorant-free, and mildly acidic. *Mochi mochi* is an onomatopoeic word describing a soft, moist, bouncy texture (when used in reference to skin), by the way, obviously based on the food *mochi*. Same thing as *mochitto* and, probably most commonly, *mocchiri*.

**Ingredients (my translation):** Water, Sorbitol, Glycerin, PPG-9 Diglyceryl Ether, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Extract, Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Soluble Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, Ceramide NS, Glutamic Acid, Alanine, Arginine, Glycine, Citric Acid, Serine, Threonine, Proline, Lysine, Polyglyceryl-10 Eicosanedioate/Tetradecanedioate, Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Hydroxide, Betaine, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate, Butylene Glycol, Dipropylene Glycol, Sodium PCA, PPG-4-Ceteth-20, Caramel, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Alcohol

&#x200B;

I’m sure the Mochitto isn’t drying as face washes in general go, but it really gave me perspective on just how non-drying the other ones are. I was kind of losing sight, almost like I was forgetting how it *actually* feels to be dried out by a cleanser, because my two previous second cleansers were non-drying too. I bought the cleansers above after running out of these so I’m not sure where they would go in the ranking (somewhere above the Mochitto, definitely), but in case anyone’s interested:

&#x200B;

**Sunsorit Skin Peel Bar: Hydroquinol**

**Link:** [Official website](https://www.sunsorit.co.jp/shop/lineup/spb-peeling/spb-hydro/) (link in Japanese)

**List price:** 5000 JPY for 135 g (37.037037037 per gram) or $44.67 USD for 4.76 oz; tax excluded

**Rating:** Could be HG if it weren’t for the price

The Sunsorit bar soaps are very high quality. There are four different types, all containing AHA. The red version, [Skin Peel Bar: Tea Tree](https://www.sunsorit.co.jp/shop/lineup/spb-peeling/spb-teatree/) with 1% AHA and tea tree oil, was one of the only things I used that really helped when I had my second bad round of acne in my early/mid-twenties. That one costs 2500 JPY, or half as much as this version (still pretty expensive, I know). The blue version (mild AHA) and green version (AHA) cost 2000 JPY. So this black version is especially expensive, but it also has the most different types of active ingredients. I think it’s the only one that also contains BHA in addition to AHA, and as the name indicates, it contains hydroquinone too. I never really cared about brightening in the past, but my face is currently darker than my body and I would’ve liked to try using this one for longer, but currently can’t afford it. There are mini sizes available too, by the way, which is how I tried this one. Note that these soaps melt easily, so you definitely don’t want to store them in your shower. It’s a good idea to cut off a small piece for use and to put the rest away in a dry, cool place. Also, there are places that sell it for much cheaper, but I suspect this product is expensive enough for there to be fakes, so make sure to read the vendor’s reviews.

**Ingredients (my translation):** Triethanolamine, Stearic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide, Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Water, Arctostaphylos Uva-Ursi (Bearberry) Extract, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Fruit Extract, Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, Glycerin, Charcoal, Glycolic Acid, Salicylic Acid, Hydroquinone

&#x200B;

Kao **Curél Intensive Moisture Care Foaming Wash**

**Links:** [Official website](https://www.kao.com/jp/en/curel/crl_facewash_00.html), [RatzillaCosme](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/curel-foaming-wash/)

**List price:** None given; 1296 JPY on Amazon.co.jp for 150 ml in pump (8.64 JPY per ml) or $11.58 USD for 5.07 fl oz, 1026 JPY on Amazon.co.jp for 130 ml refill pouch

**Rating:** Former HG, RP if my face freaks out and I need something super gentle

This one is actually also really good but I decided to try other products because of the foam thing. I think the Curél is probably the best choice for sensitive skin out of all the products I’ve mentioned. I don’t have it right now so I haven’t compared it with the products above directly, but I did use two or three bottles in a row. It’s one of those pre-foamed cleansers that are dispensed as foam from a pump. The foam is much less creamy/bouncy when compared to the Chifure and even the Fancl. It’s very gentle—I use a lot of Curél products and wouldn’t expect any less from them—and the ingredients are probably more sensitive skin friendly than the other products. It’s marketed as cleansing while protecting your ceramides, and being fragrance-free, colorant-free, alcohol-free (no ethyl alcohol added), mildly acidic, etc.

Mini-Review of Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence Mint Green,"Ok, don't color me green, color me underwhelmed. I had such high hopes for this sunscreen but I don't think I will be repurchasing it. For reference, I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to redness and allergic reactions but not acne, and a fair complexion with lots of sun damage and freckles.

&#x200B;

Claims: Color corrects redness, SPF50+/PA++++

&#x200B;

UV Filters: Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinul T150 & Titanium Dioxide

&#x200B;

Free from: Mineral oil, parabens, alcohol

&#x200B;

Enhanced with Hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, blue green pigment, microfine strobe pearl particles

&#x200B;

First impressions: Big tube for the price (compared to my HG Canmake Mermaid Skin) on Ebay I paid around $13 for a 80g tube. So not as cheap as my beloved Etude House SunPrise Mild Airy Finish (can we make these names just a bit longer please), but not as expensive as Klairs or Annessa.  I like the kind of metallic ombre blue to green effect of the packaging, but it gets really messy looking if you grab it with sunscreen-ed fingers.

&#x200B;

How does it apply/wear: It is a thick cream. Seeing how it is labeled as an essence, I was expecting something along the texture of Biore UV Watery Essence. Nope. Thick. Green. Really hard to spread. I apply my sunscreen with a teardrop silicone applicator, and it caused the applicator to feel like it was sticking to my skin, so I had to switch to my fingers. I apply the recommended 1/4 teaspoon, and at first I thought no way, I'm going to look like a weird alien in clown makeup. It did eventually blend in, but if you aren't diligent with spreading it you will have blobs of light green/white. Around the hairline, eyebrows, nasolabial folds are the worst spots.  The second or third time I wore it I tried applying two layers of half of the amount about 5 minutes apart, made it even harder to spread.

&#x200B;

Once I got it blended, I observed my disco shiny face and thought ""I'll give it 10 minutes to dry down and I'll look fabulous."" Again, nope. 10 minutes later, still glowing like a light bulb. 20 minutes, 30, 40...... it took a full hour to not look like I had greased my face up with bacon fat. But, I actually loved the finish after it dried down. Kind of a, how to describe it, Barbie doll skin finish. Not quite dewy, but almost glass like. As far as color correcting, who knows. It didn't make enough of a difference to jump on a couch for.  Upon reapplication, I had to go through the same ordeal of spreading and waiting. After the second application, even more of that cool Barbie doll skin effect. It definitely seems to smooth out pores and fine lines.

&#x200B;

I wore it under some light BB cream, seemed fine. However, I did not reapply that day. There is no way to reapply this stuff over makeup without redoing your whole face.

&#x200B;

Is it effective: I don't try to get a sunburn, so I can't tell how effective it is with prolonged sun exposure. However, I did have to stand around in the sun for about 10 minutes and drove around for about 2 hours, and didn't observe any flushing or new sun damage (it only takes me 10 minutes to get a sunburn BTW). 

&#x200B;

Final thoughts: While I enjoy my Barbie skin, it takes forever to spread and dry down. If I'm going to be hanging out in my house for most of the day, fine. But I don't want to have to wait for an hour to not look like I stuck my face in a vat of oil. Not going to repurchase. If you want to try it, best for normal to dry skin. Oily skin probably wants to stay away.",1564499271.0,0.97,12

[review] Missha UV Pore Blur Starter," **Missha – UV Pore Blur Starter SPF50+/PA++++** 

Rating – 4/5 - Application and texture -  [https://imgur.com/a/sROcKga](https://imgur.com/a/sROcKga) 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Feel / Texture – Velvety and smooth to the touch. A little bit powdery. Experienced small flaking because of unshaved facial hair. (Contains Silicones)

Look – Very Matte, even my oil glands which produce a lot of oil at times does not show when using this. Blurs pores well and will make your skin dewy/ matte.

Skin Types – Oily/ Combination.

Scent – Not appealing, but fades after 1 -2 hours.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I bought this sunscreen/ primer after being sick of oily skin. I looked at the UV filters which I will get into in a moment and bought it because of the coverage it gave, while also having SEVERAL UV protective ingredients. After trying so many sunscreens and becoming an oil slick after the first 3 hours, I gave this sunscreen a go. On first application I could noticeably tell a difference, my skin was brighter, matte to the touch and my sebum production s did not seep through my skin like it would with other sunscreens. I can’t rave enough about how mattifying and pore blurring this sunscreen is. Despite this, I would save this sunscreen for special occasions, since if your skin is too dry, it will pill and dry your skin more. I would recommend this to people who have a good moisture barrier!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Notable Ingredients**

**UV Protection** – Zinc Oxide (Anti- septic and anti – inflammatory, while also controlling oil),[ Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/c0e748279.html),[ Titanium Dioxide](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/76298d372.html),[ Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/981df410268.html),[ Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/f1c1412978.html).

These ingredients protect against both UVA and UVB light, which prevents anti- aging.

**Ingredients to look out for** – Dimethicone, and Steraic Acid (which can clog pores for some,  but I’ve never experienced this issue).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Final Thoughts**

I bought this sunscreen / primer trying to control my sebum production throughout the day and it did not disappoint. It keep my overly oily skin matte, for the whole day, and does not clog my pores. It can feel drying though so if you're skin isn't hydrated/flakes/ or has a compromised moisture barrier I would try save it for special occasions, or days I go out.",1564474251.0,0.95,16

Mochitto Awadate-Irazu face wash and Mochitto Kansou-Shirazu lotion to be discontinued,"According to Ishizawa Laboratories’ official website, [Mochitto Awadate-Irazu Face Wash Without Bubbling](https://www.ishizawa-lab.co.jp/mochitto/wash.html) (also known as Mochitto Mochi Mochi Awadate-Irazu Face Wash Without Bubbling; [RatzillaCosme page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/mochitto-awadate-irazu-face-wash/)) and [Mochitto Kansou-Shirazu Face Lotion Without Drying](https://www.ishizawa-lab.co.jp/mochitto/lotion.html) ([RatzillaCosme page](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/skin/mochitto-kansou-shirazu-face-lotion/)) will be discontinued at the end of August (“2019年8月末　販売終了予定”).

…I know no one has posted about the face wash for a whole year (and no posts about the lotion), and that most people probably won’t even know what it is, but I figured I would mention it anyway since I learned about it here. It’s a second cleanser that doesn’t require foaming up before use (it does produce a bit of foam on your face, but the point is that you don’t do it beforehand and can use it straight from the bottle). It contains a bunch of rice-derived ingredients and sounds incredibly hydrating in the reviews I’ve seen here.

I finally got a bottle of the face wash yesterday, only to find out about this. Personally I have to say I’m pretty indifferent, though, since I actually find my other second cleansers less drying, but anyway, just FYI.",1564452255.0,0.99,18

"[Regional] Sulwhasoo Spa vs History of Whoo Spa in Seoul, SK","I just returned from a trip to South Korea and I'd like to recognize the awesome experiences I had at two different spas while I was there. I went to the Sulwhasoo spa my first weekend, and the History of Whoo Spa my last weekend. They were very different but fun experiences.

Sulwhasoo

* Booked a 2.5 hour spa treatment through Klook.com, but found out I could have booked directly with the Spa (Sulwhasoo Flagship Store) as they have English speaking staff on hand.
* Spa is located in Gangnam, a bit of a walk from the closest train station. Tucked away down an alley, but the store was easy to spot once I was close. It's about 4 floors, and they have English speaking staff.
* The Spa is located downstairs, and they brought me in immediately and had me fill out paperwork about my skin. They had upgrade options available (of course) with extra collagen masks. I ended up going with it because why not. They gave me a lovely warm tea and some kind of cracker.
* They decided that my skin concerns would benefit from the Time Treasure line. 
* They took me to a private room where I disrobed and was put into a footbath. Once that was over, they brought me to the table for a full body massage. It was quite relaxing and lasted for about an hour. She did a stomach massage and I ended up feeling quite gassy almost immediately afterwards. I think my colon was cleansed for a few days so I guess that's a plus?
* The facial session took quite a while. Each step was meticulous and a lot of sheet masks and absorbing maskings were used. There were times when everything except my nose was covered so anyone who is claustrophobic you might want to be wary of this. 
* These are my results immediately after: [Front](https://i.imgur.com/04lu3ra.jpg) :: [Side 1](https://i.imgur.com/1x4q61v.jpg) :: [Side 2](https://i.imgur.com/KBWxPOs.jpg) 
* With the treatment I received a 10% discount to use in the store. I checked the prices and for the time treasure set, it was significantly cheaper with the discount to purchase than through a US store. On top of that they gave me a metric ton of samples.
* [Purchase 1](https://i.imgur.com/Gp5Z0p0.jpg) :: [Purchase 2](https://i.imgur.com/IHw2M6D.jpg)
* In total the session was $240 and the purchases were $390. Overall I thought it was pretty good experience. My skin felt amazing for two weeks afterwards until my next spa treatment. 

History of Whoo

* Booked a 3.5 hour spa treatment through Klook.com. Also discovered I could book directly with them as they have English speaking staff on hand as well. Was about a 10 minute walk from the closest train station. It's extremely uphill so people with walking issues might want to use a taxi (they're cheap in Seoul). 
* This is basically just a spa area, and they mentioned actors and actresses go there often before filming. Apparently I was lucky and an actress was there while I was getting my session.. never saw her haha. 
* They had me fill out a profile as well, and they decided the OHUI Prime Advancer line was best for my skin issues. They did use the HWAN YU Cream at the end.
* They took me to a small private room and I undressed and immediately was put on the table for a full body massage. That lasted for close to 1.5 hours. They did a stomach massage and again I think they cleansed my colon for the next week.
* Once they started the facial process, it seemed much shorter than at Sulwhasoo. It didn't feel like they gave my skin time to soak everything in, but maybe that was just my opinion. It was about 12 or 13 steps in the whole process and it finished with a collagen face mask for 25 minutes.
* This is what my skin looked like immediately after: [Front](https://i.imgur.com/UFWiugW.jpg) :: [Side 1](https://i.imgur.com/tNLP4ua.jpg) :: [Side 2](https://i.imgur.com/ZEwuMSN.jpg)
* This is what my skin looked like 2 hours later: [Front](https://i.imgur.com/7EuRxUK.jpg) :: [Side 1](https://i.imgur.com/3kiw70M.jpg) :: [Side 2](https://i.imgur.com/TvcySoH.jpg)

PM - Drunk Elephant Jelly Cleanser, AHA/BHA toner, BHA A-Sol, BHA Emulsion, Oil-Free Lotion, Prescribed acne lotion (for the big ones)

&#x200B;

**Context:**

For the past few years I've noticed my skin gets really oily, especially in the T-Zone area. I decided to get started on AB skincare with The Face Shop's [The Therapy Moisture Blending Formula Cream](https://ca.naturecollection.com/en/the-therapy-creme-formulee-d-un-melange-hydratant.html) along with a toner and serum from the same brand/line. I asked the store associates for their recommendations for oily/combo skin and that's what they provided. I found them to be pretty moisturizing and thought the oily skin was due to dehydration. This was not the case!! It had gotten so bad that I was carrying around oil-blotting paper DURING CANADIAN WINTERS. It also didn't help that I wore glasses that were too large for my face, so the plastic frames would sit on my cheekbones causing break-outs around that area. I'd take off my glasses and find oil on the lenses (*sigh).* I ended up barely using the TFS products since I found my skin was far from dry, but they were approaching expiry so I figured I should move on.

&#x200B;

Review:

I did some digging through /r/AsianBeauty and found a lot of recommendations for COSRX as a brand, and more notably their Oil-Free Lotion. I also started doing some research into AHA/BHA skincare and found that my skin met all the symptoms. I've been using the products listed above for 2 months now, and have found a significant improvement. My skin is no longer oily to the touch. I haven't touched my oil blotting papers or my Innisfree no-sebum powder in weeks. I bought new glasses that sit properly on my nose bridge and no longer experience breakouts or oily lenses! I think my favourite product in the line has to be the lotion because my skin just feels like porcelain after I put it on - incredible. I also no longer experience those large painful zits!

&#x200B;

These guys were definitely worth my purchase especially for how affordable they are (I paid $52 USD for the set incl shipping). I would recommend this product line to those who also experience oily skin with the occasional pimple. I WOULD NOT recommend this product to those with sensitive skin, prone to redness or irritation. AHA/BHA can be very irritating and harsh on your skin since you're basically doing a daily mild exfoliation. Do your research before you commit!  


Pros - prevented oily skin, prevented breakouts and large pimples, satisfyingly moisturizing,  affordable, convenient dispenser bottles

Cons - AHA/BHA can be harsh on sensitive skin, some might not like the scents (more herbal-like but I personally love it), can cause some temporary tingling sensations, lotion can be a bit slow to absorb

&#x200B;

TLDR: These products worked well on my oily skin type, but def do your research before going out and purchasing them! Have you tried these before? I'd love to hear about your experiences.  If you have any suggestions for me, I'd love to hear those too!",1564186848.0,0.96,29

Evolving Trends in AB,"As someone who has been doing AB for years, I am always fascinated by the changing trends and products that circulate through here, and wanted to start a discussion about the different trends you’ve seen come and go in AB skincare.

One trend I’ve noticed is shifting ingredients. Circa 2015-16, the really big ingredients I remember were snail, Donkey milk and starfish (briefly). Memebox and their surprise boxes were big. (Edit: also animal/monster print sheetmasks. Remember those??)

During 2016-17, I remember a lot of focus on hanbang/ginseng, propolis, astaxanthin with also gold flakes becoming a gimmicky trend. This was also when words like “glow” and “chok chok” 
skin were used in pretty much every post.

I checked out a bit during 2018, but in 2019 the big “It” ingredients I see everywhere now are urea and centella/madecassoside. 

Another trend I notice popping up seems to be a movement towards more minimalistic routines, whereas a few years ago the trend was basically the longer the routine the better!

What are the product/brand/skincare trends you’ve noticed come in an out of fashion over the years? What gives you nostalgia? What changes have you loved?

Skin type: **Dry, dehydrated, oily/sensitive nose**

&#x200B;

It's very tricky to find the best products that work for my skin and even 3 years later, I still don't know what ingredients work best for my skin except for 2 or 3. With that said, I don't have any specific condition that requires special treatment or attention and I also don't get breakouts easily (last time I got one was last year). My nose, on the other hand, is VERY hard to treat - if I touch it feels like sand and grainy, but at the same time oily and dehydrated  - so, I'm still looking for a specific product that can do it justice.

&#x200B;

My main goal is: **hydration, hydration and hydration!**

&#x200B;

Here we go, I'll try to be as simple and effective as possible.

&#x200B;

*1ST CLEANSER*

**2.5/5.  banila co. Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm (original, purifying and nourishing)** \- honestly, didn't do much, it was hard to apply and it didn't clean as good as an oil cleanser (maybe my skin doesn't like balms?). I won't say it's a bad product, but I won't say it's good either. I used those 3 balms and I didn't feel they were any different in terms of results.

**3.5/5. heimish All Clean Balm** \- yeah, it's a nice balm (and balms don't sit well on my skin apparently), it smells like very good, it's not hard to apply at all, cleans just ok. I think it's a good product for any skin type without being amazing at anything.

**4/5.  THE FACE SHOP Rice Water Bright Cleansing Light Oil** \- glides beautifully, cleans really well, smells SO GOOD (but don't buy this if you're fragrance sensitive or don't like smells). Vitamins, minerals, ceramide... great! The fragrance, not much, without it, it would be 5/5.

**4/5. Neogen Dermalogy Real Cica Micellar Cleansing Oil** \- it's soothing and very good for sensitive skin. It cleanses really well, but I don't think it's enough to get rid of my blackheads. Great option if you want a good cleansing without compromising your skin. It's also hydrating!

**4/5. Cosrx Low pH First Cleansing Milk** \- I never heard of first cleansing milks until I saw this totally randomly. I was surprised how well it glided and cleansed, 0 irritation, 0 problems with this, perfect for sensitive skin, it's a very good product. However, if you want a deeper cleanse, you'll want to switch for something stronger.

&#x200B;

*2ND CLEANSER*

**1/5. THE FACE SHOP Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser**  \- unlike the oil cleanser that I absolutely like, this one is the exact opposite. It gives this squeaky clean feeling without sensing any good ingredient penetrating your skin, but it's also very drying!

**1/5. \[ETUDE HOUSE\] Soon Jung PH 6.5 Whip Cleanser** \- I don't know what's up with people loving this cleanser, it gives me a tacky feeling. I feel clean, yeah, but even using a toner after this is hard. It's definitely not abrassive whatsoever, but there are so many better options.

**2/5. Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Cleansing Foam** \- I bought this when I was still confused about my skin type and condition. I really liked the texture of this cleanser and you could feel the little grains that served for cleansing - because of that, it felt a bit harsh on my skin and I was feeling that squeaky clean feeling from overcleansing. Not for me at all, but it can be quite good for oily skin types.

**2/5. NEOGEN\] Dermalogy Real Fresh Foam (Blueberry)** \- supposedly, it's made for drier skin types, so I bought this after using the green tea one. It was worse, it made my skin drier (irony) and I was feeling a bit down for using this because I loved the green tea cleanser so much.

**2/5. Hada Labo Rohto Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam** \- sorry, I know some of you love this, but it dried my skin a bit. I love how much product you get for the price and that's the biggest win for me.

**3/5. SKINMISO Rice Foaming Cleansing** \- for a foam cleanser, it didn't feel drying and it was quite brightening. It cleansed enough.

**3,5/5.  COSRX Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser** \- good cleanser, good price, does the job. The ingredient list isn't outsanding. Great for summer, not so much for winter as it can be quite drying. Cleans ok and foams just enough. There's one ingredient Doctor Pi mentionned to be quite bad for the skin but I don't recall the name.

**4/5. NEOGEN\] Dermalogy Real Fresh Foam (Green Tea)** \- ahh, yes, love this but at the same time I don't like the fact that it's not hydrating at all (but it's not drying either). Sooo many ingredients in this product and I love its concept. It's definitely one of my favorite products and I wish it could be more hydrating.

**4/5. Hada Labo Tokyo Hydrating Facial Cleanser** \- this is the most hydrating cream-to-foam cleanser I've ever used and it's very hard to come by to something like that. The smell was so great, it cleansed so well and didn't feel too much. Why am I not giving this a 5? I still need a bit more hydration when cleansing and it's a product hard to find if you live in Europe. Overall, very good product.

**4.5/5. KLAIRS Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser** \- my favorite foam cleanser. It's VERY hydrating, so soothing, so soft... its got everything I like in a cleanser and it's not stripping at all. The problem? It's pricey and it's only 100ml in a foam format, so you will quickly use this.

**5/5. LRP Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser** \- the best cleanser for dry skin, ever! The texture, the effectiveness, the quantity of product you get... everything is great with this product. After using this, my face feels soooo soft! It's aesthetically pleasing as well.

&#x200B;

*EXFOLIATORS*

**1/5. Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid** \- I bought this twice, because I was convinced that one bottle wasn't enough to show results. It did NOTHING. I applied it in so much different ways (even using snail's method) but none worked, and I have huge blackheads and pores. At least it maked my skin slighty brighter, but nothing wow.

**1/5. Dr G. Brightening Peeling Gel** \- ugh, this product is a nightmare. It's so hard to use this without getting skin crawl. Just applying this feels awful and I didn't see any results or effectiveness. I was brighter though.

**2/5. BY WISHTREND Mandelic Acid 5% Skin Prep Water** \- skin is definitely smoother when I used this, but it tingled EVERY time. Not a good sign and not a good sensation, I stopped using this after 7 or 8 uses.

**3/5. Cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid** \- so, in the short run, my skin feels so freaking soft when I apply this. On the long run, I don't see any difference, my skin gets back to what it usually is. The smell is awful bad as well and it was very tingly at the beginning.

&#x200B;

*WASH-OFF MASKS*

**0/5. Freeman Skin Face Mask Pack Purifying Cleansing (Avocado)** \- I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this, it's just VERY drying, I don't even see the point of a mask that doesn't even hydrate a little bit.

**1/5. ArtNaturals Dead Sea Mud Mask for Face, Body/Hair - honestly, not great for the face at all, as it's a bit drying. Definitely a good feeling on the body though.**

**1/5. INNISFREE Super Volcanic Peel Off Mask** \- I mean, it doesn't do anything specifically good. It's a gentler option than most peel off masks, but at the same time, if you're not peeling anything, what are you good for?

**1.5/5. \[SKIN&LAB\] Glacial Clay Facial Mask** \- very cooling sensation but it burns my face so much, I couldn't handle this for a long time. It's a great option if you're feeling VERY oily and you need something to cool down quickly.

**2/5. Elizavecca Milky Piggy Carbonated Bubble Clay Mask**  \- this is good for trendy selfies and instagram stories. It feels fresh when applied in the summer and it's a weird tingling sensation but not irritative. Other than that, not exceptionnal, I don't think it makes my skin any better than what normal clays would usually do. It's a fun product, nothing else.

**2/5. SKINFOOD Black Sugar Mask Wash Off** \- ok, a bit of controversy. This smells really great, it's easy to apply and wash off and leaves my skin really soft. BUT, it's also a bit harsh and as I was still uneducated about exfoliators and skin types, I was applying a physical exfoliator religiously on a dry skin. Good job. It's not a bad product, but avoid because it's easy to overexfoliate with it.

**2.5/5. SkinFood ​Black Sugar Honey Mask Wash Off** \- it's betetr than the black sugar mask, but a bit worse than the rice mask one.

**3/5. SKINFOOD Rice Mask Wash Off** \- I liked it better than the Black Sugar one, for being softer and gentler. But, it's still a physical exfoliator and I don't think I benefited my skin that much by rubbing those tiny little particules. It's definitely an improvement to the black sugar anyway.

**3/5. Goodal Wash Up Deep Clean Pore Glacial Clay Wash Off** \- great for summertime and for my oily nose. Normal results, normal product, nothing outstanding.

**3.5/5. I'M FROM Volcanic Mask** \- it's got the best texture out of all the clay masks out there, but I don't think it performs as well. It's kinda creamy and it's very easy to wash off, but it's a very expensive product for what it actually does.

**4/5. Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask** \- honestly, I don't think clay masks do that much to your skin besides a temporary clean and fresh feeling, but the only reason I'm giving a higher review to this one is because of how cheap it is to how much product they give you - and I find it also more effective! It's harder to clean, but you eventually get used to it.

**5/5. I'M FROM Honey Mask** \- this.is.the.goat. The most hydrating, soothing and softening product I've used all those years is right there people. It's on the expensive side, but honestly, there's nothing bad about this! I crave it every day and I wish I was a millionaire to buy a room full of this product only.

&#x200B;

*TONERS*

**0/5. COSRX Two In One Poreless Power Liquid** \- what is even this product, seriously? It just felt like water and nothing else.

**0/5. ETUDE HOUSE Wonder Pore Freshner 10 in 1** \- honestly, a big no for a lot of reasons (drying af being a reason enough). This is the kind of product you start with when you begin a skincare journey and like what you see but don't care what you get.

**1/5. Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera** \- very, very drying. But at least it was a nice post-shave option.

**2.5/5. LANEIGE Cream Skin Refiner** \- ahm, I'm confused with this one. The rave is huge on the internet and everyone swears by this, but honestly, I just felt like applying watery milk on my skin and it didn't even feel moisturizing or hydrating at all, just a bit sticky. It does absorb after a while and it kinda brightens my face, but other than that, it's just a normal product for me.

**3/5. SON&PARK BEAUTY WATER** \- I think it's a good product to clean, exfoliate and tone at the same time, so I wouldn't use this regularly but rather when I feel my skin more congested or in need of some slight exfoliation but not enough to bring a specific exfoliating product. I loved the smell and the packaging. However, it's a bit drying depending on the products you pair it with, so it's very tricky to incorporate this in a stable routine.

**3/5. \[ETUDE HOUSE\] Soon Jung PH 5.5 Relief Toner** \- before saying anything, this is an excellent product for people with sensitive skin or people who need some hydration but don't want to spend tons of money on expensive toners. It's affordable and good, but since I have dry and dehydrated skin, it doesn't compare that well to toners like the KLAIRS one. Of course, ymmv, but I just felt like I was applying water and nothing else.

**3.5/5. Benton Aloe BHA Toner** \- very good for summertime and as an after shave. It's soothing, relaxing, a bit sticky but it compensates with the rest of the benefits. Since I have dry skin, I need something more hydrating.

**4.5/5. KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner** \- my go-to toner when I need to press reset or to wait while a find a new toner. So many hydration comes from this and the ingredient list is fantastic. I don't have a problem with the oils, but there's always the unscented version. I used both and didn't see any differene on my skin besides the smell. Other than that, I just don't give it a 5 because it's an expensive product and it doesn't last that long.

&#x200B;

*ESSENCE/TREATMENTS/VITAMIN C*

**1/5. MISSHA Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence** \- another product that did absolutely nothing. At least the packaging feels luxurious and it lasted for a very long time.

**2/5. KLAIRS Freshly Juiced Vitamin Drop** \- another product that did nothing at all. I only liked how good it is for sensitive skin and I've used it on my nose several times, had no reaction, so I'll at least give a bit of props to the effort put into the formula.

**2/5. MIZON Water volume EX first essence** \- eh, it's nice, doesn't do anything exceptional besides giving some hydration.

**2/5. Rohto Melano CC Anti-Spot Whitening Serum with Vitamins C** \- same thing as the Klairs vitamin c, I don't see anything different (let's just say I don't need any vitamin c apparently).

**2.5/5. PURITO Fermented Complex 94 Boosting Essence** \- I noticed my skin brighter, that's for sure. Other than that, nothing really different, the product is ok, uses up pretty quickly, not innovative.

**3/5. Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence** \- it's not a bad product, at the beginning it was very hydrating and made my skin extremely soft! But, I can't stand the stickiness and it makes my next products apply much harder. I felt a bit disgusting wearing that on my face even though I know it contains really good ingredients.

**4.5/5. ROHTO Hada labo Gokujyun PREMIUM Hyaluronic Acid Super Moist Lotion** \- everyone knows this product, it just resurrects the Jesus out of my skin. I'm not giving it a 5 because it's actually very heavy on the skin and takes some time to penetrate, so when doing my routine I have to wait a bit more time just because of this one product. Other than that, a godsend.

&#x200B;

*AMPOULES/SERUM*

**2/5. MISSHA Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule** \- hmm, yeah, I was expecting more from this. I saw the ingredients list and was amazed, but the results? I didn't see anything. But it still applies very well and leaves my skin a bit more soft.

**4/5. Mizon Original Skin Energy Hyaluronic Acid 100 Ampoule** \- oh wow, so hydrating! This is the stuff my skin needs. I'm just not sure how much benefits it gives to my skin besides hydrating it.

**4/5. Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Serum** \- yeah, loved this stuff. Great hydration for my skin, great ingredients, no particular reactions whatsover. I just find the price a bit high as in any Klairs product.

&#x200B;

*EYE CREAM*

**2/5. Whamisa Organic Flowers Eye Essence** \- the first and last time I bought an expensive product for my eye area. It smells really good and it's very light, but... no results. Don't expect anything from this.

&#x200B;

*MOISTURIZER*

**1/5. Nature Republic Soothing & Moisture Aloe Vera 92% Soothing Gel** \- very drying on the skin after a while, smell is not so great and there are way better aloe vera options out there without alcohol. It's good for sunburns on your body tho.

**2/5. BENTON\] Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel** \- honestly, I don't feel like it's for my skin at all, even in the summer. I didn't feel moisturized enough and even when I was feeling all sweaty and clogging, it just felt like applying a cold gel and that was it. I know the ingredients list is good, it's just didn't provide enough hydration for me.

**2.5/5 Cosrx Oil-Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion** \- ahhh, this product is so weird. It smells nice and it applies easily whenever it's summer or winter. However, it gives a strange greasy feeling to my skin, but it doesn't feel heavy or anything like that. I just feel oilier but no greasier, if that makes sense.

**3/5. Rohto Hada labo SHIROJYUN PREMIUM Whitening milky lotion** \- it's an ok moisturizer, it's definitely light on the skin, easy to apply, feels nice, but I feel like I need more hydration and protection.

**3.5/5. Holika Holika Aloe 97% Soothing Lotion Intensive Moisturizing** \- ""intensive moisturizing"" indeed, but not hydrating enough and doesn't have enough good ingredients to be THE moisturizer I'm looking for. It's a nice, casual option if you want a light moisturizer or after burn spot treatment, you get a lot of product for a good a price and you can also use this in your body.

**4/5. MIZON Black Snail All in one Cream** \- a great and cheap option for all the product you get. Not the best moisturizer out there but you get some good soothing ingredients and it's a good alternative for pricier products that do more or less the same. Don't recommend using this in the summer as you'll feel greasy.

**4/5. Etude House Soon Jung 2X Barrier Intensive Cream** \- I was surprised by the simplicity of the product and how well it functionned. For the price and for the ingredients you get, it's a good product for sure. I was needing a bit more hydration than what it could provide, but at the same time I wasn't feeling bad for applying this and it certainly is a solid choice if you want a safe moisturizer that won't compromise your skin in any kind of situation.

**4/5. Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream** \- lovely moisturizer, so soothing, a bit hydrating, it sits comfortably on the skin. It's got a fantastic ingredient list. If it were cheaper (and I understand why it's not), I would definitely give it a 5.

**4/5. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream** \- instant soothing sensation, amazing texture and smell, god this product is fantastic and it helps so much for my shaving routine and tingling sensation when I get any kind of irritation. But again, it's pricey.

EDIT: I don't know how I forgot this product! **4.5/5. Cerave PM Lotion** \- it's so lightweight, it absorbs really well, it has fantastic ingredients for my skin, it's really safe to use and it lasts for quite some time! I know it's not AB, but it's one damn good product! Could have given 5/5 if it wasn't for the fact that's it a bit hard to find and some websites make it so damn pricier than it usually is.

&#x200B;

*SPF*

**2/5. Klairs Mid-day Blue Lotion** \- I hated the white cast on this so much. It's also not hydrating or comfortable to wear. I just give it a 2 because of the nice ingredients list.

**3/5. Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen Hyaluronic Acid** \- amazing protection, the products smells nice but it's also a bit drying if I don't use hydrating products before, so beware of that.

**3.5/5. MISSHA\] All Around Safe Block Waterproof Sun Milk** \- I really liked this, glided so well, protected so much and it's an affordable product. I love the consistency and the easiness to apply it, great sunscreen option!

**3.5/5. ROHTO Skin Aqua Super Moisture Milk -** I would say it compares to the previous one.

**4.5/5. MISSHA All-around Safe Block Essence Sun** \- hmm, essence spf, what a great invention! This is a must for winter times when you want that extra moisture. It's not sticky all (unless you use this in the summer) and it's cheap for how well it performs.

&#x200B;

*SLEEPING PACKS*

**1.5/5. Laneige Water Sleeping Mask** \- oof, the fragrance is so heavy on this one. It doesn't absorb that much and it feels very heavy on my skin. It's got some hydrating properties, but I don't think it's worth using this just because of the ridiculous amount of smell emaning from it.

**2/5. Etude House Moistfull Collagen Sleeping Pack** \- I liked how hydrating it is at the beginning but the next morning I don't feel my skin as plump as when I'm using other sleeping packs. It also contains alcohol and fragrance, big no no. I don't give it a 1 because my skin didn't suffer anything from it and it's still a good cream for other body parts.

**3.5/5 \[LANEIGE\] Lip Sleeping Mask** \- I love the strawberry smell and how much product you get for the price (it lasts a really long time trust me). It really hydrates and my lips feel very soft, however, it's easy to apply too much and it becomes quite greasy and heavy after a while.

**3.5/5. Klairs Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask** \- very good ingredient list, my skin was brighter and definitely more moisturized. Why this rating? It's very expensive for what it does, it's very hard to apply and it can be messy sometimes. I like how innovative the texture is but the overall result was good but not amazing (it dried my skin for a period but it went away).

**3.5/5. Cosrx Ultimate Nourishing Rice Overnight Spa Mask** \- hmm, it's good, I wake up brighter and smoother for sure. There's something weird with this product though. Some days it feels amazing on the skin but some days it just feels like it's drying but not quite, idk. I'm not sure about the smell either, it smells like rice but I can definitely smell some other chemicals that are a bit discomforting. But yeah, does the job.

&#x200B;

*SPOT TREATMENTS*

**5/5. Cosrx Centella Blemish Cream** \- I use this when I get pimples or some kind of inflammation. It's rare to happen, but when it does, I just put a bit of the product on those concerned areas and in the next 2/3 days they are GONE, it's no joke! Very good ingredient list, very good price, huge amount of product and it's effective.

**5/5. Cosrx Acne Pimple Master Patch** \- nothing to say about this, it's cheap af and effective af. I like to apply a patch on a pimple after cleansing and before toning, leaving it all night (or during the day, I just use a concealer or something on top of it).

&#x200B;

*OILS*

**4.5/5. Acure The Essentials Marula Oil** \- the only oil I've used until now and I'm loving it. I pair this with a heavy moisturizer at night when I feel I need more hydration and protection, but I also pair it with a light-medium moisturizer if I want the same feeling but don't want to risk feeling congestionned (if it's summer for example).

&#x200B;

I may be forgetting some products since I couldn't keep track of everything I bought, but those are the most importants at least.

Also, you may have seen I've used a lot of wash-off masks compared to the number of products I used for moisturizers or toners. It just means that I repurchased some products 2 or 3 times and most of my wash-off masks were given to some friends :) I also stopped using them on my whole face and restricted it only to my nose.

&#x200B;

So for now, my **TOP 5** produts are:

1. I'M FROM Honey Mask
2. LRP Toleriane Hydrating Gentle Facial Cleanser
3. ROHTO Hada labo Gokujyun PREMIUM Hyaluronic Acid Super Moist Lotion
4. KLAIRS Supple Preparation Facial Toner
5. MISSHA All-around Safe Block Essence Sun (or Cerave PM Lotion, I have to include this in my ranking somewhere)

My favorite Korean Sunscreens! AKA looking for a replacement for Biore Aqua Rich Water Essence?,"I've been living in Seoul for the last 2 months and have really enjoyed checking out all the sunscreen options. I found a few that aren't mentioned much on this sub. One stellar find has been the **Innisfree Aqua Water Drop SPF 50+ PA++++**. It's more or less the same as the original Biore Aqua Rich Water Essence - there are no alcohols AND no silicones!!

&#x200B;

Its a chemical sunscreen, so absolutely no white cast. It comes out kinda a creamy gel and finishes really nicely - almost  dewy. I have combo skin and am a MAC NW18, so I usually skip the moisturizer step in the morning, put this sunscreen on, then put the Innisfree No Sebum Mineral Powder on my T-zone and am good to go for the day.  I really love this sunscreen and find it reasonably priced. Its 18,000 KRW (\~$16) for 50ml. It is not waterproof and is removable with just water)

Oh and right now Innisfree is doing a BOGO promotion on all their sunscreens, so.....I might have bought a TON of sunscreen there. I also picked up the **Innisfree Intensive Leisure Sunscreen stick** (18,000 KRW for 19g) which I use to reapply during the day, it mostly doesn't mess up make up and honestly is the only thing that is helping me keep to the reapply every 2-3 hours. It goes on really smoothly, almost feels like NOTHING, and nicely gives me a matte look on my face if I happen to have gotten a bit shiny during the day. This one is waterproof and I need to use a oil/balm cleanser to remove. Lastly, as I normally live in Colorado where the winters are dry and harsh (well when I'm skiing) , I also picked up the **Moist Winter Barrier UV Protection Cream** (12,000 KRW for 35ml). This is very similar to the Aqua Water Drop, but is much richer and creamier - feels really good when I tried it on my hand. I believe I've seen this mentioned positively by Director Pi. 

&#x200B;

Other 2 sunscreens I liked a lot were the Etude House UV Double Cut Fresh Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++ and the Missha Allround Safe Block Essence SPF45 PA+++, but think the Innisfree Aqua Water Drop is superior.

[Discussion] Regarding face massage tools,"Does anyone do face massages with a ""kassa plate""? Or ""gua sha"" in chinese. I don't know what it's called in english.

I got one recently as part of a present campaign by a skincare item, it says use with oil or cream. When I got it I just used an emulsion I'm trying to get rid off to try it out. Now I want to do it for real on a regular basis and there aren't many clear cut instructions on the internet.

So to those who use this, do you do this during your night time skincare? Like after your last step of skincare or something (I'm paranoid it'll just scrape off the cream you just put on your skin)? Or do you do it at a separate time with an oil/cream you specially buy to do this? I tried using my normal skincare but my serum is the sticky kind/skincare absorbs, not sit on the face as smooth lube for the kassa plate.",1563978338.0,0.91,4

Review: Laniege Cream Skin,"**Product**: [Laniege Cream Skin](https://us.laneige.com/cream-skin-toner-moisturizer)

**Claim**: Toner and moisturizer in one

**My skin**: Super oily, some issues with pores

**Routine**: At night, after cleansing and essence/acids, I put a small puddle of LCS in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together, then rub the stuff all over my face. This is a toner and moisturizer, and I've been cutting down products in my routine, so this has become the full night time routine. 

**Review**: 

This is a *fantastic* moisturizer for oily skin. I was a bit nervous about using it, so I bought the deluxe sample size from YesStyle, and now I'm convinced that this is the moisturizer I've been looking for all my life. I'd previously been using Belif's Aqua Bomb, and while it worked well with my oils, it and other gel moisturizers sank into my skin quickly, but didn't leave me feeling necessarily as if I was well hydrated. Not the case with LCS--much like the difference between a regular chapstick and the Lip Sleeping Mask by Laneige, this moisturizer is something that I can actually feel results from in the morning.

LCS comes out of the bottle like a slightly thick liquid--not quite water but almost. I didn't think I'd like applying it with my hands, but that's actually one of the things I love so much now. After rubbing it on my face and neck, I rub whatever's left into my hands like a hand lotion and my hands are *noticeably* softer. It's kind of weird how I'm noticing how I don't need hand lotion and how remarkably soft my hands are throughout the day. I don't touch my face all the time, lol, but if it's working on my hands...

For someone with dry skin, ymmv, but for me, the claim of toner/moisturizer in one works well. I like the abbreviated steps and definitely don't need any more moisturizer. 

**Pros:**

* Works very well with oily skin
* Simple application
* Reduces steps as it's toner/moisturizer in one
* Feels and smells ""clean"" (there's not really a scent, but that also means there's not really a ""product"" scent, such as in SK-II)
* Really makes my skin feel nice with an ideal level of moisture
* Despite the amount of product I use, I seem to be going through the bottle slowly. Compare this to the same size of SK-II deluxe sample I bought which is nearly empty and I'm not even half through the LCS--despite using it the same amount of time.

**Cons:**

* Does have a ""sticky"" residue, a slightly tacky feel that doesn't go away for awhile. 
* Because of the tacky issue, I'm only using it at night, not as a part of the morning routine. This isn't really a con for me, as I use sunscreen as my morning moisturizer, but may be an issue for some.

I went a little wild for my first order from YesStyle, but this is the only product I feel is worthy of a review, so take that as you will.",1563969229.0,0.96,34
Stuff I bought in Japan & Korea + First Impressions,"I stayed in Japan for 2.5 weeks and Korea for the remaining half week. I'm actually impressed that I didn't buy as much as I thought I was going to, but here's what I got.

For reference, I have combination skin where my t-zone gets slightly oily and the rest of my skin is between normal and dry.


**[Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence](https://www.amazon.ca/Biore-Aqua-Watery-Essence-SPF50/dp/B01MTDFFQ5)**
The sunscreen I brought for the trip (Etude House Watery Light) was running low so I got this one. The texture is really light and the finish is non-sticky, but I feel like the alcohol is a little too drying for me. You can really smell the alcohol. Within the humidity of Japanese summer, this didn't feel too dry, but I can tell it wouldn't work for Canadian winter. Ended up giving it to my mom.

**[Skin Aqua Tone Up UV Essence](https://www.amazon.com/Rohto-Sunscreen-Essence-SPF50-Green/dp/B07BKWLCWH)**
My current sunscreen. The texture is definitely thicker than the Biore, but it still feels pleasant on my skin. The ""tone up"" effect is barely there; however, that may just be because I'm already pretty pale (I'm around NW20). I'm not really into the tone up thing so that's fine with me. Not a huge on the scent, but it hasn't caused any actual issues for my skin so far.

**[Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Gel](https://www.amazon.com/Shiseido-Anessa-Perfect-Sunscreen-SPF50/dp/B0792KWN6F)**
I bought this because of all the commercials I watched on the trains. Also probably the most I've ever spent on sunscreen. The texture and finish are really nice. On my skin, it almost feels like it's just moisturizer. Really excited to switch to this one after I use up the Skin Aqua.

**[Kikumasamune High Moisture Skin Lotion](https://www.amazon.com/Kikumasamune-Sake-Skin-Lotion-Moisture/dp/B00ECQCVK0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8SDMQN48R85Q&keywords=kikumasamune+high+moist+lotion&qid=1563952729&s=beauty&sprefix=kiku%2Cbeauty%2C202&sr=1-1)**
The decision to buy this was highly influenced by this subreddit. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for my skin. I'm not sure if it's the fermentation or the fragrance, but the acne I got when I started using this immediately cleared when I stopped. I currently share this with my sister, using it for my body instead.

**[Hadalabo Gokujun Oil Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/ROHTO-Hadalabo-Gokujun-Cleansing-200ml/dp/B07GGV7VFM/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1K4FOXQC1GYUE&keywords=hada+labo+cleansing+oil&qid=1563953040&s=beauty&sprefix=hada%2Cbeauty%2C203&sr=1-3)**
In terms of oil cleansing, I've only really used straight-up olive oil and this cleanser sure is way nicer than that. It removes makeup and emulsifies easily; however, I would still recommend following up with another cleanser.

**[Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion Moist](https://www.amazon.ca/Rohto-Hadalabo-Gokujun-Hyaluronic-Lotion/dp/B00BSNBO9O)**
An impulse buy. I actually really enjoy this toner though. It's more viscous than I'm used to, but it also still absorbs fine and doesn't feel sticky. My skin definitely feels more hydrated after using this. I personally like using it right after I get out of the shower.

**[Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Cream](https://www.amazon.com/Hada-Labo-Rohto-Goku-Jun-Hyaluronic/dp/B00BS3Q372/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=hada+labo+cream&qid=1563953854&s=beauty&sr=1-4)**
My other impulse purchase. This reminds me of the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, but thicker. Still a really pleasant texture, although I'm not sure if this will be moisturizing enough in winter.

**[Canmake Stay-On Balm Rouge](https://www.canmake.com/en/item/detail/)**
I got this in shade 15 (Elegant Dhalia), which is a ruby red color in the tube. For a lip balm, it's pretty pigmented. It gives my lips a natural-looking flush. I use this as my daily lip colour. I also like that it contains some UV protection. The texture is on the waxier side.

**[Canmake Perfect Stylist Eyes](https://www.canmake.com/en/item/detail/19)**
I got this in #11 (Rose Beige). I won't say these shadows are super pigmented, but the colour definitely shows. At the very least, this is much more pigmented than Korean shadows tend to be. The powder is really smooth and easy to blend and the shimmer is also really pretty. I use this for daily eye shadow.

**[UZU Eye Opening Liner](https://www.uz.team/ph/eyeopeningliner/openingliner.html)**
Although I was tempted to get the light blue and pink, I only bought this in black. At @cosme this was ranked #1 in the eyeliner category so I was curious since I never heard of this before. This ended up being the best liquid liner I've tried. The brush tip allows for my shaky hands to draw my liner in one stroke, it doesn't smudge at all, and it's easy to remove. My only complaint is that the ends of the line eventually fade. Even in humid Tokyo this liner managed to mostly survive.

**[Peripera Ink Corrector](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/peripera-ink-corrector-4-colors-04-flaw-tuning-lemon/info.html/pid.1059761565)**
I got this in #01 (Dark Theif Peach). The texture is on the lighter side and it blends easily. It actually does a lot to reduce my panda eyes.

**[3CE Red Recipe Matte Lip Colour](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/3-concept-eyes-red-recipe-matte-lip-color-3-colors/info.html/pid.1060962588)**
I got this in #215 (Ruby Tuesday). I've bought 3CE matte lipsticks before and this one is probably my favourite. The colour is a really pretty dark, cool-toned red. Both gradation and full lips look really good. The formula is definitely on the dry side though. I highly recommend using lip balm before applying this lipstick.

**[Etude House Soft Drink Tint](https://www.yesstyle.com/en/etude-house-soft-drink-tint-5-colors-pp501-grape/info.html/pid.1067332128)**
I got this in #RD301 (Zero Red). For some reason, I only bought red lip colours during this trip. This has a watery gel-like texture. The staying power is pretty average. As long as you don't eat anything it'll stay on. It also smells like cola which is pretty fun.


And that's the end. I'll be sure to add swatches later when I have some decent lighting. :)

What are some ways you would suggest to learn how to use makeup (e.g. specific Youtube channels, etc.)? What are some essential products that you have to get when starting to wear makeup?

Side note: When did you start wearing makeup and is there an age to start wearing makeup?

[review] first sheet mask experience,"Despite being into AB for several years, I'd never tried something that is super popular with AB skincare enthusiasts - sheet masks.

First off, I've never bought them because I find the idea of single-use skincare products wasteful. But I got one as a freebie with something I ordered, so I figured I'd give it a go.

(Labiotte real nature sheet mask green tea)

First, I take it out of the package, gently unfold it and start sticking it to my face. My first thought was ""eww...this feels...slimy"". But still, I stuck it onto my face, smoothed it out to sit as well as it could, and watched about 20 minutes of Grey's Anatomy while the mask did its thing.

Removed it, applied the excess to my neck and body. Sitting here writing this my face feels slightly sticky.

And checking in later that night and the next morning, it didn't do anything for my skin beyond what a hydrating product from a bottle could've done

Final verdict? As expected, I do not like sheet masks. From first application I find the sensation on my face unpleasant, and I didn't like the feeling of it sitting on my face. I have no problems with wash-off masks, so it isn't simply the feeling of something sitting on my skin, but the feeling of a thin damp sheet on my face. Aside from that, it's not worth the hassle - it's more effective to have a product that you apply to your skin (an essence, lotion, etc) and leave there all day vs something that sits on your face for 15 minutes on a damp sheet and then leaves some essence on your face. I really really don't get the appeal.

And honestly, even if I did enjoy the sheet mask experience I still wouldn't buy them. I'd rather buy a whole bottle of essence/serum/toner etc that can do good for my skin on many occasions than have a single-use product that I only benefit from once and then throw out the product and the packaging.

Sheet masks get a solid thumbs down from me.",1563548784.0,0.71,23

"[Discussion] HG Cushion Foundations, Primers, Volumizers and Makeup Fixers?","Hey guys! I want to talk about my favorite type of makeup, complexion! 

I believe Korean Cushions are the best foundations have every tried because a lot of them have given me a super natural look, like my skin but better. I also love how dewy the primers are and I find Volumizers so fun. 

Here are some of my favorite products: 

Moonshot Micro Setting Fit Cushion - I thought I wouldn't like this because I normally like the dewy look, but this cushion has become my HG for summer.  It literally makes me look like I have no makeup on, and it lasts all day. I find the coverage buildable and I just love how it looks like skin on me. Coloring wise, I thought 201 would be too orange on me, but it actually is a bit too fair for me and I might be purchasing 301. 

Pony Effect cushion - Another one of my faves, It makes my skin look so dewy. The shade I got is a bit pale. (I am NW/NC (Yes I have to mix them) 15)  But I love this one. 


Primers : 

I like the dewy look as I mentioned.. however I have only tried two primers. 

VDL Lumilayer Primer - Really like this product, probably won't repurchase. 

Heimeish Artless Glow Base - Not as glowy as I like, but It is a good sunscreen. I use it for when I am not spending a lot of time outdoors. 

Non AB - but I really like Farasali Glass Glow Drops and Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter as well. 

Volumizer 
Etude House Nymph Glow Aura - Only one I tried, it is good. I find it to be a great dupe for a non AB product, the Kevyn Aucoin Glass Glow Face highlighter. 


Here are some products I want to try that I have on my wishlist on Jolse : 

Cushions: 

moonshot Face Perfection Balm Cushion

CLIO Kill Cover Ampoule Cushion

CLIO Kill Cover Founwear Cushion


Moonflash cushion-  Moonshot

Moonshot Micro Correctfit Cushion

Primer : 

Mamonde Aqua Glow Ball Base 50ml

"[Journal] A bout of cystic acne, and how daily consistency saved my skin","While I was on birth control, nothing, and I repeat, nothing, could make my skin break out. Not the products that made me feel really crappy while it was on my skin. Not a big bag of spicy chips (Chile Limon potato chips, to be specific). Not consumption of a whole jar of kimchi in one day. Not looming ""period"" that wasn't, you know, real period, because I was on birth control after all.

I had been off of birth control for 7 months when the most horrible breakout happened: 3 acne cysts, 1 on the left cheek and 2 on the right cheek. It happened maybe after I ate a whole jar of kimchi in a day (don't judge kimchi is goodness damn it). And overnight, there they were.

During the 7 months between stopping birth control and the 3 acne cysts, my skin didn't get crappy overnight. Just like how birth control helped my skin over time, so did stopping it. The first two months were barely noticeable. Minimal break out close to period, but nothing major. And then the really obvious hormonal acne started to come like clockwork the week before my period - always on my chin. But they weren't *horrible*. They were treatable with the usual benzoyl peroxide and high strength salicylic acid. And it was only the week before my period that I started putting acid on my skin like crazy - salicylic, lactic, at the same time, whatever I had on hand. Then my skin would be flaky, but it would still be no big deal. During these 7 months, I had reverted back to all the old products that I was sure did not make me break out - HABA and The Ordinary. But just reverting back to old products and putting acids on my skin a week per month wasn't enough.

I realized it when the 3 acne cysts all popped up. In a way, they saved my skin.

That's when I realize how terribly clogged my skin was, because I was off birth control. It didn't all of a sudden become ""sensitive"" to new products. It was the oil production causing sebum clogging up my skin that led to these horrible cysts. They probably were looming for a while before I noticed them. So I sat down and thought about how to declog these pores. And I made a resolution to do these 3 things every. single. day.

\- **Oil cleansing**: I couldn't find any literature on how oil cleansers help acne, but anecdotal reports from many people, including those on this subreddit, reassured me enough to try it. I bought a Shu Uemura Ultim8 sublime a while back, but only used it whenever I wore make up that I deemed heavy enough to need an oil cleanser. It was really pleasant to use, but I was just lazy. I now do it every day before putting on night time skin care, without fail. And sure enough, my skin feels so much cleaner without being irritated. Some of the blackheads even loosen over time and fall off with the cleanser!

\- **Exfoliating**: every other day and the week before my period - every day, after oil cleansing with the Shu Uemura, I follow up with the AmorePacific Treatment Enzyme Peel. I've also had this for a long time,  but kind of brushed it aside thinking it was overpriced ineffectiveness when I was only using it twice a week. Now that I use it at least every other day, suddenly my skin seems so much brighter. The exfoliation is gentle and, after getting used to the scent, satisfying. It never dries out my skin.

\- **Salicylic acid**: I know technically this can also fall under exfoliating, but I wanted to give it its own paragraph. I use Paula's 2% BHA, but other 2% BHA products probably would work the same. I actually bought this after the 3 acne cysts popped up, realizing how terribly I needed a daily BHA (I already had her 8% spot treatment, but even that is not enough any more when you have more than 3 pimples all at once...) I now use it twice a day, every day, and it is the product that I remember to use without fail.

I've been doing - if on some day, nothing else - these 3 things consistently, and a period has passed without any pimple popping up on my face. On my jawline, where I don't always apply skin care there as well as my face because I honestly just don't care as much, there are (quite) a few pimples popping up around my period, which means I didn't miraculously have a ""good month"" when my hormones weren't acting out. I didn't have any pimple on my face, because I was diligent, every day, about my skin care.

The 3 acne cysts each took 2 months to go away. Honestly, once they're there, there's nothing short of a cortisone shot that can make them disappear (other than time). But really, they're probably what I needed to tell me to stop being lazy. For some people with good skin (or myself while on birth control), just washing face and putting on the cheapest random drugstore moisturizer would be sufficient to have acne free skin. And then for the rest of us, we just can't.

There's no magic cure for acne. But you may just be able to achieve it, if you take care of your skin every single day. It took me 3 cysts to be reminded of this. I hope it doesn't take you the same amount of pain (ugh).",1563468836.0,0.98,14

"Houston people! Let's compare notes about the local AB stores, and how do you decide between a relationship with the store, or the lower prices on ebay?","**Ichimaru** has changed up their display again. I've seen one of the Nakeup face cushions, they have the Allie UV sunscreen for 29.99 (about the same as Amazon, but ebay is cheaper). They have some Hada Labo a few dollars more than Amazon prices, an eyelash serum the same marked up price that I've seen on ebay and Amazon.. they have a few kbeauty items.

*Deals:* After you get 10 points, $20 spend before tax = 1 point, there is a 10% off your next purchase. It seems like there is some kind of membership?

Evidently they have a birthday deal that you get. They seem to have semifrequent posted deals/sales.

&#x200B;

**Japan House** near Seiwa seems to be cheaper generally, with some exceptions than Ichimaru and the selection is different, but a small chuck is the same.

&#x200B;

**Blooming Cosmetics** is... kind of expensive. I feel like the employee that I go to will give me honest opinions and not just try to sell me things. But, these sheet masks that she recommended that I ended up really liking are $28 for 10, Ichimaru has some other ones of that brand on sale $40 for 20 and ebay has it \~$14 for 10. I think the Neogen cleansing pads are $27 or $24 I can't remember. Innisfree items are cheaper elsewhere. The Etude House cat ear hair band is a good price, some of their tools are priced well. Some of the high end kits are sold in sets and the prices aren't too bad I think..

Sometimes they get newly released in Korea items-- they got the Laneige Layering cushion fairly early?

I feel like some of their items are fresh, since they get them straight from Korea. If I had to choose between here and Sephora for Laneige, and other items that are the same price at Sephora.. even though I could get that discount at Sephora, I think I'd rather get the Korean version here... Laneige in Korea is a little bit different than the US version.

The owner remembers me, and she is nice to me. I think that the owner and one of the employees of everyone there will help me find something without just trying to get me to buy something so I appreciate their advice especially since I feel like I haven't figured out how to find the type of advice on here that ends up working for my skin. I get lots of samples. I like O Hui and Phyto vital. They gave me lots of History of Wu spot treatment because I was paranoid about a few spots even though they looked at me like, what spots? You don't need this... But they can be expensive. I'm struggling between continuing to go here and going to ebay. How can I use my loyalty to get lower prices? The owner gave me a discount once on a last-one hair tie.

*Deals*: After you spend $300 you get $10 back.

Sometimes when things go on sale, it can be a good price. They had an O Hui cushion buy one get one free (that's 6 packs total for \~$50? can't remember).

&#x200B;

**Hallyu Cosmetics**: Their prices don't seem too bad. They have smaller brands than Blooming (so it seems to me- the Blooming owner never heard of Goodal when I mentioned the brand).

I think if you just had surgery on some sort of bone in your face, they can understand (or at least that one girl that one time) that you just had surgery whether or not that was just dental, medically necessary, or cosmetic, they have a good facemask for you. I went looking for eyeliner one day and the advice I got felt like it was coming from a teen who just liked good makeup/skincare and is thinking of something that can do what you're looking for, like a Starbucks barista figuring out how to custom your drink for you when you don't know a clue to what you're doing.

*Deals*: they seem to have regular sales

&#x200B;

**Aritaum** **(inside H Mart)** feels like Sephora, but they haven't really caught on with new products.

They have the favorite ginger sugar scrub for.. was it the same price as Yesstyle? Or a dollar or two more? Plus you don't need to find $35 to get free shipping or wait a month+ for it...

*Deals*: their membership feels like Sephora's

Sometimes they have sales and promotions

\--------------------

I feel like if I am going to try to develop a relationship with someone, it's easier to find one person and stick to them. Does anyone here frequently visit any store? How do you successfully gain a good relationship with a salesperson?

&#x200B;

\--------------------

Edit:

**Great Wall** I just checked out the grocery store by Blooming and Ichimaru in Dun Huan Plaza, they have My Beauty Diary masks 8 for $10, and the Honey Propolis masks are $16 instead of.. $28 and $20 at those cosmetics stores. [photo of great wall selection](https://imgur.com/a/96hbyQM)

"[Review] A Review After 6 Months of My Current Skincare Routine (Heimish, Benton, Bellalussi, COSRX, Etude House, The Face Shop)","After 6 months of testing out these products, I wanted to give a review of my experience with my current skin care routine. I have normal skin that can have isolated areas of dryness and minimal CC type acne. 

**Oil Cleanser**: Heimish All Clean Balm - This may be one of my HG products. This oil-based cleanser is so through at removing any trace of makeup on my face, even waterproof mascara. It comes with a cute little spatula for scooping out the balm. It never feels like my face has been stripped after washing it off, my skin always feels hydrated and clean.

**Water Based Cleanser**: Benton Honest Cleansing Foam – After using this, I probably won’t buy another foaming cleanser. Even though the product claims to be a non-tightening formula, my skin always feels stretched after washing off this cleanser.  It also has a pretty heavy fragrance, so it may be irritating on sensitive skin. However, this cleanser does create a very rich foam that feels very nice going on to your skin. 

**Toner**: Etude House Wonder Pore Freshner – I have always had pretty large pores between my eyebrows and on the sides of my nose. I have noticed a visible reduction in my pore size since I have started using this toner. It does feel like a very mild toner (I have used some US made toners that have broken me out before) however it feels very hydrating on my skin. I will usually swipe this toner on to my skin with Pyunkang Yul Cotton Pads and then use the cotton pad as a mini sheet mask on areas where I have larger pores.  

**Sheet Masks**: I have honestly been so all over the place with sheet masks, I don’t even know if I’ve purchased one more than once. I even tried a sheet mask subscription service. I’m still on the hunt for a mask that I want to use consistently. I am looking for one that is moisturizing and works to erase and prevent fine lines and wrinkles. 

**Eyecream**: Bellalussi Ultra Repair Snail Peptide Cream – I just loveee snail products, bring on the muscin. I found this eye cream on Amazon out of desperation after that Mizon eye cream sample I was using ran out. I have to say; I am happy with it. It doesn’t sit on top of my skin or feel sticky. I only have to use the lightest layer for each eye, and it absorbs and really feels like it is working. It does claim to reduce dark circles, but I, for one, haven’t noticed that effect. It also comes in a huge tube as far as eye products go. I feel like I may have trouble using it all up before it expires. 

**Essence**: COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence – If I had to pick one AB product that I couldn’t live without, it would be this one. My skin tends to get very dry and flaky during early spring, I don’t know if it is caused by temperature change or seasonal allergies or what. But I get so self-conscious about my face and I can’t wear makeup over the flaky areas, it just don’t work ya’ll. I found this essence right around the time my skin starts to rebel, I already had some flaky-ness going on when I first started using it. I have had zero problems with dryness since then, my skin always soaks this essence up very quickly and feels bouncy and hydrated. On rare days when I am lazy and abbreviate my routine, this still goes on my face. 

**Mostiurizure**: The Face Shot Mango Seed Silk Moisturizing Lotion – I have to admit; I am pretty meh on this one. The scent is not very mango-y which is disappointing to me because I love mango. The formula is decently creamy but also feels watery if that makes sense… Especially after using the COSRX Power Essence, I feel like I can skip this step most days. I would like to find a different moisturizer that is a little thicker in texture and doesn’t have a fragrance.

**Mask**: I am consistently using the COSRX Nourishing Rice Overnight Mask as the last step in my PM routine. This mask does a great job at sealing in all the products in my routine. My skin always feels silky smooth in the morning when I wash it off. It does have a little bit of a sticky texture when it dries down, so if that kind of thing bothers you, you may not like it. 

I hope you guys enjoyed this review of the products that I have been using for my routine. If you’ve used any of them as well, I would love to hear about your personal experiences.",1563147565.0,0.95,1

[Review] of sorts: Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil for removing grease (read: sunscreen) stains from clothes,"I wear a long-sleeved UPF shirt on a daily basis in the summer, and unfortunately the light-colored polyester fabric really loves to soak up the sunscreen on my neck and hands over time. This leaves dark stains as if the clothing is slightly wet, and the stains barely fade when washed normally with laundry detergent or even when scrubbed with Dawn dish soap.

Fortunately, I've found that cleansing oil (I use Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil, as mentioned in the title) makes short work of these stains, with no scrubbing required. Just saturate the stain with the cleansing oil, and wash as normal with the rest of your laundry. This does require a good amount of oil, since the fabric will actively absorb it, so I would definitely recommend using a cheap cleansing oil (the Softymo is the cheapest per mL that I've found) or one that didn't work out for your face.

This trick seems to work on any kind of oil-based stain, including older ones -- I struggled with the sunscreen stains on my UPF shirt for months before trying the cleansing oil! It also works wonderfully on non-polyester fabrics, including my cotton or cotton+poly shirts and pants. So far I can confirm the effectiveness of Softymo on stains from the following:

* Nivea Strong Fit UV Milky Gel (this has been my daily sunscreen since its release; if there's interest in a separate review I'm happy to write one)
* Anessa Perfect UV Sunscreen Skincare Milk
* Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk
* Food grease (sizzling K-BBQ is very tasty but also very messy!)

Anyway, I feel like this was a pretty silly ""review"" to write, but hopefully it helps someone. :)

NB: This post is *not* about the yellow/orange stains left by avobenzone on clothes washed in hard water. While my area does have hard water, I avoid avobenzone sunscreens for exactly that reason and have yet to see any orange staining. Though I suppose it wouldn't hurt to try cleansing oil on those...",1563038445.0,0.98,13
SKIPCARE but I stopped using moisturizer?,"I used to use the Nature Republic Aqua moisturizer for combination skin (the green one) and it did the job pretty well, it did moisturize my skin without the excess grease. But for some reason since I started using it, my skin became bumpy and textured. I use the cetaphil gentle cleanser (used since I was 13) with it and my trusty Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner, so it could only mean that it's the one causing my skin to get bumpy. I stopped using it for about 5 days now and my skin became smoother. I ran out of the gentle skin cleanser so I use a foam cleanser now but still use the Pyunkang Yul toner. I use the It's Skin Power Effector VC(?), the yellow one at night after my toner and my routine is done. I don't feel dry, and I haven't had any adverse reaction yet. I know that moisturizer is essential but **is the Pyunkang Yul toner enough for hydrating my skin?** I don't feel like using the moisturizer again or try any new products for fear of breaking out or getting bumpy skin.

P.S. I exfoliate in the morning using the Nivea Baby cream or something like that by massaging it for a minute on my face and then wiping it with a wet towel. I wash with clean water then leave it like that the rest of the day and i never felt dry or greasy - my skin feels comfortable. I don't wash my skin with cleanser in the morning.

Doing skin care for a long time, I feel like I may be doing something wrong by not sticking to the 'essentials,' but I want to scrape off my preconceived notions and believe in my routine since it's working well for me. **I want to know if any of you tried this sort of 'breaking the rules' routine and how it worked for you.**",1563035005.0,0.5,3

[Guide] Hwahae TOP 100 Korean Sunscreen List + Ingredient Analysis/Awareness,"**Hwahae:** It's a review/ranking app for Koreans for beauty-related things. This list is for people who can't read Korean/don't use the app.

***SORRY THIS TOOK SO LONG. It took much longer than other lists because of all the info I had to gather. That and me rage quitting for a while after computer decided to delete all the ingredient lists I typed out.  :I***

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**General Info (That I got questions about):**

*The reason I typed out some of the ingredient lists is bc I can't find the list in English online that I can easily copy and paste, or the ingredients aren't up to date.*

*I bolded some ingredients that are helpful for skin/skin-identical for healthy skin barrier.*

*The dollar cost is the converted retail price of what it would cost in Korea, without sale/promo.*

*I also looked up all the common plant names from their scientific names because it annoys me when I look at ingredients and I have no idea what that plant is..*

***PEG -*** *something* *means something has been altered or made to be water soluble. It is useful for that but some people avoid it due to microplastics (I don't know a whole lot about it, but have heard people say this).*

[***You don't need to be SUPER DUPER concerned about visible light/blue light protection***](https://labmuffin.com/blue-light-computers-phones-damage-skin/) ***and whatnot, even though some of these products claim to protect against them.***

***TINTED sunscreens are lightly tinted usually in beige or peach color. Peachy shades cancel dark/brown-ish tones (like dark spots, dark undereyes), making skin appear brighter/more awake than normal.***

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FOR SENSITIVE SKINNED FOLKS ONLY:**

*There is* ***fragrance*** *in the form of natural* ***essential oils*** *and synthetic oils in some of these products. Contrary to popular belief,* **synthetic** ***fragrance*** *isn't worse than essential oils as they can be modified to have less skin-sensitizing components.*

*While fragrance can be* ***perfectly fine*** *for some if you have* ***healthy skin*** *and don't mind the actual smell,* **VERY** ***sensitive*** *skin types may want to* ***avoid it*** *as we don't know exactly what it's made up of. There's another camp that says* ***long term exposure*** *fragrance/essential oils on healthy skin can make it more likely for your skin to* ***develop*** *problems/sensitivity later on. As always,* ***YMMV.***

*Many of these companies* ***claim*** *that their product is the* ***gentlest*** *for the most sensitive skin because of EWG (Environmental Working Group) rating of 1, but* ***EWG is NOT a reliable source, especially for sensitive skinned folks***\*\*, *as they can be very biased and promote skin-sensitizing things just because an ingredient sounds more ""natural"".\** ***Natural*** *things usually contain much more possible* ***skin triggers*** *than lab-isolated,* ***single*** *ingredients.*

&#x200B;

***Potentially Irritating Filters (From Lab Muffin Beauty Science Blog)***

>**Avobenzone** is a common irritant and allergen, so it tends to be unsuitable for sensitive skin, and you’re left with inorganic sunscreens only.  
>  
>If you’re elsewhere in the world, the newer UVA1 filters aren’t particularly irritating or allergenic.  
>  
>A few other organic sunscreens also tend to cause allergic and irritant reactions: **octocrylene, oxybenzone, avobenzone, PABA, Padimate O and enzacamene.**

It contains a lot of **ethanol**, the drying alcohol, for those of you who want to avoid it. Alcohol is usually used as a solvent for other ingredients and elegant fast drying effects/enhancing skin penetration.

**Good Things:**

[**Here's a great breakdown of chemical vs physical sunscreens by Labmuffin**](https://labmuffin.com/chemical-vs-physical-sunscreens-the-science-with-video/)

&#x200B;

**Why are there so many recent products with a lot of essential oils?**

I personally think it's because **essential oils** get a pass rating of ""**1**"" in EWG (Environmental Working Group) but **fragrance** gets an ""**8**"". This is quite a biased way of looking at it because they're basically the same thing. But one is modified while the other is not. And uncontrolled substances tend to have a higher chance of causing allergies and other issues.

There are hundreds of chemicals that make up essential oils. There may be skin benefits from other components of EOs but also skin-sensitizing chemicals.

Some companies still list modified essential oils in the ingredient list, such as when they **take out** the **phototoxicity** causing chemicals in **citrus oils** specifically for use in cosmetics.

&#x200B;

**What about preservatives?**

There's been a lack of **broad-spectrum preservatives** in both AB and Western skincare lately, due to most people not understanding their true safety data/the fear of ""chemicals"", pressuring companies to change the preservatives that have been used in the industry due to great efficacy and long term safety track record.

Parabens are actually quite ""natural"" if you want to nitpick, as they're isolated chemicals from fruits and veggies like carrots, cucumbers, and blueberries.

&#x200B;

**1,2-Hexanediol** is a **preservative booster** as well as a moisture-binding ingredient, that I have seen used *very* often in Korean products. It has *some* antimicrobial properties, but it does not prohibit the growth of bad shit by itself. It's usually used in conjunction with other gentle preservatives to boost them up.

**Disodium EDTA** is another preservative booster, often used when a product contains a lot of plant extracts.

&#x200B;

Antioxidants like **vitamin E, rosemary extract, grapefruit seed extracts are** ***antiOXIDANTS, NOT*** **preservatives.** They work to slow **rancidity**, like in oils. They **don't stop** things from growing.

For your safety, please do not DIY lotions and creams or anything containing water without proper preservatives; Also avoid homemade skincare that is sold at Etsy & elsewhere that I see way too often without preservatives. Things without water are okay.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Interesting interview about the state of current cosmetic industry:**

[**This interview with a cosmetic chemist is an excellent source to get a deeper understanding of people pressuring companies to forgo preservatives.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSDTTrGncns) & How using ""natural"" things in skincare can be polluting the environment more than we thought, compared to lab-made chemicals.

Sun sticks or sun cushion? Which do you prefer and why?,"I'm debating how I should go about reapplying sunscreen. There are some pros and cons that I've gathered so far.

Sun sticks:

Pro - convenient and easy to wipe off bacteria with alcohol wipe

Con - may be harder to get around crevices, like the nose and eye area. Weirder to apply a deodorant-like stick onto your face in public (say on a train or bus)


Sun cushions: so I plan on not refilling a sponge for hygienic reasons and also to avoid the sun screen going bad (you risk exposing it to air more frequently after pouring it into a cushion, i.e. liquid sunscreen wasn't formulated to last in this condition/outside the tube). I plan on just keeping an empty cushion case with the blender and just carry around the tube of sunscreen then apply as needed. This also saves on product waste since I won't be soaking a sponge with the sunscreen. 

Pros - convenient, will have a mirror on the go, will be able to reach crevices on the face like the eye and nose. 

Cons - sponges tend to accumulate bacteria and grime more often which is what's steering me away from using this method.",1562953586.0,0.91,15
[Review] Etude House Soon Jung Line,"My skintype: highly sensitive, acne-prone, oily dehydrated skin.

Environment: humid all year round in Malaysia. 

WNR - would not repurchase

MRP - might repurchase

HG - holy grail

*= broke out my sensitive skin but did show some effects, so it might work for you

*pH 5.5 Relief Toner*

WNR - This is a HG for many people, its sad it couldnt make it to my HG list. This toner doesn’t really hydrate my dry skin, it feels oily and it pills on top of my skin instead of hydrating. I would rather go back to my Hada Labo Light toner to properly hydrate my skin. 

*10 Free Moist Emulsion* 

MRP - I love how the emulsion doesn’t pills on my skin compared to other emulsions normally does on me. Absorbs well, actually pretty moisturizing on its own. Doesn’t leave any irritation on me, which is a bonus. 

*2x Barrier Intensive Cream*

MRP - I have been looking for a decent moisturiser that won’t cause any breakouts on my sensitive acne prone skin and I think I finally found it. I don’t feel it moisturize my face better than my TO squalane oil, however I would consider repurchasing this in case I can’t get my hands on my squalane oil any time soon. 

*5 Panthensoside Cica Balm*

MRP - This cica balm is a HG for some people too, saying it helped their skin tremendously. I bought this balm expecting it to perform like it claim, to reduce redness and shrink acne. I have been using this for several weeks, but I don’t see any improvements on my redness nor my acne. Yes, this balm has a soothing effect but it doesn’t really improve anything else besides just soothing the skin. Bonus to this for not causing me any breakouts. 


*Pros* : 
- doesn’t cause any breakouts 
- suitable for sensitive skin 
- does soothe the skin

*Cons*: 
- doesn’t help improve redness or acne
- not very hydrating for dehydrated skin",1562948748.0,0.95,5

Reviews of All the AB Products/Brands I Have Tried,"My skin type: oily, semi acne-prone, sensitive to scarring

// all of these reviews are my personal opinions and please remember that products work differently for everyone. I am not a professor of skin care ingredients, I just want to share my own experience of products I used (long post) //

[ **COSRX**]

• **AHA WHITEHEAD LIQUID**: I have seen so much hype for this products, and I looked forward to this product getting rid of my whiteheads or smoothing my skin with its AHA. It did nothing for me, I kept trying to use it hoping something would happen but I saw no improvement. I'd leave it on my skin for 3 hours after school everyday, it just felt like a left  a watery lotion layer on my skin and that is it. 

• **BHA BLACKHEAD LIQUID**: Again, same hype I saw, same expectation I had, same experience. If there's anything I can give credit for,  I'd say it absorbs well/fast though I saw no results using it. My blackheads on the nose weren't improved, it felt like an unnecessary skin care step for me. 

• **Rice Sleeping Mask**: I absolutely loved it! Though I stopped using it since my skin grew other concerns than dullness. This sleeping mark absorbs fast and left my skin hydrated, but it got a bit oily after a while. For a product you can find under $14,  this product does what it promises. Just don't expect it to leave your skin dewy, instant bright etc. 

• **AC COLLECTION SPOT TREATMENT**: HG!!!! I CAN'T SHOW ENOUGH LOVE FOR THIS. I purchased it when I was stressed with exams, got random pimples on my cheeks every now and then and of course, the scars of past acnes. The product lasts for a long time and doesn't irritate my skin. It actually helps my acnes to dry up within 3-5 days and the acnes tend to leave no scars. 

• **ACNE PIMPLE MASTER PATCH**: I can't say much about it except that it works. Though it only works for acnes that already show heads, I wouldn't consider it a HG. It didn't (magically) smoothen then calm the acne spot as it was advertised. 

• **SNAIL 96 MUCCIN POWER ESSENCE**: I knew this product got a lot of love on this sub Reddit but I couldn't bring myself to love it. It felt sticky, wouldn't absorb at all which made it harder for me to apply the left of my skin care routine. I gave up on it after 2 week of use. 

[ **LANEIGE ]

• **WATER SLEEPING MASK**:  HG! I am on my 4th bottle right now. It's soooo soothing and hydrating. It absorbs into my skin the moment I pat, leaving my skin matte. It's easily found on Amazon or eBay for <$18. It does have fragrance but I'm not bothered by it, it smells fresh actually. My skin is always brightened in the morning and soft after using this sleeping mask. 

[ **INNISFREE ]

• **TANGERINE VITA C CREAM**:  I recently grew a huge obsession with vitamin C. I know this product isn't popular, most don't even know it existed. And honesty, most don't know about it because IT ABSOLUTELY DID NOTHING. Citrus smell, gel-like texture, absorbs nicely, but did absolutely nothing besides drying my skin after 30 mins of application

• **MINERAL OIL FREE CUSHION**: I love it! It has a mint-y feel after you apply it, keep the oil under control for <3 hours. 

• **PORE WHITENING SLEEPING MASK**: Like I said, I was obsessed with Vitamin C. This sleeping mask comes in a huge bottle (100mL), I'm currently still using it. It absorbs well only if you spend 60 seconds patting it, though it does brighten my scars and skin tone, doesn't cause acne or irritation. 

• **PORE WHITENING SERUM**: The texture of this serum was exactly like its sleeping mask. I hated it. I foam up on my skin, made it impossible to apply the next product without leaving a mess. 

• **JEJU ORGANICE GREEN TEA SEED SERUM** : I don't hate it or nor love it. I only use it once in a while when I'm bored to be frank. It doesn't really help much with anything, maybe a little bit of hydration? I find it to stay on the skin rather than absorbing in. I expected it to soothe my redness after I went out in the sun, but again, like I said, it didn't do much. 

[ **SKIN&LAB**]

• **RED SERUM**:  I was intrigued by the name, looked up the info and found the product to contain many new ingredients and source of Vitamin C. It offered to brighten up your skin, anti-aging,  and moisturize. It has kind of a weird scent, very light,  absorbs easily and so far I see my skin getting that glow using it without any acnes or irritation. 

[ **ETUDE HOUSE** ] 

• **TONING WHITE C TONE UP CREAM**:  Gel-like texture, keeps my oil under control better than most tone up creams I have used. It doesn't really moisturize well though it does tone up the skin, doesn't cause acne. The toneup doesn't really has the glow effect I expect but it's a fine product. I'll use it for longer to see if it brightens up skin tone overall other than just toning up. 

• **TONING WHITE C SLEEPING MASK**:  The texture is super familiar with the Innisfree Pore Whitening Sleeping Mask. Absorbs nicely, has a fresh lemon smell. My face doesn't feel oily after using it, I sort of love it. It's light and perfect for the summer use. 

• **MY LASH SERUM**:  I have only started using it for 2 weeks but I have noticed my lashes getting curlier and my lower lashes are a tad longer. Kind of shocked(?). It works so well for a product under $5

• **VITA C TALK GEL CREAM**:  Lightweight, but definitely doesn't do anything besides hydrating. It's not bad, but when I bought a Vitamin C product I really expect it to brighten my skin rather than just hydrating. 

•**ETUDE HOUSE MOISTFUL COLLAGEN CREAM**:  My skin is responsive to it, it leaves my skin moisturized the second it's tapped. A tiny bit of product is enough to cover my face. An amazing moisturizer for such a price imo. Isn't outstanding but if you're just looking for an affordable product to moisturize, this is it

[**TONY MOLY*"" ]

• **Vita 12 Synergy Cream**: Absolutely hate it. It has a yellow-ish color and smells awful. It gave me bad break-out and I couldn't find myself wanting to touch that product again after a week of use. 

• **GREEN VITA C SPARKLING SERUM**: I think this is the only product I have found of Tony Moly that doesn't contain unbearable fragrance. My skin likes it, not necessarily love it. Does it absorb? Yes. Does it reduce acne scar appearance? Yes. But it feels oily, not extremely but I couldn't stand it when my face feels like an oily pan. 

[ **GLOW RECIPE** ]

• **WATERMELON SLEEPING MASK**: OMG GUYS I CAN'T LOVE THIS ENOUGH! Put aside the fact that you have to mix it every 2 nights so the texture isn't separated, it gives me such a good glow. I have felt in love with this and thought this was the only good product worth spending $45 for. It takes care of my acnes scar, brighten my skin, feel amazing on my skin. Definitely helped with my most concerns: acne and dullness

• **WATERMELON PINK JUICE MOISTURIZER**: I wanted to love it, I really did but the texture of this moisturizer never absorbed on my skin. It even made my skin oilier. Such huge disappointment. 

• **SWEET CHEF BEET + VITAMIN A SERUM**:  I found this art Target,  was intrigued since Glow Recipe made this. It does leave me a glowy look after the first use but it's so hard to take the product to use that I couldn't be bothered to continue using it. If they ever make this product easier to come out I'll definitely repurchase


• **SWEET CHEF KALE + VITAMIN B SERUM**: It's meant for dry skin, I bought it out of curiousity though of course my skin hated it. Couldn't absorb, texture is too thick for a serum. 

• **SWEET CHEF GINGER + VITAMIN C SERUM**: The only product my skin lives for out of three. Not an ordinary Vitamin C Serum but it's cheap and easy to find for me, it does what vitamin C suppose to do. My skin tone is so responsive to it! 

[ **ROHTO** ]

**MELANO CC ESSENCE SPOT TREATMENT**: I used it a couple times but stopped when I had too much Vitamin C related skin care. I surprisingly reduced my acne appearance after the first use I was shook honestly. But I didn't like the idea of using tube personally, it just felt tiring squeezing it on my finger for but. I knew it help the product to not be oxidized but definitely not my cup of tea. The product overall was amazing. 

[ **NEOGEN**] 

**VITAMIN C SERUM**: It contains 22% of vitamin C + Niacinamide so I was afraid it would be too irritating. The result was opposite of what I expected, HG! Absorbs easily with a couple pats, doesn't have fragrance and my skin has never been more pleased. It faded my super old acne scars that my other products couldn't. I really recommend everyone to give it a look if you're looking for a new Vitamin C serum. 

[ **KLAIRS** ]

• **FRESHLY JUICED VITAMIN E MASK**:  The texture is weird, and really hard to apply imo. It also contains cica kind of smell. I tried to use it at the end of my routine but the texture if its just ended up make my serums a mess (it foamed up) 

• **FRESHLY JUICED VITAMIN C**:  Contains only 5% vitamin C. It's gentle but not my cup of tea. I think it's good for sensitive skin people but for me, I didn't see any result using it. The white glass of this product gave me anxiety as well as it made the product oxidize easier.",1562942018.0,0.97,23

This is so good, it has a semi-matte finish, no white-cast and feels very hydrating.

Easy to spread, easy to re-apply, kept my t-zone less oily, what more could you want? Oh and it's 8$ for 50ml.

*Filters*: **Homosalate**, **Avobenzone**, **Tinosorb S**, **Octocrylene**

&#x200B;

\- **Missha Aqua Sun Gel SPF 50+ PA++++**

Very similar in texture to the A'pieu one, but I think this one might've clogged my pores. Still used it up because it was also really really good. This one also has a minor mattifying effect. It also costs \~8$ for 50ml.

*Filters:* **Homosalate**, **Avobenzone**, **Tinosorb S**, **Octocrylene**

&#x200B;

\- **Canmake Mermaid Skin UV Gel SPF SPF 50+ PA++++**

This one is very popular in this sub, everyone here praises it and loves it. I'm not here to dethrone it, everything that's been said about this one is true; fragrance-free, white-cast free, alcohol free, all the bad things. It spreads beautifully, it makes your skin glow. BUT, it's expensive. 12.50$ for 40ml is too much for me.

*Filters:* **Octinoxate, Uvinul A Plus, Zinc Oxide, Titanium Dioxide, Tinosorb S**

&#x200B;

\- **Biore Aqua Rich UV Essence 2019 SPF 50+ PA++++**

The cult-favorite sunscreen, the holy grail, the magical sunscreen that solves all of your problems.

Nope.

We've all heard of this sunscreen, we've all tried it or have wanted to try it, well I'd tell you, skip the 2019 one. I have previously tried the 2017 formulation and it was great, it didn't feel like anything, absorbed easily, just overall perfect. But this one, oh honey, no. They went somewhere wrong with the formula because this one leaves a disgusting sticky residue on my skin and aggravates my oil production. The only positive thing about this sunscreen is that it makes my skin glow.

If you have oily skin, do not get this. Maybe it works for dry/normal skinned folks, but my oily friends - you will regret purchasing this one.

*Filters:* **Octinoxate, Tinosorb S, Uvinal A Plus**

&#x200B;

\- **Balea Sundance Sensitiv Sonnenfluid SPF 50**

The only european sunscreen in this review. It has an amazing texture, really hydrating, no bad ingredients, but, it certainly does have a white-cast that doesn't fade. I use this as a body sunscreen.

*Filters:* **Uvinal A Plus, Titanium Dioxide (Nano), Ensulizole**

&#x200B;

\- **Innisfree Triple Care SPF 50+ PA++++**

The worst white-cast I've ever experienced, absolutely disgusting smell and made people think I had some disease because it made me that pale. Do not get this.

I haven't been able to really find anything within AB, which makes me a little sad-- the products I've tried so far play really well with my skin + routine.

Korean Vacation Haul + Review~,"I went on a trip to Korea a few weeks ago and was meaning to review these products sooner, but ended up taking a vacation to Thailand too! So I'll throw in a review for the few products I bought there too.

Background: I have very fair, combo/dry skin, live in a humid climate, and have lots of hyperpigmentation, scarring, and hormonal acne.

**Peripera Ink Skin Tint in #1 Ivory - 5/5**

I absolutely love this foundation, it's a really fair price, about 9000 won and it's perfect for the light days where I want very little coverage. Which is pretty much everyday...I'm comfortable with my skin for the most part, and I love how it shows my summer freckles. The shade range is awful, but it's so light that it almost doesn't matter. The shade is almost too light for me right now, but I suspect in the winter it will be a dead on match. When I don't want to use my trusty laneige cushion, this is what I have been reaching for to feel a little more put together.

&#x200B;

**3CE Heart Pot Lip in #Woody Rose - 4.5/5**

I went into Stylenanda expecting not to get anything, but this caught my attention. It's a travel sized lip pot with a little mirror and everything and it's got the cutest packaging. If I recall correctly it was about 6000 won, so not too expensive for 3CE. And let me tell you, I love the colour so much. It's the most perfect, disney princess, rosebud, but still natural look. This is what I wear when I want to look natural, but want that soft red to contrast with my features. The reason it's not a full 5 stars is that it's not particularly long wearing, but I still love it.

&#x200B;

**Innisfree my blush in #5 - 5/5**

I'm not going to lie, I got this as a free gift for the obscene amount of money I spent at innisfree buying backups of my HG moisturizer, the innisfree green tea seed cream. I would have never picked this shade out, but it's my favorite thing I got. It's a beautiful, rosy brown that is the exact shade that my skin blushes. It genuinely looks like I was just caught in the sun, and it lasts very well, I'm so glad that I got it.

&#x200B;

**Innisfree Smart Drawing Blusher in 01 - 4/5**

I had super high expectations for this blush, it came highly recommended and was even compared to the Glossier cloud paints (non-ab), one of my favorite cream blushes. This is really good! I love the scent, the color is a bit light, but still really natural and pretty. But my main issue is the applicator, like the cloud paints, I always feel like I'm wasting product and ultimately, money. I do like it though, and would like to try some different colors because the formula is super nice and cooling.

&#x200B;

**VT Cosmetics BT21 Lipstick in 01 (Shooky) - 5/5**

Let me be honest, I only bought this because I stan BTS. Yoongi, the man who created shooky, isn't even my bias (though I do adore him), but I was pleasantly surprised by this lipstick. The formula is good, nothing particularly special, it's a nice, creamy lipstick with a satin matte finish. But what surprised me was the beautiful colour of this lipstick. It's a perfect, rosy browny nude that can go with literally any look I wear. It's not too cool, it's not too warm, it just makes my lips look soft and plush and not unlike a disney princess'. It's my new go to shade and I love it.

&#x200B;

**Peripera ASMR Lip Balm in #1 - 2/5**

I've been searching for the perfect baby pink lipstick, one that would be sweet and nice, without pulling too Barbie dreamhouse on me. I picked this up with high hopes, but unfortunately it's not quite the right shade on me. I prefer more muted tones, and it's just a hair too bright. The formula isn't awesome, it's a bit gloopy, and I don't like that I can't twist down. I think I'm going to donate it to a friend because it's just not doing it for me.

&#x200B;

**Peripera Airy Ink Velvet in 05 Genius Rosy Pink - 4.5/5**

I do have another peripera ink tint in the original formula, and I love it! But I saw this on sale at olive young and I think I like this one even more. It's a gorgeous pink, with a finish that makes your lips look pillowy. But I don't like it best on it's own. I think that it works better as a sort of ""inner lip"" finisher or blotted.  It lasts pretty well, and I really like it. The .5 is docked because I wish it was just a bit softer.

&#x200B;

**Peripera Sugar Twinkle Liquid Eyeshadow in #12 - 5/5**

I bought this in hopes that it would satisfy my want for the Stila liquid shadows, and boy did this do the job. It is the most beautiful sparkle, that can be built up, or blended out in a sheer wash of sparkle that just catches the light. I can't speak to all the shades, but I love this so much.

&#x200B;

\~Bonus Thai Products\~

**4u2 Heart Me Cream Blush in Sweet as You - 3/5**

To be honest, not my favorite cream blush formula. The color is amazing, but it's too matte for my tastes. I want to play around with it more to see if I can try applying it with a brush or sponge to see if I can make it work for me. It's got such cute packaging and is a wonderful brown/red.

&#x200B;

**4u2 Hello Kitty Mousse Tint in Peach- 3/5**

I bought this because of packaging and the pretty peach color. But the formula is not a mousse, it's just a liquid lipstick and it doesn't particularly smell good. I'm not so into liquid lipstick anymore, and this formula isn't quite what I look for anymore. I'm going to play around with different gloss combos and pairing it with other lipsticks that I like, but if I don't end up liking it, I'll give it to a friend.

[Review] SOS: Save Our Skin – Mediheal P.D.F. AC- Defense Nude Gel Mask,"[This mask yall.](https://www.masksheets.com/p-d-f-ac-defense-nude-gel-mask-g.html)

&#x200B;

[Mediheal P.D.F. A.C.–Defense Hydro Nude Gel Mask. It's a mouthful, and I don't know what any of those acronyms mean.](https://i.redd.it/cte9of4nrs931.jpg)

&#x200B;

So when I first opened this I was caught a little off guard, because I'd bought it without knowing that it was a gel mask. The plastic guard and the mask itself are both clear so I literally thought I'd bought a defective one that was missing its mask lol.

When I saw this in the store, I just read the words ""pore refining/sebum control"" and instantly I was SOLD. Usually I shouldn't believe everything on the packaging but I guess I lucked out because it did everything it claimed it would do and more.

&#x200B;

I paid 4000 won at Olive Young, and for the quality of this thing, it's a damn steal. Of course, if I wanted to make this a regular and use it every week, it'd add up but STILL. Compared to some of those pricy ampoule masks out there, it's the next best thing.

&#x200B;

As you might have guessed, I have intensely oily skin, and because my skin thinks it's such a great idea to pump out enough sebum to grease a pan, I also have intensely big pores, and my past acne scarring makes some of them look like they're permanently open, like a pothole in my face.

&#x200B;

I'd been pretty lazy in terms of skincare and decided that today would be the ""revamp day."" I went all out. I wish I had the diligence to do this every day lol.

Here is what I used besides the mask, and what probably helped make sure it worked.

1. Oil Cleanse: Erno Laszlo Phelityl Oil
2. La Roche Posay Effaclar Gel Cleanser for Oily Skin
3. Mario Badescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs, and Rosewater
4. Mediheal P.D.F. A.C.– Defense Hydro Nude Gel Mask
5. TheFaceShop Dr. Belmeur Cica Peptite Ampoule

The mask comes in two parts, for the top and bottom half of the face. This makes customizing the size to different face shapes easier and because it's a gel, it sticks to your face so well, but it does not leave a sticky residue.

I really should've taken a before/after photo but I didn't expect this mask to show results so immediately – I thought it was one of those that I had to use consistently to start seeing differences but my pores looked visibly tightened, and my face looked more plump. Most of all, my skin looked *clean.* Usually when I start putting face products after washing my face, I feel as if some of the products that I use don't absorb all the way and leave my pores looking just as big as before washing. But my face looked satisfyingly clear.

I do admit I left it on for longer than advised, but by the time I went to take it off, my skin had basically sucked the moisture out of the gel sheet.

Although I am one to finish my skin routine AT the sheet mask on the days I use them, the juice from the gel mask had absorbed so freakin well that I thought I'd put an extra step that would provide a good barrier for my skin as I went to bed.

&#x200B;

This mask is one of those I'd recommend to use before going out, a date, an important event, or on days you just want to look good because of how supple it leaves the skin, it'd be a good primer for base makeup.

**Overall:**

* Mask is a two gel sheets that can fit on any face
* The gel nature of the sheet makes the skin really absorb the mask serum
* Does not leave the face with excess serum on the face, pores noticeably tighter
* Sebum-controlling component make this mask a good primer before base makeup, can be a daytime mask acting as a foundation primer that can also protect skin from pollution, dust, etc.
* Face should be especially well-cleansed before using mask to ensure getting the most out of it.
* Mask serum is lighter than how it feels on the hands – highly buildable on top, whether it be ampoules or creams.
* Would recommend storing in fridge before use. Face feels plumper and it just feels good to have your face suck on a cold, slimy, gel sheet.
* Would take caution when taking the plastic guard off the mask – the mask was pretty slippery when it came out it was a bit difficult to separate the plastic layer from the gel layer. The sheet for the upper face has TWO plastic guards on each side... that confused me a little bit,",1562905840.0,0.92,4

[Review] Rohto Skin Aqua UV Moisture Milk.. Possible Holy Grail,"For a while I have been on a search for sunscreens that don’t have whitecast and are also waterproof (I sweat easily and it’d be a waste to sweat off sun protection 10 mins after going outside) and saw a lot of positive feedback for this sunscreen. I am also caramel skinned so having little to no whitecast is important to me, no one wants to look pasty.

I had previously bought a sunscreen by Neutrogena that was SPF 100+ and was super disappointed, in store the whitecast seemed minimal but applied it was terrible, thats when I realized I needed to investigate into better sunscreen and decided to try an AB brand. I decided on this one because it was waterproof as well which is very important to me.

I have been using it about a week and I really love it!! It is thin and not pasty like American sunscreens, glides on very easily. It is a little oily if you use a lot but rubbed into skin is no different than a good moisurizer, definitely gives you some glow as opposed to washing you out. It has no whitecast when rubbed in so it is definitely suitable for brown skin and maybe even darker. I have also used it before working out outside and when sweating you can see a little whitecast but wiped away is almost nothing. It is also 100% better than what has happened to me when using an American sunscreen.

I’m really liking it and would definitely rebuy. I got mine off of ebay for about 15, it is the newest 2019 edition of this sunscreen. The only negative is the bottle is small for price but to me definitely worth it for how good it is and pretty affordable for the benefit. I also really like that the applicator is small, I just draw lines on my face with the bottle and rub it in as opposed to squirting some on your hands like lotion and applying it that way like I was doing before. 

If you are tan/darker skinned and looking for waterproof sunscreen or no whitecast I definitely recommend trying it.",1562874004.0,0.88,5

Counter-intuitive Beauty Tip: Diluting acids makes it more acidic,,1562854109.0,1.0,2
[Guide] A Really short introduction to Asian Beauty for newbies.,"## What's Asian Beauty (AB)? 

Cosmetics from Asia. Simple as that. 

## Will Asian cosmetics be better for my skin? 

That depends on your needs and concerns. The industry is somewhat different, but the products themselves aren't exactly groundbreaking or special compared to western options. Just think of it as widening your shopping options.

## What's my skin type? How do I find it? Why does it matter?

Generally you want to assess your skin type when it's completely bare. Wash with water, and then try to see how it responds. 

* **Oily** - Your skin produces sebum fairly quickly, enough for it to get visible in a short time. 
* **Dry** - Your skin products little to no sebum, or takes too long to do so, thus making your face feel dry. Often sensitive.  
* **Combination** - Only your nose and forehead (T-Zone) gets oily.
* **Normal** - Your skin feels fine as it is. 

Skin types aren't permanent, it depends on other aspects such as the state of your hormones or even the climate you reside in. Some people see shifts in their skin based on weather or even indoor temperatures. 

Knowing your skin type is important because you want to build a skincare routine around it. If your routine doesn't fit you, then you're likely to cause more problems to yourself. 

## What kind of products are out there? 

1. **Cleanser** - To clean your face with. There are generally two types of cleansers that are mentioned: Surfactant based (Example: Soap) and Oil based (Oils are good at breaking down things, hence why it's used as a cleanser). 
2. **Toner / Skin / Lotion** - A light watery product with the goal to hydrate your skin. 
3. **Essence / Serum / Ampoule** - Products with the goal of providing a higher concentration of a specific ingredient. 
4. **Moisturizing Cream / Moisturizing Gel / Emulsion** - Moisturizers
5. **Sunscreen** - To protect from the sun. SPF refers to UVB protection. PA/PPD refers to UVA protection.  
6. **Sleeping Masks / Occlusives** - Product with the goal of trapping moisture underneath it. 
7. **Wash Off Masks / Sheet Masks** 

There are other product types, but for the sake of clarity and being a beginner guide it's best to just have these in mind. 

### Do I need to use all of these products? 

No. Routines are individual and personal. Do what's comfortable for you. 

As an example here are some (not all) reasons why you may not need certain products: 

* Some oily skinned people may not want moisturizers at all and use only a Toner / Skin / Lotion. 
* Essence / Serum / Ampoule aren't the only product types with a concentration of an ingredient. You can find plenty of ingredient focus moisturizers or even toners. 
* Some people tend to feel more dryer with a cleanser, and simply washing their face with water. 

### What's the most core routine? 

1. Cleanser
2. Moisturizer 
3. Sunscreen 

### Do these products have to be used in a specific order? 

No. Go lightest to heaviest as a general guide. Main exceptions are: 

* **Sunscreen**: Should always be last in the morning.  
* **Occlusives / Sleeping Masks**: Should be last at night. 

### Are there products more important than others? 

This is a pretty personal question. While some may immediately respond 'sunscreen', there may be those who lead a life with little to no sun exposure: Working late night shifts, living somewhere where the sun isn't up much, etc. What's most important depends entirely on your skin and your needs. 

## Is there anything else I need to know? 

Naturally, like many other things, there is a lot more information than presented. But trying to consume it all as a newbie will do you no good and only complicate things for absolutely no reason. Some things are more advanced with reason, and it would be a bit risky to do anything with the more advanced steps without even understanding the basics.",1562828584.0,1.0,6

[REVIEW] HOLIKA HOLIKA MAKE UP SUN CREAM 60ML - AWFUL EXPERIENCE WITH SMELL,"Hello everyone,  
I just received my order of the Holika Holika Make up sun cream 60 ML (PA+++ SPF 50+). Here is my review:  
\- **Texture : 10/10 :** It's not too thick or too runny, its texture is a bit similar to the Skin Aqua Tone up UV Essence / A'pieu Madecassoside Sun Cream   
\- **Sun protection :** Physical filter (Zinc Oxide, info from CosDNA.com, although I'm not sure what % ), good for sensitive skin. I have been wearing it for 4 hours and so far no allergy, no burns  
\- **SMELL : 0/10 .** The smell is floral and nice, and I have no problem with a little fragrance from time to time, but the smell LINGERS AFTER 4 HOURS OF WEAR JUST LIKE A PERSISTENT EX.  It made my nose really sensitive and stuffed, and I had to wipe off the sunscreen patch in front of my nose.  


If you do not want a stuffed nose, or you simply hate fragrance in your cosmetics, AVOID THIS PRODUCT ASAP.

[Discussion] Does anyone feel a bit self conscious about their pale skin due to avoiding sunlight?,"I can't be the only one that feels this. I'm an Asian male (mid 20s) who got obsessed with skin care after I had gotten moderate acne back in high school. Ever since then I've been avoiding the sun due to the fear of making my hyper-pigmented spots from acne even darker or worsening them. As a result I am pale as a vampire. Porcelain in colour. I know some of you might think, ""that's the skin colour I want"", that's fine, but as a guy, I can't help but feel less masculine, especially when I'm around my other male Asian friends who are all tan.

Being this pale has taken a toll on my confidence somewhat as I feel like I would get labelled. Labelled as in, some might think I'm a FOB (fresh off the boat) or someone who doesn't go outside. My relatives tell me I need to get a tan to get some colour in me/ I don't look healthy (even though I'm perfectly healthy). I can't be the only one that feels this. 

I look back at photos before I got acne, enjoying life in the sun and not caring about protecting it (while avoiding getting sun burnt). I looked healthier with that golden glow in my opinion. So here's a question, to what extent of sun exposure can it cause ageing in the long run/ wrinkles? I look at my sisters skin (shes mid 20s) and she doesn't care about avoiding/ protecting her skin as much yet her skin looks perfectly youthful with no wrinkles, no spots, not dry looking. Shes darker than I am because of sunlight. I want to get to that freedom again but also limiting myself.",1562731079.0,0.58,26
[Review] Pigeon UV Baby Milk Waterproof SPF 50+ PA++++,"&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vilsg9tn2e931.jpg

Haven't seen a review for this sunscreen yet so thought I'd post! This sunscreen uses physical filters only (zinc & titanium dioxide), is unscented, no alcohol, no parabens. See [ingredients](https://www.ratzillacosme.com/sun/pigeon-uv-baby-milk-waterproof-spf50/) at Ratzilla.

I've used this sunscreen consistently \~ 2 weeks now, so got a pretty good feel for it. I've used almost exclusively Japanese sunscreen since 2016, but recently with my raging hormones, I wanted to be safe and use products for sensitive skin. Also curious about Japanese physical sunscreen and wondered if they're better than my horrible experience with the Cerave one (which surprised me as their other skincare products minus sunscreen are solid). Well, surprisingly (or I guess not, considering the Japanese skincare market is brutal), it's much, much better.

**Application**: applies nicely without that really sticky feel of physical sunscreen (but then, my only reference is Cerave so maybe you won't be as pleasantly surprised as me). It **DOES** leave a white cast on my skin (Asian, about NC20-NC25), but disappears nicely after \~10 mins or so (works for me, that's when I start driving and start to put on my foundation - please don't report me to highway patrol :( ). **Unscented**.

**Feel**: throughout the day, it is not greasy, which is a plus for my combo skin. I've tried to experiment with layering just a moisturizing toner (Japanese lotion) beneath it, and by the time I put on my matte foundation, my skin feels pretty matte, bordering dry. If I use a moisturizing toner, then light emulsion, then the Pigeon and matte foundation, it's perfect. I'd say if you have oily skin but don't use foundation, or use a dewy foundation, you may be able to get away with just a moisturizing toner. If you have dry skin, this one may be a tough sell - you'll probably have to layer quite a bit of hydration, as this sunscreen adds none.

**Effectiveness**: well, I've worn it exclusively for two weeks and within this time frame, my skin has gotten brighter (from other products - not the sunscreen, but that means it does what it claims to do). So I guess it works. It is truly waterproof - even after a 10 hr work day, when I come back and splash water on my face, it is still there and I can see the round water droplets roll down my face nicely - so yay, waterproof as it claims. I do use an oil cleanser on days I use it, as I'm doubtful just my Glossier jelly cleanser can get this baby off.

**Overall:** It's not exciting, but it gets the job done. Solid option for those with sensitive skin and want to try a physical sunscreen. It won't be as elegant as your chemical ones, but pleasant enough. Added this to the repertoire of my safe stash that I can always go back to if my skin decides to go full-blown crazy again. Regarding other physical sunscreens, I remember trying the Shigaisen Yohou in a store, and the application of that one felt much nicer, but it's also more expensive. If you have dry skin though, I feel like that's a better choice.

**Price**: I bought in on US Amazon for $13, which surprisingly is NOT tripled the Japanese retail price. Shocking.",1562726488.0,0.9,20

[Journal] 10 Year Skin Progress,"Hi everyone! This is my first post so let me know if I need to adjust or edit anything!

I wanted to share my 10 year skincare journey starting from when I was around 10-12 years old. It has been long and hectic but I have finally reached a point where I feel comfortable with my skin. I have shed many tears and experienced moments of intense frustration and self-hatred. I hope someone can listen to my story and regain hope :)

Skin type: Combination, acne-prone (especially T-zone), sensitive

After I hit puberty, my skin slowly became worse and worse. As an Asian girl, whose friends mostly had clear or clearer skin, this shattered my self-esteem. I was shy, withdrawn, and had terrible social skills (e.g. could not maintain eye-contact).

Phase 1: I’m sure many of you can relate. I tried drugstore products (neutrogena, St. Ives, Biore pore strips, alcohol-based toners, spot treatment all over my face etc.). I looked through youtube to find any home remedies. I tried everything, feeling desperate, but to no avail. I regret many of the things I did.

Phase 2: I discovered “natural skincare,” like the OCM and essential oil-based products. These, of course, broke my skin out even further. My mom finally decided to take me to a dermatologist, and I tried benzoyl peroxide cream but that only dried out my skin. I was seriously considering more serious medical treatments at the point in time. Although I wore makeup, random people would point out my terrible skin out in public. I remember one time I updated my FB profile with a slight filter, and one guy (a high school classmate) asked if I had used photoshop. I had little to no confidence in how I looked.

Phase 3: I found out about Asian skincare and my skin gradually became better, but I still took a lot of wrong turns. I first used popular brands like cosrx, etude house, and innisfree without analyzing the ingredients. Although my skin became more hydrated and even, the spots did not stop popping up. I also tried fermented products like the Kiku toner, only to realize that I was FA-prone. That was another revelation. I realized that I had to pay attention and track the ingredient lists of my products, so I began doing that. I realized that I was sensitive to A LOT of ingredients, which makes my routine pretty bland but my wallet happy haha\~ Some of those are: Alcohol (high in list), most oils (especially essential oils), fragrance, niacinamide (maybe), sodium acetylated hyaluronate, chemical UV filters, honey (maybe), anything FA-related, glycolic/lactic/salicylic acid (moderately), etc.). This all took so much trial and error, but my skin was finally improving.

Phase 4: After leaving home for university, I came to the conclusion that I had to take care of myself holistically. I needed to nurture my body, brain, and mind altogether. This occurred to me after my first experience of depression and anxiety. Therefore, I began watching what I ate. I reduced the amount of sugar, gluten (for digestive problems), dairy (except occasional yogurt and cheese), and general junk food that I ate. I exercised a little each morning when I felt energetic and well-rested. I found hobbies outside of coursework to ease my mental fatigue. I started going out more to improve my social skills. I also simplified my skincare immensely, cutting out anything I didn’t need. Even though it was tedious at first, all of these soon became habits. Through these past few months, I’ve felt significantly better both physically and mentally.

Conclusions + Routine: Everyone has a different path in terms of their skin struggles but please continue to keep pushing forward regardless of the extent of your problems. I believe that we can all have good, not perfect, skin. I know that there are genetic predispositions, which I believe pertain to the level of environmental sensitivity of the skin (e.g. food, hormones, stress, pollution). However, I believe that everyone has a range and when we make an effort, we can climb higher to clarity.

[Discussion] pH of hybrid products like the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner?,"I've started this discussion to see how you (collectively) feel about pH levels, if you know the pH of your products, if the pH makes an impact on your routine/order, or influences your product choices, and finally if anybody knows the pH of the new ""skip-care""/hybrid products like the hyped Laneige Cream Skin Refiner? Where would such hybrid products fit in to a ph-balancing routine? Can it really be used as a toner/essence/moisturizer like it claims? What kind of pH does it need to have to adequately fulfill all those roles?

Below are my own thoughts and a little background:

So I've been using probably 90% AB in my 5-to-10-step (depending on the time of day and season) skincare routine for nearly the last 2 years,  and although some of the products have switched up, I've overall seen great improvements with the traditional layering method. However, the biggest changes for me came when I started to deeply understand pH and its importance in healthy skin and I really got nerdy about the pH levels at which various actives work their best magic. 

See, I used to think that I had sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, until I realized that my skin wasn't sensitive or combination - it just wasn't ph-balanced. Nowadays, I can use much stronger products without worrying too much about the scary introduction phase, as long as I know the pH of a product and can fit it into my routine. Hell, most times I can tell by the ingredients and pH level of a product before I try it whether it'll be a hit for me or not.

Understanding pH, and even going so far as buying my own pH testing kit for all my products, really helped me to get the most out of my routine by allowing me to better layer in an optimal order so that my various actives weren't at competing pH levels on my skin (e.g. some items needed to go in a slightly counterintuitive order based on their ingredients, or they needed to be alternated by time of day or on different days based on other products). This in turn helped me reduce irritation and reactions.

I loooooove my long, drawn out AB skincare routine at night, but I'm admittedly always on the lookout for ways to shorten my routine in the morning. That's why I'm intrigued by the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner, especially since, as I've discovered that my skin type is actually mildly oily during the summer, I would love to be able to thin out my daytime layers and feel a little more refreshed. However, as a ph-lover, I'm a little disheartened that more pH info isn't available for a lot of products unless I can manage to get my hands on the physical bottle myself and test it. I really wish the pH range of products was just a default printed on the label as easily as the ingredients. I feel like this would be really helpful and could even tell people when things were outside their safe range as pH often changes over the life of a product. 

So are there any other pH nerds out there like me? Has anyone found or tested the pH of the LCSR or other hybrid products similar to it?",1562482136.0,1.0,9

[Discussion] What are your favorite inexpensive products?,"I was hoping in this thread we could share our favorite inexpensive products. Now I know that what is considered inexpensive is subjective but I think that under $20 might be a good mark. Personally I prefer products to be around $15 and under so that's the range I'm going to be suggesting myself. 

Here are my favorites that hopefully someone on a budget may appreciate knowing about. (I'm getting my pricing from Amazon I promise I'm not a shill for it lol)

**Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil: $10**

Everyone knows about this one. It's popular and reliable. 

**Innisfree Bija Jeju Anti-Trouble Cleansing Gel: $15**

This cleansing gel has a nice pH and what I like about it is that it doesnt bubble up at all. It stays a gel the whole way through. Its very gentle on my skin and doesn't leave my skin feeling tight. 

**Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid Hydra Power Essence: $15**

This is a simple essence that sinks into the skin nicely. It sinks in better when my skin is damp. Otherwise it can be slightly tacky. It's a nice hydrator and even better when sealed in with a moisturizer. I have oily skin so I use this alone in the morning with no moisturizer and it gives me just enough hydration. 

**Mizon Water Volume Ex Cream: $13**

I use this moisturizer at night time only since it really gives me that extra moisturization thats too heavy during the day. However its a nice light gel cream that sinks into my face super nicely and feels really cooling. This really makes my skin feel so smooth but I might search for something a tad lighter in the summer month. 

**Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish Sun Milk SPF 50+ PA +++: $10**

This is a mineral sunscreen and may not be for everyone. It makes my skin more matte even if I apply it when I'm really greasy. For oily people this might be great but for people who want to look really dewy this is not it. Its really light, sinks in super fast, feels nice and dry right away and has a pleasant faint lemony scent.

I buy things so you don't have to #1: MISSHA Flash-Up Sun SPF50+ PA++++ [Review],"I got this on a total whim because I was running out of ""indoor"" or transitory sunscreen and wanting something stronger as I'm starting to use Tretinoin from Curology and want stronger sunscreen protection.

I was using Etude House's Sunprise Mild Airy Finish whatever whatever, SPF 50 PA+++.

I grabbed this on Amazon cause it looked interesting & and my ""indoor"" sunscreen matters less and I've been wanting to explore.My needs in a sunscreen are: must be somewhat mattifying and can NOT be too oily or greasy, number one rule. I may alternate between sunscreens depending on needs.

&#x200B;

**Skintype: naturally oily t-zone, on tret & use professional strength chemical peels, so flakes & being dry are a thing now**

&#x200B;

Anywaysss:

&#x200B;

This is my first MISSHA sunscreen & possibly first product used (anything else was a sample). I grabbed it due to SPF & PA rating & interesting packaging, tbh. I skimmed the comments and a couple online reviews and went for it.

I have used it a few times. I like the packaging, I also rlly like holographic things. It squeezes out pretty easily. It is quite creamy, it's lotion-like & a little thick but not too much so. I don't particularly remember a smell but it wasn't strong if there is one. It spreads easily, though I do rub it in more than I am maybe supposed so.

It goes on looking like a horrible white cast, and will look sort of weirdly UBER SHINY or possibly UBER GREASY looking at first. This was a bit weird to me, but after a few uses, I've come to realize this was the ""flash up"" thing it advertises. It has a sort of uberly dewy & somewhat ""holographic"" look to it when first applied, and if you're dark, you may see a white cast. This does go away after sinking in for maybe a full thirty minutes.It doesn't feel heavy, and has a satin finish once settled. It does NOT have oil control, but it doesn't boast this, so. I will say it definitely doesn't seem to make it worse. My oil breaks through it in maybe 4 hours ish, and it stays semi dewy looking all day. I haven't tried makeup over it, only translucent powder.I'm unsure if it's another product cause this seems to happen on other days I don't use this, but it may be a bit much for on top of lids, as in slight stinging later in the day.

**I won't repurchase but I'm glad I tried it - I would suggest for those that are not oily, so normal to dry. Use only if you're cool with a slightly dewy look, and don't plan to rush out of the house right after applying. Give it time to settle, maybe 30mins - 1 hr. I have no issue w/ this as this is my ""Idgaf or I'm only indoors"" sunscreen.**

[Review] Daily Mild Sun Cream Pair,"Bought [this sunscreen](https://www.peachandlily.com/products/daily-mild-sun-cream-pair) from Peach & Lily. SPF 50+ PA++++

I just got back from a week-long trip in Iceland, where the sun currently only sets for about 2 hours/day (and even then, it doesn't fully set, so it's never truly dark outside) and I went on 10+ hour hikes a day almost every day. Even though it was Iceland, it was also unusually sunny - I'm from LA and most days it was honestly as sunny as it is in LA, which the locals said was very unusual. So basically it was a TON of sun exposure.

Y'all. This stuff is the STUFF. I have extremely sensitive skin that's also prone to burning and I often get new freckles. This was the first trip I've been on where I didn't even get a little pink, and I didn't get one new freckle! I only wore beanies, no sun hats or anything, so I have to chalk my skin protection entirely up to the Daily Mild Sun Cream. It definitely protected my skin during a week of intense sunlight!

The cream itself feels light, and a little goes a long way. I was very diligent about reapplying every two hours, so I was doing 6+ reapplications per day, and my face never felt really greasy or gross with all the sunscreen. It comes out of the tube white but applies on clear and glossy - but I'm also very pale, so ymmv on the color. It's actually almost borderline TOO glossy - if you're not ok with a glowy look, this probably won't work for your aesthetic. I can't imagine achieving a matte face with this sunscreen, though I have yet to try applying makeup over it - that said, I thought I looked great in it, just noting this detail for people who aren't interested in the glass skin look. 

The biggest (and only, for me) drawback is the amount in the bottles. As soon as I took them out of the box it was immediately clear that both bottles were only about half full. I only brought one bottle with me to Iceland, and by the end of my trip the bottle was nearly empty. I'm on week 3 of owning this sunscreen and I think I'll be done with the first bottle within the next few days - I'm looking forward to seeing how long the second bottle lasts under more normal circumstances. I don't know if I think the total amount of sunscreen for your money is unfair, but I DO think that the size of the bottles feels deceptive, and it was a little disappointing squeezing it for the first time and feeling a ton of air in the packaging. 

That said, the product was so effective and felt so nice that I will definitely be repurchasing. I've been on the hunt for a decent sunscreen for my sensitive, acne-prone skin for nearly two years, and this is easily the best one I've tried. 

Very excited to be contributing to this community - I'm so thankful for how much I've learned here, and I finally felt like I had some input to give back. Hope this helps someone!",1562260669.0,0.96,33
[Review] Half-Year Review + Local Products?,"Edit: Will fix formatting sorry 😭


Hey ABers! It's my first time writing a review here. It's a challenging sub kinda like I don't want to disappoint the readers here haha. 

Anyway so I'm from a Tropical country, very humid and scorching heat everyday. I have Combination leaning towards Oily when it's summer and Dehydrated Sensitive skin. Its my first time to use this much product so I thought I'll share my thoughts on them. Also, A speculation is at the bottom of the review! Let me know what you think of it.


**Exfoliator**


**CosRx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid**


*7/10*


I'm surprised this was effective at all. It broke me out maybe once or twice. Didn't use it for a month then came back then it's okay. But as time goes by I never notice any improvements just a quick smooting the next day but it always goes back. Will repurchase but maybe in samples cause you don't need much then you don't also need to do everyday 



**Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Clay Mask**


*6/10*


I'm surprised somehow this never dries down. Broke me out at first and I didn't see effects. But I like how it made me feel like I'm doing self care for myself. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't I hate my face for being too sensitive. 😭


***Cleansers***


**Innisfree Jeju Cleansing Foam**


*7/10*


Bought this just because it's on a sale; heard it's high in pH but surprisingly doesn't dry me out. WRP only if I find other seller (tax was too high)


**CosRx Good Morning Cleanser**


*4/10*


I really wanted to like this! It's not drying compared to what I expected it but this cause me to have CCs that I never had before. Such a waste since it's really the cheapest

**Face Shop Dr. Belmeur Daily Repair Foaming Cleanser**


*7/10*


This one I really like. Checks all the boxes for me. Not drying, the smell wasn't too bad, doesn't leave residue and cleans really well. However I can't justify it's price for some reason. It's really pricey here in my country since I assume import tax.

**Human Nature Sunflower Oil**


*10/10*


I used this as first cleanser before using CosRx and damn if this product isn't the best! This product can be used in multiple situations too! When it's really cold and my skin cracks I use this on my legs and elbows. I also use this as facial oil, mixing it with some cream. I think it also heals insect bites but I'm not too sure about that. This is the best selling product of this brand so I bought it just to see what it can do and it deserves it! Really cheap too maybe around 4-5$. 

**Brandless Papaya Soap**


*8/10*


This was a localproduct and it's from a local family business. Surprisingly didn't broke me out! I'm usually skeptic when using brandless product because I don't know what's in it. But I was at a camping/party and it's the only one available at that time so I risked it. It dried me out though however it also dried out my active pimples! I will probably keep using this whenever I have breakouts.

***Acne Care***




**Human Nature Green Tea Acne Care**


*10/10 HG FOREVER*


When I say 10/10, it's 10/10. It's also a local brand but lately they've been expanding I think they sell online now. This is my go-to product whenever I have breakouts. Just dab it allover every night, every morning first thing on my routine and the acne will be gone in less than a week. It forms a film like texture to protect the acne from absorbing more dirt. My only complain is after using it for so many months probably years it became less effective in a sense that it will heal the acne a tad longer. I guess it's not even on the product but on my tolerance but I still use it for acne protection. Also very cheap, 4$!


**CosRX Pimple Patch**


*5/10*


Hated this just because it kept falling and irritating my acne. It was supposed to dry it but it made my acne more inflamed. Guess I have to just find a more effective one.


**Moisturizer**



**Soon Jung 10-Free Moist Emulsion**


*9/10*



I use this as Moisturizer sooo, this is super hydrating and the only one that really worked for me without purging or going through seven hells. In sunny or even hot nights I hated this just because it made me sweat on my philtrum area because it's really thick. I really love this im a sense that it's one of the few that didn't broke me out and leave scars. I bought the small version and I'm still using it for 6 months!

**Mizon Snail Cream**


*4/10*


Why. Did. This. Broke. Me. Out. I really wanted to love this!! It's the best feel from all that I've tried but I guess not everything works for my face.

**Mizon Snail Recovery Gel**


*8/10*


This is a must in summer! Leaves a matte texture, dries out quickly and doesn't make me oily throughout the day. I purged on this so bad I had to stop using it. But when I came back after a few months it was okay again! Guess I just have to try and try. I don't know what happened but I'm happy it worked. It has dimethicone in it which I didn't know so I used it on evenings which I think is not a good idea.

**Dr. Belmeur Ato Salt Cream**


*8/10*


Used it on first quarter of the year which is really cold and dry and this works like magic. I really loved how heavy and hydrating it is so I sometimes layer it twice. BUT used it on summer and this is a sticky mess. Heated my face and caused me to break out.

I'm planning to try out


- *Skinfood Sugar Masks

- More Actives (I'm kinda afraid of them because my skin just always self detonate when exfoliating)

- Kikumasamune Lotion

- The Face Shop Rice Cleanser

- Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum

- More Local products

- Muji Toner and Moisturizer

- Laneige Water Bank*



Before I disappear I guess I wanna speculate how some local Products deem effective to my super sensitive skin. Is it because they're made specifically for our country's weather and majority of my nation's skin? Although I'm afraid cause there's a big risk of these products being discontinued as the sales are not as big as international brands. It's really amazing how all the local products I tried were effective. Or maybe it's just luck? Have you guys tried any local products that you really loved? I'm looking forward to seeing more potential local brands in the future!",1562256424.0,0.92,23

Welcome the two newest mods to our team, /u/thecaticorn and /u/conceptizual! They’ve actually been about, doing various modly things for the last few months, and we are super late at properly welcoming them to you.


Our new mods were chosen after our selection process, and we have been slowly training and integrating them into the mod work. We had one other mod /u/4soeur, who was recruited at the same time, but has since stepped back due to an international move. She has extensive experience modding other communities, loves gardening, and is an accomplished mother. We wish her well and all the luck! 

And to introduce our remaining recruits, /u/thecaticorn is a strong person working on her independence after graduation, and /u/conceptizual is a cheerful, easy-going and personable human. We are so lucky to have them, and thank you both for volunteering your time for the community!

More hands on deck, and more fresh ideas to add to the team! Some fun facts about our new mods:

/u/conceptizual: 

* Software engineer, loves to build infrastructure, maybe even things like mod queues
 
* Heritage is half-Mexican, but with self-described “solidly mediocre Spanish”

* May be our first-ever extrovert

* Really wants a pet dog but not yet

* Kpop fan, even covers dances in her spare time.

* her favorite thing she did to improve her skin was “stop being 14”

/u/thecaticorn:

* Recent IT undergrad

* Australian Representing, Indian heritage

* Solid AB community veteran

* Like all good people, also loves Avatar the Last Airbender (And Korra!)

* Into bubble tea as self-care

* Snowboarding beginner

Ever thought about joining the team yourself? Help steer the direction of your subreddit community! We can sometimes take a while to respond to (as we are not always in a recruitment cycle), but
 we encourage you to consider applying. We especially wish to recruit from diverse timezones for better ongoing support of the sub during all hours. We are also hoping to add perspectives from folks from LGBT+/Queer/GSM/SAGA backgrounds, folks with disabilities, older folks, and anyone with a unique perspective and a dedication to the community. Come apply! 

We love the folks who are great at self-motivated learning, diplomacy, seeing all sides of an issue, and being a good team player, as you will be working on a team with other mods from around the world. Experience modding other subs or large communities could be helpful but not required.

**Build Me A Routine, /r/AsianBeauty!** Please refrain from just stating a skin concern then expecting people to build a routine from scratch.  It is important to do due diligence in understanding your skin type and needs. Learn more here in [The AB Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/theabroutine) or [The Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/index). You can also [search the subreddit here](https://www.narfar.com/r/asianbeauty).

**Non-AB questions or comments.** Having non-AB products in your routine is totally fine! Getting specific advice/recommendations is not allowed. See our rules on [non-AB here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/rules#wiki_14._topics.2C_routines.2C_and_recommendations_must_be_related_to_asian_beauty)

**Rude comments and snark.** Fairly self explanatory but for more detail, check out our [Posting Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/wiki/postguidelines)

**When directing someone to the sidebar...** provide specific links. I.e. for someone asking about Allergies or Beginner Guides, link them to the specific subsections within AB University, rather than saying *it’s in the sidebar.*

**Finally, a reminder that no one is obligated to answer your questions.** If you have repeatedly asked the same question without a response, it may be best to review and see if it can be reworded or if the information is readily available in the sidebar materials.

**Remember that all skincare is individual and Your Mileage May Vary with recommendations. We are enthusiasts, not doctors, and we cannot provide you with medical advice. Speak to a medical professional if your skin concerns are affecting your well-being.**

Trying to find cooling shampoo I used at a Tokyo onsen,"I hope this post is allowed here.

I'm trying to find anything on a particular cooling shampoo that I used at a Tokyo onsen and I've stretched out my Google skills in my jetlagged haze.

Am back home now so can't go back, but maybe if I describe it a bit, someone here can help me.

It was the Thermae-Yu onsen in Shinjuku, and it was a medium blue bottle (shampoo only) with the word ""cool"" in an oval on the front above its name in hiragana (I think?).  There was also a corresponding shower gel (""body shampoo"") in a lighter blue bottle, also with the ""cool"" in an oval over the brand name.

I know this isn't a lot to go on, but hoping to get something that mighy lead me closer to it, at least!",1562213264.0,0.85,11

Anyone familiar with Bonajour Elf Skin Toner?,"Hi I'm fairly new to AB and while looking for a toner with ferments I came across this on Amazon and the ingredients look awesome.

[Discussion] Does your skin get tanner from the sun through car windows?,"Obviously  your skin gets darker over time when exposed to the sun which causes  the skin cells to produce the dark skin pigment melanin.

[Discussion]How much time and money do you spend on skincare?,"Researching products, finding retailers, deciding exactly which product to get, testing them, keeping up with news, sales, and hype products, applying them daily, organizing them, restocking, etc. takes up a lot of time. 

Not to mention the money it all requires.

I'm wondering how much time and money other people spend on skincare.

Maybe even some role models? Would love to know some highly productive people with a skincare regime that isn't some cosmetologist or youtuber. Just an ordinary person like me.",1562201781.0,0.95,43

Are there any other low pH cleansers you recommend? Maybe not as low as cosrx, which i think is pH 5. Because im not sure my skin is too happy at pH 5 … I don’t know:(",1562180672.0,0.86,3
